This study has developed a Markov chain (MC) model, which uses a two-state MC process with two parameters (wet-to-wet and dry-to-dry transition probabilities) to simulate rainfall occurrence and a gamma distribution with two parameters (mean and standard deviation of wet day rainfall) to simulate wet day rainfall depths. Starting with the traditional MC-gamma model with deterministic parameters, this study has developed and assessed four other variants of the MC-gamma model with different parameterisations. The key finding is that if the parameters of the gamma distribution are randomly sampled each year from fitted distributions rather than fixed parameters with time, the variability of rainfall depths at both short and longer temporal resolutions can be preserved, while the variability of wet periods (i.e. number of wet days and mean length of wet spell) can be preserved by decadally varied MC parameters. This is a straightforward enhancement to the traditional simplest MC model and is both objective and parsimonious. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:33","2018-01-19 22:50:33","","6541-6558","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Markov chain; Rain; Transition probabilities; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; Gamma distribution; parameter estimation; parameterization; model test; Probability distributions; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; stochasticity; precipitation assessment; Markov processes; diurnal variation; resolution; Daily rainfall model; Long-term variability; Mean and standard deviations; Primary objective; Stochastic rainfall generations; Temporal resolution; valuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The IMERG products are available in the form of near-real-time data, i.e., IMERG Early and Late, and in the form of post-real-time research data, i.e., IMERG Final, after monthly rain gauge analysis is received and taken into account. In this study, IMERG version 3 Early, Late, and Final (IMERG-E,IMERG-L, and IMERG-F) half-hourly rainfall estimates are compared with gauge-based gridded rainfall data from theWegenerNet Feldbach region (WEGN) high-density climate station network in southeastern Austria. The comparison is conducted over two IMERG 0.1° ×0.1° grid cells, entirely covered by 40 and 39 WEGN stations each, using data from the extended summer season (April-October) for the first two years of the GPM mission. The entire data are divided into two rainfall intensity ranges (low and high) and two seasons (warm and hot), and we evaluate the performance of IMERG, using both statistical and graphical methods. Results show that IMERGF rainfall estimates are in the best overall agreement with the WEGN data, followed by IMERG-L and IMERG-E estimates, particularly for the hot season. We also illustrate, through rainfall event cases, how insufficient PMW sources and errors in motion vectors can lead to wide discrepancies in the IMERG estimates. Finally, by applying the method of Villarini and Krajewski (2007), we find that IMERG-F halfhourly rainfall estimates can be regarded as a 25 min gauge accumulation, with an offset of C40 min relative to its nominal time. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:33","2018-01-19 22:50:33","","6559-6572","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; rainfall; data set; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation (climatology); Gages; raingauge; Austria; Climate stations; Global precipitation measurements; Graphical methods; Near real-time datum; Passive microwaves; precipitation intensity; Rain gages; Rainfall estimates; Rainfall intensity; satellite constellation; Satellite retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These properties are root radial conductivity and axial conductance, which control, respectively, the radial water flow between the root surface and xylem and the axial flow within the xylem. From the solution for the xylem water potential, functions that describe the radial and axial flow along the root axis were derived. These solutions can also be used to derive root macroscopic parameters that are potential input parameters of hydrological and crop models. In this paper, novel analytical solutions of the water flow equation are developed for roots whose hydraulic properties vary along their axis, which is the case for most plants. We derived solutions for single roots with linear or exponential variations of hydraulic properties with distance to root tip. These solutions were subsequently combined to construct single roots with complex hydraulic property profiles. The analytical solutions allow one to verify numerical solutions and to get a generalization of the hydric behaviour with the main influencing parameters of the solutions. The resulting flow distributions in heterogeneous roots differed from those in uniform roots and simulations led to more regular, less abrupt variations of xylem suction or radial flux along root axes. The model could successfully be applied to maize effective root conductance measurements to derive radial and axial hydraulic properties. We also show that very contrasted root water uptake patterns arise when using either uniform or heterogeneous root hydraulic properties in a soil-root model. The optimal root radius that maximizes water uptake under a carbon cost constraint was also studied. The optimal radius was shown to be highly dependent on the root hydraulic properties and close to observed properties in maize roots. We finally used the obtained functions for evaluating the impact of root maturation versus root growth on water uptake. Very diverse uptake strategies arise from the analysis. These solutions open new avenues to investigate for optimal genotype-environment-management interactions by optimization, for example, of plant-scale macroscopic hydraulic parameters used in ecohydrogolocial models. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:34","2018-01-19 22:50:34","","6519-6540","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; ecohydrology; Hydraulics; agricultural modeling; water flow; Flow of water; Carbon; Plants (botany); Zea mays; Axial flow; Conductance measurement; Environment management; Exponential variation; genotype-environment interaction; Hydraulic parameters; Hydraulic properties; hydraulic property; Influencing parameters; Macroscopic parameters; morphology; root; water uptake; xylem; Xylem water potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate the response of the hydrological cycle to the GFGP measures based in a case study of the Yanhe Basin, a typical hilly-gully area on the Loess Plateau of China. First, we analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) changes from 1990 to 2010. Then, we evaluated the effects of LULC changes and sloping land conversion on the main hydrological components in the basin using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results indicated that cropland exhibited a decreasing trend, declining from 40.2ĝ€% of the basin area in 1990 to 17.6ĝ€% in 2010, and that the woodland and grassland areas correspondingly increased. With the land use changes from 1990 to 2010, the water yield showed a decreasing trend which was mainly due to decrease in surface runoff. In contrast, evapotranspiration (ET) showed an increasing trend over the same period, resulting in a persistent decrease in soil water. The conversion of sloping cropland to grassland or woodland exerted negative effects on water yield and soil water. Compared with the land use condition in 2010, the negative effects were most evident where cropland with a slopeĝ€ ≥ ĝ€15° was converted to woodland, with decreases in surface runoff and soil water of 17.1 and 6.4ĝ€%, respectively. These results suggest that the expansive reforestation on sloping land in the loess hilly-gully region decreased water yield and increased ET, resulting in reduced soil water. The results of this study can be used to support sustainable land use planning and water resource management on the Loess Plateau in China. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:34","2018-01-19 22:50:34","","6485-6499","","12","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; land cover; Sediments; Land use; Sustainable land use; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; soil and water assessment tool; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Landforms; complexity; hydrological response; land use change; Waterresource management; agricultural land; Reforestation; grassland; Hydrological effects; Land use and land cover; Loess hilly gully region; Loess Plateau; Loess plateau of chinas; reforestation; Shaanxi; Spatiotemporal response; woodland; Yanhe Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world, storage levels are either not measured or not readily available due to financial, political, or legal considerations. This paper proposes a novel approach using Landsat imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs) to retrieve information on storage variations in any inaccessible region. Unlike existing approaches, the method does not require any in situ measurement and is appropriate for monitoring small, and often undocumented, irrigation reservoirs. It consists of three recovery steps: (i) a 2-D dynamic classification of Landsat spectral band information to quantify the surface area of water, (ii) a statistical correction of DEM data to characterize the topography of each reservoir, and (iii) a 3-D reconstruction algorithm to correct for clouds and Landsat 7 Scan Line Corrector failure. The method is applied to quantify reservoir storage in the Yarmouk basin in southern Syria, where ground monitoring is impeded by the ongoing civil war. It is validated against available in situ measurements in neighbouring Jordanian reservoirs. Coefficients of determination range from 0.69 to 0.84, and the normalized root-mean-square error from 10 to 16g % for storage estimations on six Jordanian reservoirs with maximal water surface areas ranging from 0.59 to 3.79g km2.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:35","2018-01-19 22:50:35","","6445-6459","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","algorithm; classification; reservoir; remote sensing; topography; Information management; Remote sensing; in situ measurement; Digital storage; Classification (of information); digital elevation model; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; Digital elevation model; Surveying; Reservoirs (water); monitoring; 3-D reconstruction algorithms; Dynamic classification; Effective management; information; Irrigation reservoirs; Jordan; Landsat; Reservoir management; satellite imagery; Satellite remote sensing; Scan line correctors; storage; surface area; Syrian Arab Republic; Yarmouk Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that, with high temporal resolution data, we are able to identify simple dynamic models that capture the P load dynamics in three contrasting agricultural catchments in the UK. For a flashy catchment, a linear, second-order (two pathways) model for discharge gave high simulation efficiencies for short-term storm sequences and was useful in highlighting uncertainties in out-of-bank flows. A model with non-linear rainfall input was appropriate for predicting seasonal or annual cumulative P loads where antecedent conditions affected the catchment response. For second-order models, the time constant for the fast pathway varied between 2 and 15ĝ€h for all three catchments and for both discharge and P, confirming that high temporal resolution data are necessary to capture the dynamic responses in small catchments (10-50ĝ€km2). The models led to a better understanding of the dominant nutrient transfer modes, which will be helpful in determining phosphorus transfers following changes in precipitation patterns in the future.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:37","2018-01-19 22:50:37","","6425-6444","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United Kingdom; Water quality; catchment; prediction; rainfall; surface water; data set; water quality; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Agriculture; runoff; Catchments; Storms; ecosystem health; precipitation (climatology); peak discharge; nutrient dynamics; Nutrients; frequency analysis; Phosphorus; Agricultural catchments; antecedent conditions; Catchment response; High frequency data; High temporal resolution; Phosphorus transfer; Precipitation patterns; Second-order models; Simulation efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate nonstationarity and trends in the short-duration precipitation extremes in selected urbanized locations in Southern Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the potential of nonstationary intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves, which form an input to civil infrastructural design. Despite apparent signals of nonstationarity in precipitation extremes in all locations, the stationary vs. nonstationary models do not exhibit any significant differences in the design storm intensity, especially for short recurrence intervals (up to 10 years). The signatures of nonstationarity in rainfall extremes do not necessarily imply the use of nonstationary IDFs for design considerations. When comparing the proposed IDFs with current design standards, for return periods (10 years or less) typical for urban drainage design, current design standards require an update of up to 7ĝ€%, whereas for longer recurrence intervals (50-100 years), ideal for critical civil infrastructural design, updates ranging between ĝ1/4 2 and 44ĝ€% are suggested.

The 3-dimensional model FLEXPART v9.0 was utilized. An important advantage of this model is that it permits the computation of the freshwater budget on air parcel trajectories both backward and forward in time from 0.1 to 1000ĝ€hPa in the atmospheric vertical column. The analysis was conducted for the westerly precipitation regime (WPR) (November-April) and the monsoonal precipitation regime (MPR) (May-October) in the period from 1981 to 2015. The main terrestrial and oceanic climatological moisture sources for the IRB, GRB, and BRB and their contribution to precipitation over the basins were identified. For the three basins, the most important moisture sources for precipitation are (i) in the continental regions, the land masses to the west of the basins (in this case called western Asia), the Indian region (IR), and the basin itself, and (ii) from the ocean, the utmost sources being the Indian Ocean (IO) and the Bay of Bengal (BB), and it is remarkable that despite the amount of moisture reaching the Indus and Ganges basins from land sources, the moisture supply from the IO seems to be first associated with the rapid increase or decrease in precipitation over the sources in the MPR. The technique of the composites was used to analyse how the moisture uptake values spatially vary from the sources (the budget of evaporation minus precipitation (<i>E</i> ĝ' <i>P</i>) was computed in a backward experiment from the basins) but during the pre-onset and pre-demise dates of the monsoonal rainfall over each basin; this confirmed that over the last days of the monsoon at the basins, the moisture uptake areas decrease in the IO.

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (Kd). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue-different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: Kd, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which Kd is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of Kd could reduce modeling uncertainty. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:45","2018-01-19 22:50:45","","6345-6362","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Sensitivity analysis; sensitivity analysis; climate modeling; land surface; Computer software; Open source software; software; climate change; parameter estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; Software engineering; numerical model; Problem solving; Open systems; seasonal variation; one-dimensional modeling; uncertainty analysis; C++ (programming language); Continuous measurements; Lakes; diurnal variation; Heat flux; Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation; extinction coefficient; Glues; Gluing; heat flux; lake; Light extinction; Light extinction coefficients; Parameter sensitivity analysis; Posterior likelihood; Problem solving environments; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Turbulent transports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these wetland ecosystems are dependent on local climate and hydrology, and are therefore at risk due to climate and land use change. This study develops site-specific empirical hydrologic models for five forested wetlands with different characteristics by analyzing long-term observed meteorological and hydrological data. These wetlands represent typical cypress ponds/swamps, Carolina bays, pine flatwoods, drained pocosins, and natural bottomland hardwood ecosystems. The validated empirical models are then applied at each wetland to predict future water table changes using climate projections from 20 general circulation models (GCMs) participating in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We show that combined future changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration would significantly alter wetland hydrology including groundwater dynamics by the end of the 21st century. Compared to the historical period, all five wetlands are predicted to become drier over time. The mean water table depth is predicted to drop by 4 to 22â cm in response to the decrease in water availability (i.e., precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) by the year 2100. Among the five examined wetlands, the depressional wetland in hot and humid Florida appears to be most vulnerable to future climate change.

Although intense 1- or 2-year droughts are recurrent in this Mediterranean-like region, the ongoing event stands out because of its longevity and large extent. The extraordinary character of the so-called central Chile megadrought (MD) was established against century long historical records and a millennial tree-ring reconstruction of regional precipitation. The largest MD-averaged rainfall relative anomalies occurred in the northern, semi-arid sector of central Chile, but the event was unprecedented to the south of 35° S. ENSO-neutral conditions have prevailed since 2011 (except for the strong El Niño in 2015), contrasting with La Niña conditions that often accompanied past droughts. The precipitation deficit diminished the Andean snowpack and resulted in amplified declines (up to 90 %) of river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels along central Chile and westernmost Argentina. In some semi-arid basins we found a decrease in the runoff-to-rainfall coefficient. A substantial decrease in vegetation productivity occurred in the shrubland-dominated, northern sector, but a mix of greening and browning patches occurred farther south, where irrigated croplands and exotic forest plantations dominate. The ongoing warming in central Chile, making the MD one of the warmest 6-year periods on record, may have also contributed to such complex vegetation changes by increasing potential evapotranspiration. We also report some of the measures taken by the central government to relieve the MD effects and the public perception of this event. The understanding of the nature and biophysical impacts of the MD helps as a foundation for preparedness efforts to confront a dry, warm future regional climate scenario. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:49","2018-01-19 22:50:49","","6307-6327","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Vegetation; drought; groundwater; potential evapotranspiration; rainfall-runoff modeling; river flow; snowpack; tree ring; Climatology; regional climate; Argentina; Drought; Chile; Groundwater; precipitation (climatology); agricultural land; Irrigated cropland; Mediterranean Region; Potential evapotranspiration; historical record; Andes; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Exotic forest plantations; Historical records; La Nina; multireservoir system; Nickel; plantation forestry; Precipitation deficits; shrubland; Tree-ring reconstruction; vegetation dynamics; Vegetation productivity; Western south america","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (1911- 2014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:51","2018-01-19 22:50:51","","6253-6274","","12","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water quality; climate change; water quality; Temperature; Ecology; Wind; wind velocity; morphometry; lake water; Lakes; Heat flux; water temperature; hydrological response; air temperature; Atmospheric temperature; Changing climate; Ecological consequences; epilimnion; hypolimnion; mixing; Pearson correlation; Sensible heat flux; Speed; stratification; Surface heat fluxes; thermal structure; Thermal structure; Thermal variables; Water temperatures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, variably saturated flow processes determine whether peatlands act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon, and modelling these processes is crucial to assess effects of changed environmental conditions on the future development of these ecosystems. We show that the Richards equation can be used to accurately describe the moisture dynamics under evaporative conditions in variably saturated peat soil, encompassing the transition from the topmost living moss layer to the decomposed peat as part of the vadose zone. Soil hydraulic properties (SHP) were identified by inverse simulation of evaporation experiments on samples from the entire acrotelm. To obtain consistent descriptions of the observations, the traditional van Genuchten-Mualem model was extended to account for non-capillary water storage and flow. We found that the SHP of the uppermost moss layer reflect a pore-size distribution (PSD) that combines three distinct pore systems of the Sphagnum moss. For deeper samples, acrotelm pedogenesis changes the shape of the SHP due to the collapse of inter-plant pores and an infill with smaller particles. This leads to gradually more homogeneous and bi-modal PSDs with increasing depth, which in turn can serve as a proxy for increasing state of pedogenesis in peatlands. From this, we derive a nomenclature and size classification for the pore spaces of Sphagnum mosses and define inter-, intra-, and inner-plant pore spaces, with effective pore diameters of > 300, 300-30, and 30-10 μm, respectively. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:53","2018-01-19 22:50:53","","6185-6200","","12","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Atmospheric chemistry; Environmental conditions; numerical model; Soil hydraulic properties; soil water; Soils; vadose zone; Carbon; hydraulic conductivity; Moisture; Wetlands; Bryophyta; diffusion; environmental conditions; Inverse simulation; ombrotrophic environment; Ombrotrophic peatlands; Peat; peatland; pedogenesis; Pore size; pore space; redox potential; Size classification; soil organic matter; Sphagnum; Unsaturated hydraulic properties; unsaturated medium; Van Genuchten-Mualem models; Variably saturated flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study of a ""lab in the field"" called the ""River Lab"" (RL), based on the idea of permanently installing a suite of laboratory instruments in the field next to a river. Housed in a small shed, this set of instruments performs analyses at a frequency of one every 40 min for major dissolved species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-) through continuous sampling and filtration of the river water using automated ion chromatographs. The RL was deployed in the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory, France for over a year of continuous analyses. Results show that the RL is able to capture long-term fine chemical variations with no drift and a precision significantly better than conventionally achieved in the laboratory (up to ±0.5 % for all major species for over a day and up to 1.7 % over 2 months). The RL is able to capture the abrupt changes in dissolved species concentrations during a typical 6-day rain event, as well as daily oscillations during a hydrological low-flow period of summer drought. Using the measured signals as a benchmark, we numerically assess the effects of a lower sampling frequency (typical of conventional field sampling campaigns) and of a lower precision (typically reached in the laboratory) on the hydrochemical signal. The high-resolution, high-precision measurements made possible by the RL open new perspectives for understanding critical zone hydro-bio-geochemical cycles. Finally, the RL also offers a solution for management agencies to monitor water quality in quasi-real time. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:55","2018-01-19 22:50:55","","6153-6165","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; catchment; drought; hydrochemistry; water quality; Rivers; concentration (composition); Catchments; river water; data acquisition; biogeochemical cycle; chemical analysis; Continuous analysis; Continuous sampling; Geochemical cycles; High frequency HF; High-precision measurement; instrumentation; Ion chromatographs; Laboratories; laboratory method; river channel; Sampling frequencies; Species concentration; streamwater; water chemistry; Water filtration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vulnerability studies typically evaluate the variable interplay of surface factors (land management, infiltration patterns) and subsurface factors (hydrostratigraphy, flow properties) in a thorough way, but disregard the resulting groundwater quality. Conversely, hydrogeochemical case studies that address the chemical evolution of groundwater often lack a comprehensive analysis of the structural buildup. In this study, we aim to reconstruct the actual spatial groundwater quality pattern from a synoptic analysis of the hydrostratigraphy, lithostratigraphy, pedology and land use in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (Hainich CZE). This CZE represents a widely distributed yet scarcely described setting of thin-bedded mixed carbonate-siliciclastic strata in hillslope terrains. At the eastern Hainich low-mountain hillslope, bedrock is mainly formed by alternated marine sedimentary rocks of the Upper Muschelkalk (Middle Triassic) that partly host productive groundwater resources. Spatial patterns of the groundwater quality of a 5.4km long well transect are derived by principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Aquifer stratigraphy and geostructural links were deduced from lithological drill core analysis, mineralogical analysis, geophysical borehole logs and mapping data. Maps of preferential recharge zones and recharge potential were deduced from digital (soil) mapping, soil survey data and field measurements of soil hydraulic conductivities (Ks). By attributing spatially variable surface and subsurface conditions, we were able to reconstruct groundwater quality clusters that reflect the type of land management in their preferential recharge areas, aquifer hydraulic conditions and cross-formational exchange via caprock sinkholes or ascending flow. Generally, the aquifer configuration (spatial arrangement of strata, valley incision/outcrops) and related geostructural links (enhanced recharge areas, karst phenomena) control the role of surface factors (input quality and locations) vs. subsurface factors (water-rock interaction, cross-formational flow) for groundwater quality in the multi-layered aquifer system. Our investigation reveals general properties of alternating sequences in hillslope terrains that are prone to forming multi-layered aquifer systems. This synoptic analysis is fundamental and indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of ecological functioning, sustainable resource management and protection. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:00","2018-01-19 22:51:00","","6091-6116","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Principal component analysis; Germany; Water quality; groundwater; water quality; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Land use; Mapping; spatial distribution; Soils; Landforms; Quality control; Hierarchical systems; hillslope; Chemical analysis; Soil surveys; recharge; Cluster analysis; land use; Recharging (underground waters); abiotic factor; aquifer characterization; bedrock; carbonate; Comprehensive analysis; Core analysis; Core drilling; Ecological functioning; geological structure; Hainich; Hierarchical cluster analysis; hydraulics; Hydrochemistry; land management; Lithology; Mineralogical analysis; Muschelkalk; sedimentary rock; Sedimentary rocks; siliciclastic deposit; sinkhole; Soil hydraulic conductivity; Stratigraphy; Surface-subsurface interactions; Sustainable resource management; Thuringia; Water rock interactions; Well logging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite these developments, validation and calibration of these products has been limited because of a lack of observations on corresponding scales. A recently developed mobile soil moisture monitoring platform, known as the ""rover"", offers opportunities to overcome this scale issue. This paper describes methods, results and testing of soil moisture estimates produced using rover surveys on a range of scales that are commensurate with model and satellite retrievals. Our investigation involved static cosmic-ray neutron sensors and rover surveys across both broad (36×36 km at 9 km resolution) and intensive (10×10 km at 1 km resolution) scales in a cropping district in the Mallee region of Victoria, Australia. We describe approaches for converting rover survey neutron counts to soil moisture and discuss the factors controlling soil moisture variability. We use independent gravimetric and modelled soil moisture estimates collected across both space and time to validate rover soil moisture products. Measurements revealed that temporal patterns in soil moisture were preserved through time and regression modelling approaches were utilised to produce time series of property-scale soil moisture which may also have applications in calibration and validation studies or local farm management. Intensivescale rover surveys produced reliable soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution while broad-scale surveys produced soil moisture estimates at 9 km resolution. We conclude that the multiscale soil moisture products produced in this study are well suited to future analysis of satellite soil moisture retrievals and finer-scale soil moisture models. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:02","2018-01-19 22:51:02","","6049-6067","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Calibration; satellite data; soil moisture; regression analysis; Victoria; land surface; Victoria [Australia]; temporal analysis; Surface measurement; Satellites; calibration; model validation; Soil moisture; Soils; time series; Calibration and validations; Moisture; cosmic ray; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; gravimetry; Land-surface process; Mallee; Moisture control; Moisture variability; Regression modelling; Satellite soil moisture; Soil moisture monitoring; Soil moisture sensors; Soil testing; Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transition of TRMM into the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) promises enhanced spatio-temporal resolution along with upgrades to sensors and rainfall estimation techniques. The dependence of systematic error components in rainfall estimates of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), and their variation with climatology and topography, was evaluated over 86 basins in India for year 2014 and compared with the corresponding (2014) and retrospective (1998-2013) TRMM estimates. IMERG outperformed TRMM for all rainfall intensities across a majority of Indian basins, with significant improvement in low rainfall estimates showing smaller negative biases in 75 out of 86 basins. Low rainfall estimates in TRMM showed a systematic dependence on basin climatology, with significant overprediction in semi-arid basins, which gradually improved in the higher rainfall basins. Medium and high rainfall estimates of TRMM exhibited a strong dependence on basin topography, with declining skill in higher elevation basins. The systematic dependence of error components on basin climatology and topography was reduced in IMERG, especially in terms of topography. Rainfall-runoff modeling using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model over two flood-prone basins (Mahanadi and Wainganga) revealed that improvement in rainfall estimates in IMERG did not translate into improvement in runoff simulations.

Much less attention is paid to the use of input data and optimal construction of training images. For instance, even though the training image should capture a set of spatial geological characteristics to guide the simulations, the majority of the research still relies on 2-D or quasi-3-D training images. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel strategy for 3-D MPS modelling characterized by (i) realistic 3-D training images and (ii) an effective workflow for incorporating a diverse group of geological and geophysical data sets. The study covers an area of 2810km2 in the southern part of Denmark. MPS simulations are performed on a subset of the geological succession (the lower to middle Miocene sediments) which is characterized by relatively uniform structures and dominated by sand and clay. The simulated domain is large and each of the geostatistical realizations contains approximately 45 million voxels with size 100m × 100m × 5m. Data used for the modelling include water well logs, high-resolution seismic data, and a previously published 3-D geological model. We apply a series of different strategies for the simulations based on data quality, and develop a novel method to effectively create observed spatial trends. The training image is constructed as a relatively small 3-D voxel model covering an area of 90km2. We use an iterative training image development strategy and find that even slight modifications in the training image create significant changes in simulations. Thus, this study shows how to include both the geological environment and the type and quality of input information in order to achieve optimal results from MPS modelling. We present a practical workflow to build the training image and effectively handle different types of input information to perform large-scale geostatistical modelling. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:06","2018-01-19 22:51:06","","6069-6089","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Denmark; simulation; data set; statistical analysis; Uncertainty analysis; hydrogeology; three-dimensional modeling; uncertainty analysis; image analysis; geostatistics; data quality; Iterative methods; Seismology; Well logging; Geological characteristics; Geological environment; Geology; geophysics; Geostatistical modelling; Geostatistical simulation; High resolution seismic data; Hydrogeological models; Multiple-point statistics; Planning; Structural uncertainty; Water wells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FoGSS uses climate forecasts from a coupled ocean-land-atmosphere prediction system, post-processed with the method of calibration, bridging and merging.

In all perennial and many ephemeral catchments, FoGSS provides an effective alternative to resampled historical inflow sequences. FoGSS generally produces skilful forecasts at shorter lead times ( &lt; ĝ€4 months), and transits to climatology-like forecasts at longer lead times. Forecasts are generally reliable and unbiased. However, FoGSS does not perform well in very dry catchments (catchments that experience zero flows more than half the time in some months), sometimes producing strongly negative forecast skill and poor reliability. We attempt to improve forecasts through the use of (i) ESP rainfall forcings, (ii) different rainfall-runoff models, and (iii) a Bayesian prior to encourage the error model to return climatology forecasts in months when the rainfall-runoff model performs poorly. Of these, the use of the prior offers the clearest benefit in very dry catchments, where it moderates strongly negative forecast skill and reduces bias in some instances. However, the prior does not remedy poor reliability in very dry catchments.<br><br> Overall, FoGSS is an attractive alternative to historical inflow sequences in all but the driest catchments.

If they are able to reproduce the relevant flow and storage processes of a karst system, they can be used for prediction of water resource availability when climate or land use are expected to change. A common challenge to apply karst simulation models is the limited availability of observations to identify their model parameters. In this study, we quantify the value of information when water quality data (NO3ĝ' and SO42ĝ') is used in addition to discharge observations to estimate the parameters of a process-based karst simulation model at a test site in southern Spain. We use a three-step procedure to (1) confine an initial sample of 500ĝ€000 model parameter sets by discharge and water quality observations, (2) identify alterations of model parameter distributions through the confinement, and (3) quantify the strength of the confinement for the model parameters. We repeat this procedure for flow states, for which the system discharge is controlled by the unsaturated zone, the saturated zone, and the entire time period including times when the spring is influenced by a nearby river. Our results indicate that NO3ĝ' provides the most information to identify the model parameters controlling soil and epikarst dynamics during the unsaturated flow state. During the saturated flow state, SO42ĝ' and discharge observations provide the best information to identify the model parameters related to groundwater processes. We found reduced parameter identifiability when the entire time period is used as the river influence disturbs parameter estimation. We finally show that most reliable simulations are obtained when a combination of discharge and water quality date is used for the combined unsaturated and saturated flow states. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:11","2018-01-19 22:51:11","","5971-5985","","12","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; discharge; groundwater; river discharge; Hydrological models; Spain; water quality; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Land use; water resource; resource availability; vadose zone; resource management; Landforms; Digital storage; river water; Discharge observations; land use change; Groundwater process; karst; Karst water resources; Model parameter sets; Parameter identifiability; Resource availability; unsaturated flow; Value of information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a distributed rainfall-runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested in the regions of Alès and Draguignan, located in the south of France, where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as against local reference or observed flood extent maps.

Therefore, the data assimilation system DasPy is coupled to the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) as well as to the Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM). Brightness temperature climatologies are precomputed to enable the assimilation of brightness temperature anomalies, making use of 6 years of SMOS data (2010-2015). Mean correlation R with in situ measurements increases moderately from 0.61 to 0.68 (11%) for upper soil layers if the root zone is included in the updates. A reduced improvement of 5% is achieved if the assimilation is restricted to the upper soil layers. Root-zone simulations improve by 7% when updating both the top layers and root zone, and by 4% when only updating the top layers. Mean increments and increment standard deviations are compared for the experiments. The long-term assimilation impact is analysed by looking at a set of quantiles computed for soil moisture at each grid cell. Within hydrological monitoring systems, extreme dry or wet conditions are often defined via their relative occurrence, adding great importance to assimilation-induced quantile changes.

Water balance modelling is often used to proportion recharge components and guide sustainable groundwater allocations. However, it is not common practice to use hydrochemical evidence to inform and constrain these models. Here we compare geochemical versus water balance model estimates of artesian discharge into an alluvial aquifer, and demonstrate why multi-tracer geochemical analyses should be used as a critical component of water budget assessments. We selected a site in Australia where the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), the largest artesian basin in the world, discharges into the Lower Namoi Alluvium (LNA), an extensively modelled aquifer, to convey the utility of our approach. Water stable isotopes and the concentrations of Na+ and HCO3g suggest a continuum of mixing in the alluvial aquifer between the GAB (artesian component) and surface recharge, whilst isotopic tracers (3H, 14C, and 36Cl) indicate that the alluvial groundwater is a mixture of groundwaters with residence times of 70 years and groundwater that is potentially hundreds of thousands of years old, which is consistent with that of the GAB. In addition, Clg concentrations provide a means to calculate a percentage estimate of the artesian contribution to the alluvial groundwater. In some locations, an artesian contribution of up to 70g is evident from the geochemical analyses, a finding that contrasts with previous regional-scale water balance modelling estimates that attributed 22g of all inflow for the corresponding zone within the LNA to GAB discharge. Our results show that hydrochemical investigations need to be undertaken as part of developing the conceptual framework of a catchment water balance model, as they can improve our understanding of recharge pathways and better constrain artesian discharge to an alluvial aquifer. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:17","2018-01-19 22:51:17","","5953-5969","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; discharge; groundwater; Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; Climate models; aquifer; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater resources; resource allocation; conceptual framework; Catchments; Budget control; geochemistry; Ground water discharge; Water balance models; Isotopes; stable isotope; tracer; groundwater resource; Recharging (underground waters); Hydrochemistry; Analytical geochemistry; artesian well; Catchment water balance; Conceptual frameworks; Geochemical analysis; Geochemistry; Great Artesian Basin; Multi-tracer approach; Sustainable groundwater; Water stable isotopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes over the 21st century under two warming scenarios in different percentiles of the probability distribution of streamflow, and particularly of high and low streamflow extremes (95th and 5th percentiles), are analyzed using an ensemble of bias-corrected global climate model (GCM) fields fed into different global hydrological models (GHMs) provided by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) to understand the changes in streamflow distribution and simultaneous vulnerability to different types of hydrological risk in different regions. In the multi-model mean under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario, 37ĝ€ and Macr;% of global land areas experience an increase in magnitude of extremely high streamflow (with an average increase of 24.5ĝ€ and Macr;%), potentially increasing the chance of flooding in those regions. On the other hand, 43ĝ€ and Macr;% of global land areas show a decrease in the magnitude of extremely low streamflow (average decrease of 51.5ĝ€ and Macr;%), potentially increasing the chance of drought in those regions. About 10ĝ€ and Macr;% of the global land area is projected to face simultaneously increasing high extreme streamflow and decreasing low extreme streamflow, reflecting the potentially worsening hazard of both flood and drought; further, these regions tend to be highly populated parts of the globe, currently holding around 30ĝ€ and Macr;% of the world's population (over 2.1 billion people). In a world more than 4° warmer by the end of the 21st century compared to the pre-industrial era (RCP8.5 scenario), changes in magnitude of streamflow extremes are projected to be about twice as large as in a 2° warmer world (RCP2.6 scenario). Results also show that inter-GHM uncertainty in streamflow changes, due to representation of terrestrial hydrology, is greater than the inter-GCM uncertainty due to simulation of climate change. Under both forcing scenarios, there is high model agreement for increases in streamflow of the regions near and above the Arctic Circle, and consequent increases in the freshwater inflow to the Arctic Ocean, while subtropical arid areas experience a reduction in streamflow.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:19","2018-01-19 22:51:19","","5863-5874","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; drought; global warming; hydrological cycle; streamflow; climate modeling; Hydrological models; Global climate model; climate change; Drought; Risk perception; hydrological modeling; Floods; flooding; Climate models; global change; Probability distributions; global climate; Hydrology; flood; arid region; Stream flow; subtropical region; Global warming; Hydrological cycles; twenty first century; Arctic Ocean; freshwater environment; Freshwater inflow; Hydrological risks; Sectoral impacts; Streamflow changes; Streamflow distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. <br><br> Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: location (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80ĝ€%, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:21","2018-01-19 22:51:21","","5875-5889","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Sensitivity analysis; Water quality; catchment; global warming; groundwater; seasonality; water quality; anthropogenic effect; Groundwater; Catchments; Budget control; Lakes; environmental impact assessment; Population statistics; geochemistry; sustainable development; Sustainable development; water budget; Ground water recharge; recharge; Isotopes; stable isotope; Global warming; Recharging (underground waters); Hydrochemistry; Geochemistry; Anthropogenic impacts; Environmental change; Eutrophication; Geochemical characteristic; Groundwater exchanges; Groundwater geochemistry; ice-dammed lake; Indexing (of information); isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; Lacustrine ecosystems; lake ecosystem; population growth; Sustainable management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To simulate the stream flow of the ungauged zone, we built a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model for the entire catchment area covering the upstream gauged area and ungauged zone, and then calibrated the SWAT model using the data in the gauged area. To verify the results, we built two hydrodynamic scenarios (the original and adjusted scenarios) for Poyang Lake using the Delft3D model. In the original scenario, the upstream boundary condition is the observed stream flow from the upstream gauged area, while, in the adjusted scenario, it is the sum of the observed stream flow from the gauged area and the simulated stream flow from the ungauged zone. The experimental results showed that there is a stronger correlation and lower bias (R2 = 0.81, PBIAS=10.00 %) between the observed and simulated stream flow in the adjusted scenario compared to that (R2 = 0.77, PBIAS=20.10 %) in the original scenario, suggesting the simulated stream flow of the ungauged zone is reasonable. Using this method, we estimated the stream flow of the Poyang Lake ungauged zone as 16.4×6.2 billionm3 a-1, representing ∼11.24% of the annual total water yield of the entire watershed. Of the annual water yield, 70% (11.48 billionm3 a-1) is concentrated in the wet season, while 30% (4.92 billionm3 a-1) comes from the dry season. The ungauged stream flow significantly improves the water balance with the closing error decreased by 13.48 billionm3 a-1 (10.10% of the total annual water resource) from 30.20±9.1 billionm3 a-1 (20.10% of the total annual water resource) to 16.72±8.53 billionm3 a-1 (10.00% of the total annual water resource).

It lies at the interface between hydrology and environmental history, using methodologies from both disciplines basically with the goal of significantly extending the instrumental measurement period with experience from the pre-instrumental past. Recently this field of research has gained increased recognition as a tool to improve current flood risk estimations when EU guidelines regulated by law the quantitative consideration of previous floods.1 Awareness to consider pre-instrumental experience in flood risk analysis seems to have risen at the level of local and federal authorities in Switzerland as well. The 2011 Fukushima catastrophe probably fostered this rethinking process, when pressure from the media, society and politics as well as the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) forced the authorities to reassess the current flood risk analysis for Swiss nuclear power plants. In 2015 a historical hydrological study was commissioned by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) to assess the magnitudes of pre-instrumental Aare River flood discharges, including the most important tributaries (the Saane, Emme, Reuss and Limmat rivers). The results of the historical hydrological study serve now as the basis for the main study, EXAR (commissioned under the lead of FOEN in cooperation with the Swiss Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (ENSI), the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE), the Federal Office for Civil Protection (FOCP), and the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss)), which combines historical and climatological analysis with statistical approaches and mathematical models with the goal of better understanding the hazards and possible interactions that can be caused by extreme flood events. In a second phase the catchment of the River Rhine will be targeted as well. More recently several local historical hydrological studies of smaller catchments have been requested by the responsible local authorities. The course for further publicly requested historical hydrological analysis seems thus to have been set. This paper therefore intends to discuss the potential of historical hydrological analysis, with a focus on the specific situation in Switzerland.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:26","2018-01-19 22:51:26","","5781-5803","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Runoff; river discharge; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Rivers; Floods; risk assessment; numerical model; Catchments; flood control; Hydrology; extreme event; European Union; Switzerland; historical record; Aare River; catastrophic event; Climatological analysis; documentary source; Environmental history; Extreme flood events; Historical hydrologies; Hydrological analysis; Instrumental measurements; International atomic energy agency; Laws and legislation; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; nuclear power plant; Nuclear power plants; regulatory framework; Rhine River; Statistical approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we present an intercomparison of precipitation and shortwave radiation data from CN05.1, CMFD, CLDAS and GLDAS during 2008-2014. We also validate all four data sets against independent ground station observations. All four forcing data sets capture the spatial distribution of precipitation over major land areas of China, although CLDAS indicates smaller annual-mean precipitation amounts than CN05.1, CMFD or GLDAS. Time series of precipitation anomalies are largely consistent among the data sets, except for a sudden decrease in CMFD after August 2014. All forcing data indicate greater temporal variations relative to the mean in dry regions than in wet regions. Validation against independent precipitation observations provided by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River indicates that CLDAS provides the most realistic estimates of spatiotemporal variability in precipitation in this region. CMFD also performs well with respect to annual mean precipitation, while GLDAS fails to accurately capture much of the spatiotemporal variability and CN05.1 contains significant high biases relative to the MWR observations. Estimates of shortwave radiation from CMFD are largely consistent with station observations, while CLDAS and GLDAS greatly overestimate shortwave radiation. All three forcing data sets capture the key features of the spatial distribution, but estimates from CLDAS and GLDAS are systematically higher than those from CMFD over most of mainland China. Based on our evaluation metrics, CLDAS slightly outperforms GLDAS. CLDAS is also closer than GLDAS to CMFD with respect to temporal variations in shortwave radiation anomalies, with substantial differences among the time series. Differences in temporal variations are especially pronounced south of 34° N. Our findings provide valuable guidance for a variety of stakeholders, including land-surface modelers and data providers.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:28","2018-01-19 22:51:28","","5805-5821","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Land data assimilation systems; Time series; Water resources; gauge; data set; land surface; data assimilation; water resource; spatiotemporal analysis; stakeholder; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; Biogeochemistry; temporal variation; Spatiotemporal variability; precipitation intensity; Annual mean precipitation; Biogeochemical cycle; climate forcing; Meteorological forcing; Middle and lower reaches of the yangtze rivers; Precipitation anomalies; Radiation; Short-wave radiation; shortwave radiation; Water analysis; Yangtze River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a northern climate, where spring freshet constitutes the main inflow volume, seasonal forecasts can help to establish a yearly strategy. Long-term hydrological forecasts often rely on past observations of streamflow or meteorological data. Another alternative is to use ensemble meteorological forecasts produced by climate models. In this paper, those produced by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast) System 4 are examined and bias is characterized. Bias correction, through the linear scaling method, improves the performance of the raw ensemble meteorological forecasts in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Then, three seasonal ensemble hydrological forecasting systems are compared: (1) the climatology of simulated streamflow, (2) the ensemble hydrological forecasts based on climatology (ESP) and (3) the hydrological forecasts based on bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts from System 4 (corr-DSP). Simulated streamflow computed using observed meteorological data is used as benchmark. Accounting for initial conditions is valuable even for long-term forecasts. ESP and corr-DSP both outperform the climatology of simulated streamflow for lead times from 1 to 5 months depending on the season and watershed. Integrating information about future meteorological conditions also improves monthly volume forecasts. For the 1-month lead time, a gain exists for almost all watersheds during winter, summer and fall. However, volume forecasts performance for spring varies from one watershed to another. For most of them, the performance is close to the performance of ESP. For longer lead times, the CRPS skill score is mostly in favour of ESP, even if for many watersheds, ESP and corr-DSP have comparable skill. Corr-DSP appears quite reliable but, in some cases, under-dispersion or bias is observed. A more complex bias-correction method should be further investigated to remedy this weakness and take more advantage of the ensemble forecasts produced by the climate model. Overall, in this study, bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts appear to be an interesting source of information for hydrological forecasting for lead times up to 1 month. They could also complement ESP for longer lead times.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:31","2018-01-19 22:51:31","","5747-5762","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","streamflow; Climatology; climate modeling; flooding; Climate models; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Meteorology; watershed; seasonal variation; Watersheds; forecasting method; Reservoirs (water); ensemble forecasting; hydrometeorology; Stream flow; inflow; Hydrological forecasting; Reservoir management; Hydrological forecast; Bias-correction methods; climate conditions; Continuous ranked probability scores; Hydro power production; hydroelectric power; hydrological regime; Integrating information; Linear scaling method; Meteorological condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study both approaches are analyzed for cell-centered as well as vertex-centered finite difference schemes. It is shown that the dual node approach should be conceptualized and implemented as a one-sided first-order finite difference to approximate the vertical subsurface hydraulic gradient at the land surface. This results in a consistent dual node approach in which the coupling length is related to grid topology. In this coupling approach the coupling length is not to be interpreted as a nonphysical model parameter. Although this particular coupling approach is technically not new, the differences between this consistent dual node approach and the common node approach have not been studied in detail. In fact, this coupling scheme is often believed to be similar to the common node approach. In this study it is illustrated that in comparison to the common node approach, the head continuity at the surface-subsurface interface is formulated more correctly in the consistent dual node approach. Numerical experiments indicate that the consistent dual node approach is less sensitive to the vertical discretization when simulating excess infiltration. It is also found that the consistent dual node approach can be advantageous in terms of numerical efficiency. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:33","2018-01-19 22:51:33","","5709-5724","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Earth sciences; land surface; parameter estimation; numerical method; infiltration; conceptual framework; Hydrology; Discretizations; subsurface flow; Subsurface Flow; interface; Centered finite differences; Coupling length; efficiency measurement; Finite difference method; Hydraulic gradients; Model parameters; Numerical efficiency; Numerical experiments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This temporal and spatial heterogeneity affects surface hydrometeorological processes and must be taken into account in simulations of land surface and distributed hydrological models. The Sentinel-2 mission allows for the monitoring of land cover and vegetation dynamics at unprecedented spatial resolutions and revisit frequencies (20m and 5 days, respectively) that are fully compatible with such heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Here, we evaluate the impact of Sentinel-2-like remote sensing data on the simulation of surface water and energy fluxes via the Interactions between the Surface Biosphere Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model included in the EXternalized SURface (SURFEX) modeling platform. The study focuses on the effect of the leaf area index (LAI) spatial and temporal variability on these fluxes.We compare the use of the LAI climatology from ECOCLIMAPII, used by default in SURFEX-ISBA, and time series of LAI derived from the high-resolution Formosat-2 satellite data (8 m). The study area is an agricultural zone in southwestern France covering 576 km2 (24 km×24 km). An innovative plot-scale approach is used, in which each computational unit has a homogeneous vegetation type. Evaluation of the simulations quality is done by comparing model outputs with in situ eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux (LE). Our results show that the use of LAI derived from high-resolution remote sensing significantly improves simulated evapotranspiration with respect to ECOCLIMAP-II, especially when the surface is covered with summer crops. The comparison with in situ measurements shows an improvement of roughly 0.3 in the correlation coefficient and a decrease of around 30% of the root mean square error (RMSE) in the simulated evapotranspiration. This finding is attributable to a better description of LAI evolution processes with Formosat-2 data, which further modify soil water content and drainage of soil reservoirs. Effects on annual drainage patterns remain small but significant, i.e., an increase roughly equivalent to 4% of annual precipitation levels with simulations using Formosat-2 data in comparison to the reference simulation values. This study illustrates the potential for the Sentinel-2 mission to better represent effects of crop management on water budgeting for large, anthropized river basins. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:36","2018-01-19 22:51:36","","5693-5708","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Rain; Vegetation; evapotranspiration; satellite data; surface water; land surface; time series analysis; remote sensing; water content; heterogeneity; Surface measurement; Agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; Crops; Water and energy fluxes; Remote sensing; France; Budget control; Soil moisture; soil water; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Plants (botany); Surface waters; Quality control; Heat flux; latent heat flux; Mean square error; Reservoirs (water); hydrometeorology; agricultural land; Distributed hydrological model; vegetation dynamics; eddy covariance; Agricultural landscapes; crop rotation; Eddy covariance measurements; FORMOSAT; High resolution remote sensing; Hydrometeorological variables; leaf area index; observational method; Sentinel; Spatial and temporal variability; Water content","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to monitor the transformation of the flood wave and the sediment transport within the channel. Two series of experiments were carried out in contrasting initial conditions: (a) in September, when the stream banks were dry, the baseflow was negligible, and the channel was fully overgrown with vegetation; and (b) in March, when the stream banks were almost water saturated, the baseflow was above the annual average, and there was no vegetation present. Within each campaign, three successive flood waves, each with an approximate volume of 17m3 and peak flow of ca. 40 L s-1, were pumped into the upper part of the catchment drainage channel. The transformation of the flood wave and the sediment transport regime within an approximately 400m long channel section were monitored by measuring the discharge, the turbidity, and the electrical conductivity in three profiles along the stream. On the basis of the results, it was concluded that there is a considerable amount of deposited sediment, even in the well-trained and straight channel that can be re-mobilized by small floods. Part of the recorded sediment therefore originates from the particles deposited during previous soil erosion events. The flood waves initiated in dissimilar instream conditions progressed differently . we show that the saturation of the channel banks, the stream vegetation and the actual baseflow had a strong influence on the flood transformation and the sediment regime in the channel. The sediment moves quickly in winter and early spring, but in the later part of the year the channel serves as a sediment trap and the resuspension is slower, if dense vegetation is present.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:38","2018-01-19 22:51:38","","5681-5691","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Vegetation; discharge; Czech Republic; Floods; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Agriculture; Catchments; experimental study; soil erosion; flood; agricultural catchment; Agricultural catchments; streamwater; baseflow; Deposited sediments; Drainage channels; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Experimental determination; flood wave; Initial conditions; peak flow; resuspension; Sediment re suspensions; sediment trap; Straight channel; transformation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we comparatively evaluated the performance of the local calibration of a rainfall-runoff model against regional flow duration curves (FDCs), which is a seemingly alternative method of classical parameter regionalisation for ungauged catchments. We used a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model over 45 South Korean catchments under semi-humid climate. The calibration against regional FDCs was compared with the simple proximity-based parameter regionalisation. Results show that transferring behavioural parameters from gauged to ungauged catchments significantly outperformed the local calibration against regional FDCs due to the absence of flow timing information in the regional FDCs. The behavioural parameters gained from observed hydrographs were likely to contain intangible flow timing information affecting predictability in ungauged catchments. Additional constraining with the rising limb density appreciably improved the FDC calibrations, implying that flow signatures in temporal dimensions would supplement the FDCs. As an alternative approach in data-rich regions, we suggest calibrating a rainfall-runoff model against regionalised hydrographs to preserve flow timing information. We also suggest use of flow signatures that can supplement hydrographs for calibrating rainfall-runoff models in gauged and ungauged catchments.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:41","2018-01-19 22:51:41","","5647-5661","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Flow duration curve; Rain; Runoff; rainfall-runoff modeling; regionalization; South Korea; Climate models; comparative study; calibration; assessment method; Catchments; Rainfall - Runoff modelling; Rainfall-runoff models; hydrograph; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Comparative assessment; Temporal dimensions; Timing information; Ungauged catchment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study is focused on the Venice Lagoon, Italy, where the port authority is planning to open a new 10m deep and 3km long canal to connect the city passenger terminal to the central lagoon inlet, thus avoiding the passage of large cruise ships through the historic center of Venice. A modeling study has been developed to evaluate the short (minutes), medium (months), and long (decades) term processes of water and pollutant exchange between the shallow aquifer system and the lagoon, possibly enhanced by the canal excavation, and ship wakes. An in-depth characterization of the lagoon subsurface along the channel has supported the numerical modeling. Piezometer and sea level records, geophysical acquisitions, laboratory analyses of groundwater and sediment samples (chemical analyses and ecotoxicity testing), and the outcome of 3-D hydrodynamic and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models have been used to set up and calibrate the subsurface multi-model approach. The numerical outcomes allow us to quantify the groundwater volume and estimate the mass of anthropogenic contaminants (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se) likely leaked from the nearby industrial area over the past decades, and released into the lagoon from the canal bed by the action of depression waves generated by ships.

Six components of the watershed landscape are examined to evaluate the watershed health (basin natural capacity): stream geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, aquatic habitat condition, and biological condition. In particular, the SWAT is applied to the study basin for the hydrology and water-quality components, including 237 sub-watersheds (within a standard watershed on the Korea Hydrologic Unit Map) along with three multipurpose dams, one hydroelectric dam, and three multifunction weirs. The SWAT is calibrated (2005-2009) and validated (2010-2014) by using each dam and weir operation, the flux-tower evapotranspiration, the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture, and groundwater-level data for the hydrology assessment, and by using sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen data for the water-quality assessment. The water balance, which considers the surface-groundwater interactions and variations in the stream-water quality, is quantified according to the sub-watershed-scale relationship between the watershed hydrologic cycle and stream-water quality. We assess the integrated watershed health according to the U.S. EPA evaluation process based on the vulnerability levels of the natural environment, water resources, water quality, and ecosystem components. The results indicate that the watershed's health declined during the most recent 10-year period of 2005-2014, as indicated by the worse results for the surface process metric and soil water dynamics compared to those of the 1995-2004 period.

These human impacts include the effects of reservoir building and human water use, as well as land cover change. To date, many global studies have focussed on human water use, but only a few focus on or include the impact of land cover change. Here we use PCR-GLOBWB, a combined global hydrological and water resources model, to assess the impacts of land cover change as well as human water use globally in different climatic zones. Our results show that land cover change has a strong effect on the global hydrological cycle, on the same order of magnitude as the effect of human water use (applying irrigation, abstracting water, for industrial use for example, including reservoirs, etc.). When globally averaged, changing the land cover from that of 1850 to that of 2000 increases discharge through reduced evapotranspiration. The effect of land cover change shows large spatial variability in magnitude and sign of change depending on, for example, the specific land cover change and climate zone. Overall, land cover effects on evapotranspiration are largest for the transition of tall natural vegetation to crops in energy-limited equatorial and warm temperate regions. In contrast, the inclusion of irrigation, water abstraction and reservoirs reduces global discharge through enhanced evaporation over irrigated areas and reservoirs as well as through water consumption. Hence, in some areas land cover change and water distribution both reduce discharge, while in other areas the effects may partly cancel out. The relative importance of both types of impacts varies spatially across climatic zones. From this study we conclude that land cover change needs to be considered when studying anthropogenic impacts on water resources. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:47","2018-01-19 22:51:47","","5603-5626","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Water resources; discharge; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; reservoir; land cover; hydrological modeling; anthropogenic effect; water resource; Water supply systems; Water supply; Irrigation; irrigation system; spatial variation; water use; Reservoirs (water); Hydrological cycles; Anthropogenic impacts; Abstracting; Different climatic zones; Hydrological impacts; Reservoir buildings; Spatial variability; Water distributions; Water resources modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We first examine correlations, by applying power-spectral analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to a time series of the number of floods per decade, and find weak long-range persistence: a power-spectral exponent βPS ≈0.39 and an equivalent power-spectral exponent from DFA, βDFA ≈0.25. We then examine clustering using the one-point probability distribution of the inter-flood intervals and find that the palaeofloods cluster in time as they are Weibull distributed with a shape parameter kW = 0.78. We then examine cyclicity in the time series of number of palaeofloods per year, and find a period of about 2030 years. Using these characterizations of the correlation, clustering, and cyclicity in the original palaeoflood time series, we create a model consisting of the superposition of a fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) with a 2030-year periodic component and then peaks over threshold (POT) applied. We use this POTFGN+Period model to create 2 600 000 synthetic realizations of the same length as our original palaeoflood time series, but with varying intensity of periodicity and persistence, and find optimized model parameters that are congruent with our original palaeoflood series. We create long realizations of our optimized palaeoflood model, and find a high temporal variability of the flood frequency, which can take values of between 0 and gt; 30 floods century-1. Finally, we show the practical utility of our optimized model realizations to calculate the uncertainty of the forecasted number of floods per century with the number of floods in the preceding century. A key finding of our paper is that neither fractional noise behaviour nor cyclicity is sufficient to model frequency fluctuations of our large and continuous palaeoflood record, but rather a model based on both fractional noise superimposed with a long-range periodicity is necessary. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:49","2018-01-19 22:51:49","","5547-5581","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Time series; Time series analysis; cluster analysis; correlation; paleohydrology; hydrological modeling; Floods; Probability distributions; time series; historical record; Gaussian noise (electronic); Alps; Analysis and modelling; Bergamo; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn); interglacial; Lombardy; Long-range persistence; paleoflood; Peaks over threshold; periodicity; Pianico; Pleistocene; Power spectral analysis; Spectrum analysis; Synthetic realization; Temporal variability; Weibull distribution; Weibull theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three-dimensional simulations assumed the same column shape and size, grain size, snow density, and water input rate as the laboratory experiments. Model evaluation focused on the timing of water movement, thickness of the upper layer affected by ponding, water content profiles and wet snow fraction. Simulation results showed that the model reconstructs relevant features of capillary barriers, including ponding in the upper layer, preferential infiltration far from the interface, and the timing of liquid water arrival at the snow base. In contrast, the area of preferential flow paths was usually underestimated and consequently the averaged water content in areas characterized by preferential flow paths was also underestimated. Improving the representation of preferential infiltration into initially dry snow is necessary to reproduce the transition from a dry-snow-dominant condition to a wet-snow-dominant one, especially in long-period simulations. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:51","2018-01-19 22:51:51","","5503-5515","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; simulation; snowpack; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; Preferential flows; water content; runoff; Water supply systems; infiltration; three-dimensional modeling; forecasting method; Phase interfaces; experiment; snowmelt; Infiltration; laboratory method; Capillary barriers; Laboratory experiments; Liquids; Ponding; Relevant features; Runoff forecasting; snow cover; Three dimensional simulations; Water content profiles; Water transport models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, five decades (1961-2010) of naturalized and observed streamflow datasets are used to investigate hydrological drought characteristics in a heavily managed river basin, the Yellow River basin in north China. Human interventions decrease the correlation between hydrological and meteorological droughts, and make the hydrological drought respond to longer timescales of meteorological drought. Due to large water consumptions in the middle and lower reaches, there are 118-262ĝ€% increases in the hydrological drought frequency, up to 8-fold increases in the drought severity, 21-99ĝ€% increases in the drought duration and the drought onset is earlier. The non-stationarity due to anthropogenic climate change and human water use basically decreases the correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts and reduces the effect of human interventions on hydrological drought frequency while increasing the effect on drought duration and severity. A set of 29-year (1982-2010) hindcasts from an established seasonal hydrological forecasting system are used to assess the forecast skill of hydrological drought. In the naturalized condition, the climate-model-based approach outperforms the climatology method in predicting the 2001 severe hydrological drought event. Based on the 29-year hindcasts, the former method has a Brier skill score of 11-26ĝ€% against the latter for the probabilistic hydrological drought forecasting. In the Anthropocene, the skill for both approaches increases due to the dominant influence of human interventions that have been implicitly incorporated by the hydrological post-processing, while the difference between the two predictions decreases. This suggests that human interventions can outweigh the climate variability for the hydrological drought forecasting in the Anthropocene, and the predictability for human interventions needs more attention.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:56","2018-01-19 22:51:56","","5477-5492","","11","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Reservoir operation; climate variation; drought; streamflow; Climatology; climate modeling; Meteorological drought; Drought; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Groundwater; seasonal variation; Watersheds; Water supply; river basin; water use; Reservoirs (water); Hydrological forecasting; Anthropocene; Anthropogenic climate changes; Groundwater exploitation; Hydrological droughts; Model based approach; Seasonal forecasting; Yellow River Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the ways in which snowpacks are affected by forest canopy processes vary depending on climatic, topographic and forest characteristics. Here we present results from a 4-year study of snow-forest interactions in the Oregon Cascades. We continuously monitored snow and meteorological variables at paired forested and open sites at three elevations representing the Low, Mid, and High seasonal snow zones in the study region. On a monthly to bi-weekly basis, we surveyed snow depth and snow water equivalent across 900 m transects connecting the forested and open pairs of sites. Our results show that relative to nearby open areas, the dense, relatively warm forests at Low and Mid sites impede snow accumulation via canopy snow interception and increase sub-canopy snowpack energy inputs via longwave radiation. Compared with the Forest sites, snowpacks are deeper and last longer in the Open site at the Low and Mid sites (4-26 and 11-33 days, respectively). However, we see the opposite relationship at the relatively colder High sites, with the Forest site maintaining snow longer into the spring by 15-29 days relative to the nearby Open site. Canopy interception efficiency (CIE) values at the Low and Mid Forest sites averaged 79 and 76 % of the total event snowfall, whereas CIE was 31 % at the lower density High Forest site. At all elevations, longwave radiation in forested environments appears to be the primary energy component due to the maritime climate and forest presence, accounting for 93, 92, and 47 % of total energy inputs to the snowpack at the Low, Mid, and High Forest sites, respectively. Higher wind speeds in the High Open site significantly increase turbulent energy exchanges and snow sublimation. Lower wind speeds in the High Forest site create preferential snowfall deposition. These results show the importance of understanding the effects of forest cover on sub-canopy snowpack evolution and highlight the need for improved forest cover model representation to accurately predict water resources in maritime forests. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:51:59","2018-01-19 22:51:59","","5427-5442","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; United States; Water resources; forest canopy; snowpack; Wind; Forestry; Oregon; energy balance; forest cover; Snow melting systems; ablation; Ablation; Canopy interception; Cascade Range; elevation; Elevation gradient; Forested environment; interception; Long-wave radiation; longwave radiation; Meteorological variables; Model representation; mountain environment; snow accumulation; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; Turbulent energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, SFC estimates of the gauged donor catchments and subsequently the ungauged catchments can be substantially uncertain when models are calibrated using traditional approaches based on optimization of statistical performance metrics (e.g., Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency). An improved calibration strategy for gauged catchments is therefore crucial to help reduce the uncertainties of estimated SFCs for ungauged catchments. The aim of this study was to improve SFC estimates from modeled runoff time series in gauged catchments by explicitly including one or several SFCs in the calibration process. Different types of objective functions were defined consisting of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, single SFCs, or combinations thereof. We calibrated a bucket-type runoff model (HBV - Hydrologiska Byräns Vattenavdelning - model) for 25 catchments in the Tennessee River basin and evaluated the proposed calibration approach on 13 ecologically relevant SFCs representing major flow regime components and different flow conditions. While the model generally tended to underestimate the tested SFCs related to mean and high-flow conditions, SFCs related to low flow were generally overestimated. The highest estimation accuracies were achieved by a SFC-specific model calibration. Estimates of SFCs not included in the calibration process were of similar quality when comparing a multi-SFC calibration approach to a traditional model efficiency calibration. For practical applications, this implies that SFCs should preferably be estimated from targeted runoff model calibration, and modeled estimates need to be carefully interpreted. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:02","2018-01-19 22:52:02","","5443-5457","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrologic models; Runoff; Time series; United States; low flow; optimization; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; runoff; calibration; model validation; Catchments; Efficiency; time series; Objective functions; Statistical performance; Stream flow; Ungauged catchment; Calibration process; Cesium compounds; High flow conditions; Tennessee Basin; Traditional approaches; Traditional models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The multi-scale moving t test was applied to determine the onset and withdrawal of rainy season. Results showed that the precipitation anomaly can reach up to 30 % above average precipitation during decaying CPW and EPW phases. Developing EPW could cause decreasing precipitation over large areas in China with 10-30 % lower than average precipitation in most areas. Conventional El Niño in the developing phase had the largest influence on ENSO-related precipitation among developing ENSO and ENSO Modoki regimes. Decaying ENSO also showed a larger effect on precipitation anomalies, compared to decaying ENSO Modoki. The difference between rainy-season precipitation under various ENSO regimes may be attributed to the combined influence of anti-cyclone in the western North Pacific and the Indian monsoon. Stronger monsoon and anti-cyclone are associated with enhanced rainy-season precipitation. The results suggest a certain predictability of rainy-season precipitation related to ENSO regimes. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:04","2018-01-19 22:52:04","","5415-5426","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Southern oscillation; Climatology; monsoon; seasonal variation; Storms; Atmospheric thermodynamics; precipitation intensity; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Nickel; Precipitation anomalies; anticyclone; Atmospheric pressure; cooling; Eastern pacific; Indian monsoon; Onset and withdrawal of rainy seasons; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Phase precipitations; Rainy seasons; warming; Western North Pacific","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate the degree to which the field-scale water balance can be closed using only routine field observations in a seasonally frozen prairie pasture field site in Saskatchewan, Canada. Arrays of snow and soil moisture measurements were combined with a precipitation gauge and flux tower evapotranspiration estimates. We consider three hydrologically distinct periods: the snow accumulation period over the winter, the snowmelt period in spring, and the summer growing season. In each period, we attempt to quantify the residual between net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation) and the change in field-scale storage (snow and soil moisture), while accounting for measurement uncertainties. When the residual is negligible, a simple 1-D water balance with no net drainage is adequate. When the residual is non-negligible, we must find additional processes to explain the result. We identify the hydrological fluxes which confound the 1-D water balance assumptions during different periods of the year, notably blowing snow and frozen soil moisture redistribution during the snow accumulation period, and snowmelt runoff and soil drainage during the melt period. Challenges associated with quantifying these processes, as well as uncertainties in the measurable quantities, caution against the common use of water balance residuals to estimate fluxes and constrain models in such a complex environment.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:06","2018-01-19 22:52:06","","5401-5413","","11","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Snow; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; runoff; seasonal variation; Canada; Field observations; Soil moisture; Soils; precipitation (climatology); Soil surveys; soil drainage; water budget; raingauge; Moisture; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; pasture; snow accumulation; blowing snow; Complex environments; Frozen soils; Hydrological water balance; Measurement uncertainty; Meteorological instruments; prairie; Precipitation gauges; Saskatchewan; Snow accumulation; Soil moisture measurement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the potential of a 12-year quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) from a single weather radar is evaluated. For the period 2005-2016, 1 and 24 h rainfall extremes from automatic rain gauges and collocated radar estimates are compared. The peak intensities are fitted to the exponential distribution using regression in Q-Q plots with a threshold rank which minimises the mean squared error. A basic radar product used as reference exhibits unrealistic high extremes and is not suitable for extreme value analysis. For 24 h rainfall extremes, which occur partly in winter, the radar-based QPE needs a bias correction. A few missing events are caused by the wind drift associated with convective cells and strong radar signal attenuation. Differences between radar and gauge rainfall values are caused by spatial and temporal sampling, gauge underestimations and radar errors. Nonetheless the fit to the QPE data is within the confidence interval of the gauge fit, which remains large due to the short study period. A regional frequency analysis for 1 h duration is performed at the locations of four gauges with 1965-2008 records using the spatially independent QPE data in a circle of 20 km. The confidence interval of the radar fit, which is small due to the sample size, contains the gauge fit for the two closest stations from the radar. In Brussels, the radar extremes are significantly higher than the gauge rainfall extremes, but similar to those observed by an automatic gauge during the same period. The extreme statistics exhibit slight variations related to topography. The radar-based extreme value analysis can be extended to other durations. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:08","2018-01-19 22:52:08","","5385-5399","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Regional frequency analysis; rainfall; time series analysis; Extreme value analysis; radar; sampling bias; Precipitation (meteorology); extreme event; precipitation assessment; estimation method; Mean square error; Belgium; frequency analysis; Value engineering; Gages; raingauge; Rain gages; Brussels [Belgium]; confidence interval; Confidence interval; Exponential distributions; Extreme statistics; Mean squared error; Meteorological radar; Quantitative precipitation estimation; Radar; Radar stations; Temporal sampling; threshold","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The air temperature inside the cave is around 7g°C, with slight differences between the upper and lower parts of the main passage. CO2 concentrations in cave air have a seasonal signal, with summer minima and winter maxima. These might indicate the existence of an organic matter reservoir deep within the epikarst that continues to decompose over the winter, and CO2 concentrations are possibly modulated by seasonal differences in cave ventilation. The maximum values of CO2 show a rise after the summer of 2014, from around 2000 to about 3500gppm, following a rise in surface temperature. Using two newly designed types of water-air equilibrators, we were able to determine the concentration of CO2 dissolved in drip water by measuring its concentration in the equilibrator headspace and then using Henry's law to calculate its concentration in water. This method opens the possibility of continuous data logging using infrared technology, without the need for costly and less reliable chemical determinations. The local meteoric water line (/2Hg Combining double low line g7.7/18Og+g10.1), constructed using monthly aggregated rainfall samples, is similar to the global one, revealing the Atlantic as the strongly dominant vapor source. The deuterium excess values, as high as 17g, indicate that precipitation has an important evaporative component, possibly given by moisture recycling over the European continent. The variability of stable isotopes in drip water is similar at all points inside the cave, suggesting that the monitored drip sites are draining a homogenous reservoir. Drip rates, as well as stable isotopes, indicate that the transfer time of water from the surface is on the order of a few days. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:10","2018-01-19 22:52:10","","5357-5373","","10","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Romania; moisture; design method; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; precipitation (climatology); Reservoirs (water); Monitoring; Carbon dioxide; air temperature; Isotopes; stable isotope; karst; climate conditions; carbon dioxide; cave; Caves; Chemical determination; Climate information; deuterium; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental signals; Infrared radiation; Infrared technology; meteoric water; Meteoric water lines; organic matter; physicochemical property; Seasonal differences; signal; surface temperature; Surface temperatures; water vapor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The largest flood in history occurred in 1999 with a return period estimate of 200 years, considerably larger than the current capacity of the flood defense with a design return period of 50 years. Due to its flat saucer-like terrain, the capacity of the flood control system in this basin depends on flood control infrastructures and peripheral tidal conditions. The Huangpu River, an important river of the basin connecting Lake Taihu upstream and Yangtze River estuaries downstream, drains two-fifths of the entire basin. Since the water level in the Huangpu River is significantly affected by the high tide conditions in estuaries, constructing an estuary gate is considered an effective solution for flood mitigation. The main objective of this paper is to assess the potential contributions of the proposed Huangpu Gate to the flood control capacity of the basin. To achieve this goal, five different scenarios of flooding conditions and the associated gate operations are considered by using numerical model simulations. Results of quantitative analyses show that the Huangpu Gate is effective for evacuating floodwaters. It can help to reduce both peak values and duration of high water levels in Lake Taihu to benefit surrounding areas along the Taipu Canal and the Huangpu River. The contribution of the gate to the flood control capacity is closely associated with its operation modes and duration. For the maximum potential contribution of the gate, the net outflow at the proposed site is increased by 52g %. The daily peak level is decreased by a maximum of 0.12g m in Lake Taihu, by maxima of 0.26-0.37 and 0.46-0.60g m in the Taipu Canal and the Huangpu River, respectively, and by 0.05-0.39g m in the surrounding areas depending on the local topography.

In this research, consistency in stage-discharge data is investigated using a methodology called Bidirectional Reach (BReach), which departs from a (in operational hydrology) commonly used definition of consistency. A period is considered to be consistent if no consecutive and systematic deviations from a current situation occur that exceed observational uncertainty. Therefore, the capability of a rating curve model to describe a subset of the (chronologically sorted) data is assessed in each observation by indicating the outermost data points for which the rating curve model behaves satisfactorily. These points are called the maximum left or right reach, depending on the direction of the investigation. This temporal reach should not be confused with a spatial reach (indicating a part of a river). Changes in these reaches throughout the data series indicate possible changes in data consistency and if not resolved could introduce additional errors and biases. In this research, various measurement stations in the UK, New Zealand and Belgium are selected based on their significant historical ratings information and their specific characteristics related to data consistency. For each country, regional information is maximally used to estimate observational uncertainty. Based on this uncertainty, a BReach analysis is performed and, subsequently, results are validated against available knowledge about the history and behavior of the site. For all investigated cases, the methodology provides results that appear to be consistent with this knowledge of historical changes and thus facilitates a reliable assessment of (in)consistent periods in stage-discharge measurements. This assessment is not only useful for the analysis and determination of discharge time series, but also to enhance applications based on these data (e.g., by informing hydrological and hydraulic model evaluation design about consistent time periods to analyze). © 2017 Author(s).

Precipitation and temperature forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts served as inputs to a deterministic lumped hydrological (HBV) model. Due to a non-homogeneous bias in time, pre- and post-processing of the meteorological and streamflow forecasts are not effective. The best forecast skill, relative to alternative forecasts based on meteorological climatology, is shown for high streamflow and snow accumulation low-streamflow events. Forecasts of medium-streamflow events and low-streamflow events under precipitation deficit conditions show less skill. To improve performance of the forecasting system for high-streamflow events, the meteorological forecasts are most important. Besides, it is recommended that the hydrological model be calibrated specifically on low-streamflow conditions and high-streamflow conditions. Further, it is recommended that the dispersion (reliability) of the ensemble streamflow forecasts is enlarged by including the uncertainties in the hydrological model parameters and the initial conditions, and by enlarging the dispersion of the meteorological input forecasts. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:19","2018-01-19 22:52:19","","5273-5291","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Ensemble forecasting; Climate models; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric movements; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Stream flow; Precipitation deficits; Streamflow forecasting; Dispersions; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Hydrometeorological conditions; Meteorological input; Temperature forecasts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correlations between groundwater pressure change and event precipitation were observed at a co-located site near Duck Lake, SK, over a multi-year and multi-season period. Correlation coefficients (r2) varied from 0.99 for rainfall to 0.94 for snowfall. The geolysimeter was shown to underestimate rainfall by 7 % while overestimating snowfall by 9 % as compared to the unadjusted gauge precipitation. It is speculated that the underestimation of rainfall is due to unmeasured run-off and evapotranspiration within the response area of the geolysimeter during larger rainfall events, while the overestimation of snow is at least partially due to the systematic undercatch common to most precipitation gauges due to wind. Using recently developed transfer functions from the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), bias adjustments were applied to the Alter-shielded, Geonor T-200B precipitation gauge measurements of snowfall to mitigate wind-induced errors. The bias between the gauge and geolysimeter measurements was reduced to 3 %. This suggests that the geolysimeter is capable of accurately measuring solid precipitation and can be used as an independent and representative reference of true precipitation. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:22","2018-01-19 22:52:22","","5263-5272","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Snow; evapotranspiration; groundwater; lysimeter; Groundwater; Canada; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); Gages; raingauge; Meteorological instruments; Precipitation gauges; Saskatchewan; Conventional precipitation; Correlation coefficient; Groundwater pressure; measurement method; Precipitation events; Precipitation gauge measurement; snow; Solid precipitation; World meteorological organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this paper is to understand the LULCC in the Dinder and Rahad and its implications on streamflow response using satellite data and hydrological modelling. The hydrological model has been derived by different sets of land use and land cover maps from 1972, 1986, 1998 and 2011. Catchment topography, land cover and soil maps are derived from satellite images and serve to estimate model parameters. Results of LULCC detection between 1972 and 2011 indicate a significant decrease in woodland and an increase in cropland. Woodland decreased from 42 to 14 % and from 35 to 14 % for Dinder and Rahad, respectively. Cropland increased from 14 to 47 % and from 18 to 68 % in Dinder and Rahad, respectively. The model results indicate that streamflow is affected by LULCC in both the Dinder and the Rahad rivers. The effect of LULCC on streamflow is significant during 1986 and 2011. This could be attributed to the severe drought during the mid-1980s and the recent large expansion in cropland. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:24","2018-01-19 22:52:24","","5217-5242","","10","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; drought; hydrology; satellite data; streamflow; land cover; water management; Ethiopia; hydrological modeling; Land use; water resource; Satellites; Land use and land cover change; Catchments; flow measurement; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological modelling; environmental impact assessment; hydrological response; land use change; agricultural land; Stream flow; map; Land use and land cover; woodland; Blue Nile Basin; Catchment topography; Dinder Basin; Management and utilization; Nile Basin; soil analysis; Streamflow response; Sudan; Surface hydrology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among them, operational hydrology and numerical weather prediction, for instance, need SM information in near-real-time (NRT), typically not later than 3 h after sensing. The European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is the first mission specifically designed to measure SM from space. The ESA Level 2 SM retrieval algorithm is based on a detailed geophysical modelling and cannot provide SM in NRT. This paper presents the new ESA SMOS NRT SM product. It uses a neural network (NN) to provide SM in NRT. The NN inputs are SMOS brightness temperatures for horizontal and vertical polarizations and incidence angles from 30 to 45°. In addition, the NN uses surface soil temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The NN was trained on SMOS Level 2 (L2) SM. The swath of the NRT SM retrieval is somewhat narrower (∼915 km) than that of the L2 SM dataset (∼1150 km), which implies a slightly lower revisit time. The new SMOS NRT SM product was compared to the SMOS Level 2 SM product. The NRT SM data show a standard deviation of the difference with respect to the L2 data of < 0.05 m3 m-3 in most of the Earth and a Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.7 in large regions of the globe. The NRT SM dataset does not show a global bias with respect to the L2 dataset but can show local biases of up to 0.05 m3 m-3 in absolute value. The two SMOS SM products were evaluated against in situ measurements of SM from more than 120 sites of the SCAN (Soil Climate Analysis Network) and the USCRN (US Climate Reference Network) networks in North America. The NRT dataset obtains similar but slightly better results than the L2 data. In summary, the NN SMOS NRT SM product exhibits performances similar to those of the Level 2 SM product but it has the advantage of being available in less than 3.5 h after sensing, complying with NRT requirements. The new product is processed at ECMWF and it is distributed by ESA and via the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) multicast service (EUMETCast).","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:26","2018-01-19 22:52:26","","5201-5216","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Numerical weather prediction; Temperature; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Soil moisture; Soils; Soil surveys; Moisture; Operational hydrologies; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Correlation methods; Horizontal and vertical polarizations; Pearson correlation coefficients; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Surface soil temperatures; Us climate reference networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hillslopes are the essential interface for water movement in catchments. The shallow subsurface on slopes typically consists of different layers with varying characteristics. The aim of this study was to draw conclusions about the infiltration behaviour, to identify water flow pathways and derive some general interpretations for the validity of the water movement on a hillslope with periglacial slope deposits (cover beds), where the layers differ in their sedimentological and hydrological properties. Especially the described varying influence of the basal layer (LB) as an impeding layer on the one hand and as a remarkable pathway for rapid subsurface stormflow on the other. We used a time lapse 3-D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) approach combined with punctual hydrometric data to trace the spreading and the progression of an irrigation plume in layered slope deposits during two irrigation experiments. This multi-Technical approach enables us to connect the high spatial resolution of the 3-D ERT with the high temporal resolution of the hydrometric devices. Infiltration through the uppermost layer was dominated by preferential flow, whereas the water flow in the deeper layers was mainly matrix flow. Subsurface stormflow due to impeding characteristic of the underlying layer occurs in form of <q>organic layer interflow</q> and at the interface to the first basal layer (LB1). However, the main driving factor for subsurface stormflow is the formation of a capillary barrier at the interface to the second basal layer (LB2). The capillary barrier prevents water from entering the deeper layer under unsaturated conditions and diverts the seepage water according to the slope inclination. With higher saturation, the capillary barrier breaks down and water reaches the highly conductive deeper layer. This highlights the importance of the capillary barrier effect for the prevention or activation of different flow pathways under variable hydrological conditions.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:29","2018-01-19 22:52:29","","5181-5199","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","catchment; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; seepage; Hydraulics; water flow; Catchments; Flow of water; Storms; Irrigation; slope angle; hillslope; Hydrological condition; spatial resolution; Infiltration; High temporal resolution; capillarity; Capillary barrier effect; Deposits; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; High spatial resolution; Hydrological properties; Hydrometric measurements; hydrometry; Periglacial slope deposits; Seepage; tomography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This need is further emphasized in arid climates, where rainfall is scarce and highly variable. In this study, 24 years of corrected and gaugeadjusted radar rainfall estimates are used to (i) identify the spatial structure and dynamics of convective rain cells in a dry climate region in the Eastern Mediterranean, (ii) to determine their climatology, and (iii) to understand their relation with the governing synoptic systems and with flashflood generation. Rain cells are extracted using a segmentation method and a tracking algorithm, and are clustered into three synoptic patterns according to atmospheric variables from the ERA-Interim reanalysis. On average, the cells are about 90 km2 in size, move 13ms-1 from west to east, and live for 18 min. The Cyprus low accounts for 30% of the events, the low to the east of the study region for 44 %, and the Active Red Sea Trough for 26 %. The Active Red Sea Trough produces shorter rain events composed of rain cells with higher rain intensities, longer lifetime, smaller area, and lower velocities. The area of rain cells is positively correlated with topographic height. The number of cells is negatively correlated with the distance from the shoreline. Rain-cell intensity is negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation. Flash-flood-related events are dominated by rain cells of large size, low velocity, and long lifetime that move downstream with the main axis of the catchments. These results can be further used for stochastic simulations of convective rain storms and serve as input for hydrological models and for flash-flood nowcasting systems. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:31","2018-01-19 22:52:31","","5165-5180","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; algorithm; climatology; rainfall; radar; Mediterranean Sea; Floods; runoff; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; flash flood; Cytology; precipitation (climatology); arid region; Stochastic simulations; Indian Ocean; arid environment; Atmospheric variables; convection; Convective rain cells; Cyprus; Dead Sea; Eastern Mediterranean; High-resolution measurements; Mean annual precipitation; Mediterranean Sea (East); nowcasting; rainstorm; Red Sea [Indian Ocean]; segmentation; Segmentation methods; Spatiotemporal patterns; synoptic meteorology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of snowmelt on the water balance can be critical to sustain agriculture activities, hydropower generation, urban water supplies and wildlife. In Chile, 25ĝ€% of the territory between the region of Valparaiso and Araucanía comprises areas where snow precipitation occurs. As in many other difficult-To-Access regions of the world, there is a lack of hydrological data of the Chilean Andes related to discharge, snow courses, and snow depths, which complicates the analysis of important hydrological processes (e.g. water availability). Remote sensing provides a promising opportunity to enhance the assessment and monitoring of the spatial and temporal variability of snow characteristics, such as the snow cover area (SCA) and snow cover dynamic (SCD). With regards to the foregoing questions, the objective of the study is to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the SCA at five watersheds (Aconcagua, Rapel, Maule, Biobío and Toltén) located in the Chilean Andes, between latitude 32.0 and 39.5°ĝ€S, and to analyse its relationship with the precipitation regime/pattern and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Those watersheds were chosen because of their importance in terms of their number of inhabitants, and economic activities depending on water resources. The SCA area was obtained from MOD10A2 for the period 2000-2016, and the SCD was analysed through a number of statistical tests to explore observed trends. In order to verify the SCA for trend analysis, a validation of the MOD10A2 product was done, consisting of the comparison of snow presence predicted by MODIS with ground observations. Results indicate that there is an overall agreement of 81 to 98ĝ€% between SCA determined from ground observations and MOD10A2, showing that the MODIS snow product can be taken as a feasible remote sensing tool for SCA estimation in southern-central Chile. Regarding SCD, no significant reduction in SCA for the period 2000-2016 was detected, with the exception of the Aconcagua and Rapel watersheds. In addition to that, an important decline in SCA in the five watersheds for the period of 2012 and 2016 was also evident, which is coincidental with the rainfall deficit for the same years. Findings were compared against ENSO episodes that occurred during 2010-2016, detecting that Niña years are coincident with maximum SCA during winter in all watersheds.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:33","2018-01-19 22:52:33","","5111-5126","","10","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; Southern oscillation; Water resources; Climatology; Economics; Watersheds; Water supply; Remote sensing; Hydrological process; Snow melting systems; Precipitation regimes; Nickel; Spatial and temporal variability; Atmospheric pressure; Assessment and monitoring; Hydro-power generation; Radiometers; Remote sensing tools; Spatio-temporal dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationship between CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been investigated, and this significant relationship lays the foundation for the estimation of DOC using remotely sensed imagery data. The current study examined samples from freshwater lakes, saline lakes, rivers and streams, urban water bodies, and ice-covered lakes in China for tracking the variation of the relationships between DOC and CDOM. The regression model slopes for DOC vs. aCDOM (275) ranged from extremely low 0.33 (highly saline lakes) to 1.03 (urban waters) and 3.01 (river waters). The low values were observed in saline lake waters and waters from semi-Arid or arid regions, where strong photobleaching is expected due to less cloud cover, longer water residence time, and daylight hours. In contrast, high values were found in waters developed in wetlands or forest in Northeast China, where more organic matter was transported from catchment to waters. The study also demonstrated that closer relationships between CDOM and DOC were revealed when aCDOM (275) were sorted by the ratio of aCDOM.250/=aCDOM (365), which is a measure for the CDOM absorption with respect to its composition, and the determination of coefficient of the regression models ranged from 0.79 to 0.98 for different groups of waters. Our results indicate the relationships between CDOM and DOC are variable for different inland waters; thus, models for DOC estimation through linking with CDOM absorption need to be tailored according to water types.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:35","2018-01-19 22:52:35","","5127-5141","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Regression analysis; Ecology; Rivers; aquatic ecosystem; Aquatic ecosystems; Catchments; river basin; lake water; Lakes; Carbon; Biogeochemistry; Organic carbon; semiarid region; arid region; stream; biogeochemical cycle; Saline water; wetland; Biogeochemical cycle; Biological materials; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; Fresh water lakes; ice cover; lacustrine environment; Organic compounds; Photobleaching; Remotely sensed imagery; Rivers and streams; saline lake; Urban water bodies; Water absorption; Water residence time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigate four large (23 000-69 000 km2) Midwest river basins that span climate and land use gradients to understand how climate and agricultural drainage have influenced basin hydrology over the last 79 years. We use daily, monthly, and annual flow metrics to document streamflow changes and discuss those changes in the context of precipitation and land use changes. Since 1935, flow, precipitation, artificial drainage extent, and corn and soybean acreage have increased across the region. In extensively drained basins, we observe 2 to 4 fold increases in low flows and 1.5 to 3 fold increases in high and extreme flows. Using a water budget, we determined that the storage term has decreased in intensively drained and cultivated basins by 30-200 % since 1975, but increased by roughly 30 % in the less agricultural basin. Storage has generally decreased during spring and summer months and increased during fall and winter months in all watersheds. Thus, the loss of storage and enhanced hydrologic connectivity and efficiency imparted by artificial agricultural drainage appear to have amplified the streamflow response to precipitation increases in the Midwest. Future increases in precipitation are likely to further intensify drainage practices and increase streamflows. Increased streamflow has implications for flood risk, channel adjustment, and sediment and nutrient transport and presents unique challenges for agriculture and water resource management in the Midwest. Better documentation of existing and future drain tile and ditch installation is needed to further understand the role of climate versus drainage across multiple spatial and temporal scales.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:38","2018-01-19 22:52:38","","5065-5088","","10","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Water resources; connectivity; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; climate change; Floods; flooding; Land use; Agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; Watersheds; Catchments; Budget control; drainage network; Hydrology; river basin; precipitation (climatology); Zea mays; land use change; Waterresource management; Stream flow; river channel; Streamflow changes; Streamflow response; Agricultural drainage; Glycine max; Hydrologic connectivity; Midwest; Nutrient transport; Row-crop agriculture; Spatial and temporal scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sensor provides continuous soil moisture data, averaged over several hectares and tens of decimeters in depth. However, the signal still may contain unidentified features of hydrological processes, and many calibration datasets are often required in order to find reliable relations between neutron intensity and water dynamics. Recent insights into environmental neutrons accurately described the spatial sensitivity of the sensor and thus allowed one to quantify the contribution of individual sample locations to the CRNS signal. Consequently, data points of calibration and validation datasets are suggested to be averaged using a more physically based weighting approach. In this work, a revised sensitivity function is used to calculate weighted averages of point data. The function is different from the simple exponential convention by the extraordinary sensitivity to the first few meters around the probe, and by dependencies on air pressure, air humidity, soil moisture, and vegetation. The approach is extensively tested at six distinct monitoring sites: two sites with multiple calibration datasets and four sites with continuous time series datasets. In all cases, the revised averaging method improved the performance of the CRNS products. The revised approach further helped to reveal hidden hydrological processes which otherwise remained unexplained in the data or were lost in the process of overcalibration. The presented weighting approach increases the overall accuracy of CRNS products and will have an impact on all their applications in agriculture, hydrology, and modeling. © Authors 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:40","2018-01-19 22:52:40","","5009-5030","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; performance assessment; soil moisture; spatial analysis; sensitivity analysis; water content; calibration; model validation; accuracy assessment; sensor; sampling; Soil moisture; soil water; Hydrological process; Calibration and validations; Moisture; cosmic ray; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Continuous time systems; Cosmic ray neutron; light; Multiple calibration; Neutron intensities; Neutrons; Sensitivity functions; soil depth; Spatial sensitivity; Weighting approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantifying LGD and its spatial patterns is challenging because of the large spatial extent of the aquifer-lake interface and pronounced spatial variability. This is the first experimental study to specifically study these larger-scale patterns with sufficient spatial resolution to systematically investigate how landscape and local characteristics affect the spatial variability in LGD. We measured vertical temperature profiles around a 0.49ĝ€km2 lake in northeastern Germany with a needle thermistor, which has the advantage of allowing for rapid (manual) measurements and thus, when used in a survey, high spatial coverage and resolution. Groundwater inflow rates were then estimated using the heat transport equation. These near-shore temperature profiles were complemented with sediment temperature measurements with a fibre-optic cable along six transects from shoreline to shoreline and radon measurements of lake water samples to qualitatively identify LGD patterns in the offshore part of the lake. As the hydrogeology of the catchment is sufficiently homogeneous (sandy sediments of a glacial outwash plain; no bedrock control) to avoid patterns being dominated by geological discontinuities, we were able to test the common assumptions that spatial patterns of LGD are mainly controlled by sediment characteristics and the groundwater flow field. We also tested the assumption that topographic gradients can be used as a proxy for gradients of the groundwater flow field. Thanks to the extensive data set, these tests could be carried out in a nested design, considering both small- and large-scale variability in LGD. We found that LGD was concentrated in the near-shore area, but alongshore variability was high, with specific regions of higher rates and higher spatial variability. Median inflow rates were 44ĝ€Lĝ€†mĝ'2ĝ€†dĝ'1 with maximum rates in certain locations going up to 169ĝ€Lĝ€†mĝ'2ĝ€†dĝ'1. Offshore LGD was negligible except for two local hotspots on steep steps in the lake bed topography. Large-scale groundwater inflow patterns were correlated with topography and the groundwater flow field, whereas small-scale patterns correlated with grain size distributions of the lake sediment. These findings confirm results and assumptions of theoretical and modelling studies more systematically than was previously possible with coarser sampling designs. However, we also found that a significant fraction of the variance in LGD could not be explained by these controls alone and that additional processes need to be considered. While regression models using these controls as explanatory variables had limited power to predict LGD rates, the results nevertheless encourage the use of topographic indices and sediment heterogeneity as an aid for targeted campaigns in future studies of groundwater discharge to lakes, ©Authors 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:42","2018-01-19 22:52:42","","5043-5063","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Regression analysis; Water quality; discharge; groundwater; Hydrogeology; water quality; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; Sediments; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Catchments; groundwater flow; spatial variation; lake water; Lakes; Ground water discharge; inflow; bedrock; groundwater-surface water interaction; Coastal engineering; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Explanatory variables; Flow fields; grain size; Grain size and shape; Grain size distribution; Heat transport equation; lacustrine deposit; Local characteristics; Sediment characteristic; Statistical tests; Temperature control; Temperature measurement; Topographic gradients; Vertical temperature profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantitative monitoring of DSR is of great importance to assess water resources and to study water balance in arid and semi-arid regions. This study used a typical bare land on the eastern margin of Mu Us Sandy Land in the Ordos Basin of China as an example to illustrate a new lysimeter method of measuring DSR to examine if the annual recharge coefficient is valid or not in the study site, where the annual recharge efficient is the ratio of annual DSR over annual total precipitation. Positioning monitoring was done on precipitation and DSR measurements underneath mobile sand dunes from 2013 to 2015 in the study area. Results showed that use of an annual recharge coefficient for estimating DSR in bare sand land in arid and semi-arid regions is questionable and could lead to considerable errors. It appeared that DSR in those regions was influenced by precipitation pattern and was closely correlated with spontaneous strong precipitation events (with precipitation greater than 10ĝ€mm) other than the total precipitation. This study showed that as much as 42ĝ€% of precipitation in a single strong precipitation event can be transformed into DSR. During the observation period, the maximum annual DSR could make up 24.33ĝ€% of the annual precipitation. This study provided a reliable method of estimating DSR in sandy areas of arid and semi-arid regions, which is valuable for managing groundwater resources and ecological restoration in those regions. It also provided strong evidence that the annual recharge coefficient was invalid for calculating DSR in arid and semi-arid regions.

Specifically, we investigate the influences of different reference periods on historical drought characteristics, such as the trend, frequency, intensity and spatial extent, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with a 12-month lag (SPEI-12), which was estimated from the datasets of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and the University of Delaware (UDEL). For the 1901-1957 (P1) and 1958-2014 (P2) estimation periods, three different types of reference periods are used to compute the SPEI: P1 and P2 together, P1 and P2 separately and P1 only. Focusing on East Asia, Europe, the United States and West Africa, we find that the influence of the reference period is significant in East Asia and West Africa, with dominant drying trends from P1 to P2. The reference period influenced the assessment of drought characteristics, particularly the severity and spatial extent, whereas the influence on the frequency was relatively small. Finally, self-calibration, which is the most common practice for indices such as the SPEI, tends to underestimate the drought severity and spatial extent relative to the other approaches used in this study. Although the conclusions drawn in this study are limited by the use of two global datasets, they highlight the need for clarification of the reference period in drought assessments to better understand regional drought characteristics and the associated temporal changes, particularly under climate change scenarios, ©Authors 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:47","2018-01-19 22:52:47","","4989-5007","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Climate change; Climate change scenarios; Drought severity; Europe; United States; drought; evapotranspiration; data set; trend analysis; Drought characteristics; Drought indices; climate change; West Africa; Drought; computer simulation; calibration; temporal variation; precipitation assessment; estimation method; standard (regulation); index method; Calibration periods; Climate research; Far East; Self calibration; University of Delaware","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a river network modeled with several Strahler orders of tributaries, comprehensive and consistent synoptic data are typically lacking and synthetic starting conditions are needed. Because of underlying nonlinearity, poorly defined or inconsistent initial conditions can lead to convergence problems and long spin-up times in an unsteady solver. Two new approaches are defined and demonstrated herein for computing flows and cross-sectional areas (or depths). These methods can produce an initial condition data set that is consistent with modeled landscape runoff and river geometry boundary conditions at the initial time. These new methods are (1) the pseudo time-marching method (PTM) that iterates toward a steady-state initial condition using an unsteady Saint-Venant solver and (2) the steady-solution method (SSM) that makes use of graph theory for initial flow rates and solution of a steady-state 1-D momentum equation for the channel cross-sectional areas. The PTM is shown to be adequate for short river reaches but is significantly slower and has occasional non-convergent behavior for large river networks. The SSM approach is shown to provide a rapid solution of consistent initial conditions for both small and large networks, albeit with the requirement that additional code must be written rather than applying an existing unsteady Saint-Venant solver. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:49","2018-01-19 22:52:49","","4959-4972","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","data set; Rivers; hydrological modeling; runoff; numerical method; hydrodynamics; Computation theory; river system; boundary condition; Flow graphs; Graph theory; Initial conditions; Computing flows; Control nonlinearities; Convergence problems; Convergent behavior; Cross sectional area; Equations of state; Momentum equation; Saint Venant equation; Steady solution; tributary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding storage and transport of liquid water in natural snowpacks is crucial, especially for forecasting of natural hazards such as floods and wet snow avalanches. In this study, propagation of rainwater through snow was investigated by sprinkling experiments with deuterium-enriched water and applying an alternative hydrograph separation technique on samples collected from the snowpack runoff. This allowed us to quantify the contribution of rainwater, snowmelt and initial liquid water released from the snowpack. Four field experiments were carried out during winter 2015 in the vicinity of Davos, Switzerland. Blocks of natural snow were isolated from the surrounding snowpack to inhibit lateral exchange of water and were exposed to artificial rainfall using deuterium-enriched water. The experiments were composed of four 30 min periods of sprinkling, separated by three 30 min breaks. The snowpack runoff was continuously gauged and sampled periodically for the deuterium signature. At the onset of each experiment antecedent liquid water was first pushed out by the sprinkling water. Hydrographs showed four pronounced peaks corresponding to the four sprinkling bursts. The contribution of rainwater to snowpack runoff consistently increased over the course of the experiment but never exceeded 86 %. An experiment conducted on a non-ripe snowpack suggested the development of preferential flow paths that allowed rainwater to efficiently propagate through the snowpack limiting the time for mass exchange processes to take effect. In contrast, experiments conducted on ripe isothermal snowpack showed a slower response behaviour and resulted in a total runoff volume which consisted of less than 50% of the rain input. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:52","2018-01-19 22:52:52","","4973-4987","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Snow; rainfall; snowpack; Groundwater flow; preferential flow; Preferential flows; hydrograph; Field experiment; quantitative analysis; experiment; Switzerland; snowmelt; Liquids; Artificial rainfall; Avalanches (snowslides); Davos; Deuterium; Graubunden; Hydrograph separation; Mass-exchange process; Response behaviour; Runoff generation; Runoff volumes; snow avalanche","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we evaluate the usefulness and applicability of four different data assimilation methods for joint parameter and state estimation of the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model (VIC-3L) and the Community Land Model (CLM) using a 5-month calibration (assimilation) period (March-July 2012) of areal-averaged SPADE soil moisture measurements at 5, 20, and 50ĝ€cm depths in the Rollesbroich experimental test site in the Eifel mountain range in western Germany. We used the EnKF with state augmentation or dual estimation, respectively, and the residual resampling PF with a simple, statistically deficient, or more sophisticated, MCMC-based parameter resampling method. The performance of the <q>calibrated</q> LSM models was investigated using SPADE water content measurements of a 5-month evaluation period (August-December 2012). As expected, all DA methods enhance the ability of the VIC and CLM models to describe spatiotemporal patterns of moisture storage within the vadose zone of the Rollesbroich site, particularly if the maximum baseflow velocity (VIC) or fractions of sand, clay, and organic matter of each layer (CLM) are estimated jointly with the model states of each soil layer. The differences between the soil moisture simulations of VIC-3L and CLM are much larger than the discrepancies among the four data assimilation methods. The EnKF with state augmentation or dual estimation yields the best performance of VIC-3L and CLM during the calibration and evaluation period, yet results are in close agreement with the PF using MCMC resampling. Overall, CLM demonstrated the best performance for the Rollesbroich site.

Stream levels are easier to measure than streamflow and are likely also observed more easily by citizen scientists than streamflow. However, the challenge with crowd based stream level data is that observations are taken at irregular time intervals and with a limited vertical resolution. The latter is especially the case at sites where no staff gauge is available and relative stream levels are observed based on (in)visible features in the stream, such as rocks. In order to assess the potential value of crowd based stream level observations for model calibration, we pretended that stream level observations were available at a limited vertical resolution by transferring streamflow data to stream level classes. A bucket-type hydrological model was calibrated with these hypothetical stream level class data and subsequently evaluated on the observed streamflow records. Our results indicate that stream level data can result in good streamflow simulations, even with a reduced vertical resolution of the observations. Time series of only two stream level classes, e.g. above or below a rock in the stream, were already informative, especially when the class boundary was chosen towards the highest stream levels. There was some added value in using up to five stream level classes, but there was hardly any improvement in model performance when using more level classes. These results are encouraging for citizen science projects and provide a basis for designing observation systems that collect data that are as informative as possible for deriving model based streamflow time series for previously ungauged basins. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:56","2018-01-19 22:52:56","","4895-4905","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; gauge; performance assessment; simulation; streamflow; hydrological modeling; Model calibration; Climate models; calibration; spatial distribution; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; time series; Stream flow; Hydrological model calibrations; Information contents; Observation systems; Streamflow records; Streamflow simulations; tide gauge; Vertical resolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More precisely, the aim is to develop a robust implementation methodology to perform reliable streamflow simulations with a distributed model over large and partly ungauged basins, in an efficient manner. The latest version of GEM-Hydro combines the SVS (Soil, Vegetation and Snow) land-surface scheme and the WATROUTE routing scheme. SVS has never been evaluated from a hydrological point of view, which is done here for all major rivers flowing into Lake Ontario. Two established hydrological models are confronted to GEM-Hydro, namely MESH and WATFLOOD, which share the same routing scheme (WATROUTE) but rely on different land-surface schemes. All models are calibrated using the same meteorological forcings, objective function, calibration algorithm, and basin delineation. GEM-Hydro is shown to be competitive with MESH and WATFLOOD: the NSE √ (Nash-Sutcliffe criterion computed on the square root of the flows) is for example equal to 0.83 for MESH and GEM-Hydro in validation on the Moira River basin, and to 0.68 for WATFLOOD. A computationally efficient strategy is proposed to calibrate SVS: a simple unit hydrograph is used for routing instead of WATROUTE. Global and local calibration strategies are compared in order to estimate runoff for ungauged portions of the Lake Ontario basin. Overall, streamflow predictions obtained using a global calibration strategy, in which a single parameter set is identified for the whole basin of Lake Ontario, show accuracy comparable to the predictions based on local calibration: the average NSE √ in validation and over seven subbasins is 0.73 and 0.61, respectively for local and global calibrations. Hence, global calibration provides spatially consistent parameter values, robust performance at gauged locations, and reduces the complexity and computation burden of the calibration procedure. This work contributes to the Great Lakes Runoff Inter-comparison Project for Lake Ontario (GRIP-O), which aims at improving Lake Ontario basin runoff simulations by comparing different models using the same input forcings. The main outcome of this study consists in a new generalizable methodology for implementing a distributed hydrologic model with a high computation cost in an efficient and reliable manner, over a large area with ungauged portions, using global calibration and a unit hydrograph to replace the routing component. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:52:58","2018-01-19 22:52:58","","4825-4839","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Climate change; Runoff; prediction; streamflow; climate change; Streamflow prediction; hydrological modeling; computer simulation; Surface measurement; Forecasting; runoff; calibration; model validation; river basin; Great Lakes [North America]; Lakes; complexity; Mesh generation; Hydrological prediction; Stream flow; Streamflow simulations; Calibration algorithm; Calibration procedure; Computationally efficient; Distributed hydrologic model; Implementation methodology; Lake Ontario; Moira; Network routing; precision; Routing protocols; unit hydrograph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whilst this creates new opportunities for improving the performance of water resources systems, there may also be associated risks. Here, we explore these potential risks by examining the sensitivity of forecast value (improvement in system performance brought about by adopting forecasts) to changes in the forecast skill for a range of hypothetical reservoir designs with contrasting operating objectives. Forecast-informed operations are simulated using rolling horizon, adaptive control and then benchmarked against optimised control rules to assess performance improvements. Results show that there exists a strong relationship between forecast skill and value for systems operated to maintain a target water level. But this relationship breaks down when the reservoir is operated to satisfy a target demand for water; good forecast accuracy does not necessarily translate into performance improvement. We show that the primary cause of this behaviour is the buffering role played by storage in water supply reservoirs, which renders the forecast superfluous for long periods of the operation. System performance depends primarily on forecast accuracy when critical decisions are made-namely during severe drought. As it is not possible to know in advance if a forecast will perform well at such moments, we advocate measuring the consistency of forecast performance, through bootstrap resampling, to indicate potential usefulness in storage operations. Our results highlight the need for sensitivity assessment in value-of-forecast studies involving reservoirs with supply objectives. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:00","2018-01-19 22:53:00","","4841-4859","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Reservoir operation; Streamflow forecast; Water resources; design; performance assessment; reservoir; streamflow; water supply; bootstrapping; Forecasting; seasonal variation; Water supply; Water levels; forecasting method; benchmarking; complexity; Complex relationships; Reservoirs (water); Water resources systems; Stream flow; Bootstrap resampling; buffering; Forecast performance; Storage operations; Water supply reservoirs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, being difficult to measure, this parameter is usually uncertain. This study assesses the feasibility of using a 15-year (1999-2013) time series of satellite-derived low-resolution observations of leaf area index (LAI) to estimate MaxAWC for rainfed croplands over France. LAI interannual variability is simulated using the CO2-responsive version of the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) LSM for various values of MaxAWC. Optimal value is then selected by using (1) a simple inverse modelling technique, comparing simulated and observed LAI and (2) a more complex method consisting in integrating observed LAI in ISBA through a land data assimilation system (LDAS) and minimising LAI analysis increments. The evaluation of the MaxAWC estimates from both methods is done using simulated annual maximum above-ground biomass (Bag) and straw cereal grain yield (GY) values from the Agreste French agricultural statistics portal, for 45 administrative units presenting a high proportion of straw cereals. Significant correlations (p valueg 0.01) between Bag and GY are found for up to 36 and 53% of the administrative units for the inverse modelling and LDAS tuning methods, respectively. It is found that the LDAS tuning experiment gives more realistic values of MaxAWC and maximum Bag than the inverse modelling experiment. Using undisaggregated LAI observations leads to an underestimation of MaxAWC and maximum Bag in both experiments. Median annual maximum values of disaggregated LAI observations are found to correlate very well with MaxAWC. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:03","2018-01-19 22:53:03","","4861-4878","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Land data assimilation systems; Rain; drought; optimization; land surface; time series analysis; data assimilation; Uncertainty analysis; parameterization; water content; experimental study; France; crop yield; soil water; agricultural land; annual variation; Interannual variability; leaf area index; Above ground biomass; aboveground biomass; Available water contents; Complex methods; feasibility study; inverse analysis; Inverse modelling; Inverse problems; Land surface models; Parameter optimisation; rainfed agriculture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In light of the potential changes to the production and delivery of DOC and nitrate to rivers arising from climate change and land use management, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of hydrological controls on DOC and nitrate dynamics in such catchments. We measured DOC and nitrate concentrations in river water of six reaches of the lowland river Hampshire Avon (Wiltshire, southern UK) in order to quantify the relationship between BFI (BFI) and DOC: Nitrate molar ratios across contrasting geologies (Chalk, Greensand, and clay). We found a significant positive relationship between nitrate and BFI (p < 0:0001), and a significant negative relationship between DOC and BFI (p < 0:0001), resulting in a non-linear negative correlation between DOC: Nitrate molar ratio and BFI. In the Hampshire Avon, headwater reaches which are underlain by clay and characterized by a more flashy hydrological regime are associated with DOC: Nitrate ratios >5 throughout the year, whilst groundwater-dominated reaches underlain by Chalk, with a high BFI have DOC: Nitrate ratios in surface waters that are an order of magnitude lower (<0.5). Our analysis also reveals significant seasonal variations in DOC: Nitrate transport and highlights critical periods of nitrate export (e.g. winter in sub-catchments underlain by Chalk and Greensand, and autumn in drained, clay subcatchments) when DOC: Nitrate molar ratios are low, suggesting low potential for in-stream uptake of inorganic forms of nitrogen. Consequently, our study emphasizes the tight relationship between DOC and nitrate availability in agricultural catchments, and further reveals that this relationship is controlled to a great extent by the hydrological setting. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:08","2018-01-19 22:53:08","","4785-4802","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Runoff; United Kingdom; climate change; Rivers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Land use; nitrate; Nitrate concentration; Agriculture; stoichiometry; nitrogen; Nitrogen; Catchments; Carbon; Nitrates; Organic carbon; nutrient dynamics; agricultural catchment; lowland environment; England; Agricultural catchments; hydrological regime; Agricultural landscapes; dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; Hampshire; headwater; Hydrological controls; Hydrological regime; Limestone; Negative correlation; Resource stoichiometries; Sandstone; Wiltshire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explored the role of permafrost in controlling groundwater flow and the hydrological connections between glaciers in high mountains and rivers in the low piedmont plain with respect to hydraulic head, temperature, geochemical and isotopic data, at a representative catchment in the headwater region of the Heihe River, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results show that the groundwater in the high mountains mainly occurred as suprapermafrost groundwater, while in the moraine and fluvioglacial deposits on the planation surfaces of higher hills, suprapermafrost, intrapermafrost and subpermafrost groundwater cooccurred. Glacier and snow meltwaters were transported from the high mountains to the plain through stream channels, slope surfaces, and supra- A nd subpermafrost aquifers. Groundwater in the Quaternary aquifer in the piedmont plain was recharged by the lateral inflow from permafrost areas and the stream infiltration and was discharged as baseflow to the stream in the north. Groundwater maintained streamflow over the cold season and significantly contributed to the streamflow during the warm season. Two mechanisms were proposed to contribute to the seasonal variation of aquifer water-conduction capacity: (1) surface drainage through the stream channel during the warm period and (2) subsurface drainage to an artesian aquifer confined by stream icing and seasonal frost during the cold season. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:10","2018-01-19 22:53:10","","4803-4823","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; connectivity; hydrological cycle; streamflow; Hydrogeology; Rivers; Groundwater flow; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; seasonal variation; infiltration; Catchments; groundwater flow; Landforms; recharge; Stream flow; Hydrological cycles; baseflow; groundwater-surface water interaction; mountain region; Gansu; Hei River; Hydraulic heads; Hydrological connectivity; moraine; permafrost; Permafrost; piedmont; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Quaternary aquifers; Seasonal variation; stream channel; Subsurface drainages; Surface drainage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not financially or logistically feasible to monitor all rivers and the transferability of such models has not been explored. This paper uses Tw data from four river catchments collected in August 2015 to assess how well spatial regression models predict the maximum 7-day rolling mean of daily maximum Tw (Twmax / within and between catchments. Models were fitted for each catchment separately using (1) landscape covariates only (LS models) and (2) landscape covariates and an air temperature (Ta) metric (LS-Ta models). All the LS models included upstream catchment area and three included a river network smoother (RNS) that accounted for unexplained spatial structure. The LS models transferred reasonably to other catchments, at least when predicting relative levels of Twmax . However, the predictions were biased when mean Twmax differed between catchments. The RNS was needed to characterise and predict finer-scale spatially correlated variation. Because the RNS was unique to each catchment and thus non-transferable, predictions were better within catchments than between catchments. A single model fitted to all catchments found no interactions between the landscape covariates and catchment, suggesting that the landscape relationships were transferable.The LS-Ta models transferred less well, with particularly poor performance when the relationship with the Ta metric was physically implausible or required extrapolation outside the range of the data. A single model fitted to all catchments found catchment-specific relationships between Twmax and the Ta metric, indicating that the Ta metric was not transferable.These findings improve our understanding of the transferability of spatial statistical river temperature models and provide a foundation for developing new approaches for predicting Tw at unmonitored locations across multiple catchments and larger spatial scales. © Crown copyright 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:13","2018-01-19 22:53:13","","4727-4745","","9","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Regression analysis; Runoff; catchment; landscape; performance assessment; spatial analysis; regression analysis; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Catchments; river system; air temperature; Catchment area; feasibility study; Air temperature; New approaches; Poor performance; River catchment; River temperature; Spatial regression model; Spatial structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such is the case in the Elqui River valley of northern Chile, which draws on a limited-capacity reservoir to allocate 25 000 water rights. Delayed infrastructure investment forces water managers to address demand-based allocation strategies, particularly in dry years, which are realized through reductions in the volume associated with each water right. Skillful season-ahead streamflow forecasts have the potential to inform managers with an indication of future conditions to guide reservoir allocations. This work evaluates season-ahead statistical prediction models of October-January (growing season) streamflow at multiple lead times associated with manager and user decision points, and links predictions with a reservoir allocation tool. Skillful results (streamflow forecasts outperform climatology) are produced for short lead times (1 September: ranked probability skill score (RPSS) of 0.31, categorical hit skill score of 61 %). At longer lead times, climatological skill exceeds forecast skill due to fewer observations of precipitation. However, coupling the 1 September statistical forecast model with a sea surface temperature phase and strength statistical model allows for equally skillful categorical streamflow forecasts to be produced for a 1 May lead, triggered for 60 % of years (1950-2015), suggesting forecasts need not be strictly deterministic to be useful for water rights holders. An early (1 May) categorical indication of expected conditions is reinforced with a deterministic forecast (1 September) as more observations of local variables become available. The reservoir allocation model is skillful at the 1 September lead (categorical hit skill score of 53 %); skill improves to 79 % when categorical allocation prediction certainty exceeds 80 %. This result implies that allocation efficiency may improve when forecasts are integrated into reservoir decision frameworks. The methods applied here advance the understanding of the mechanisms and timing responsible for moisture transport to the Elqui Valley and provide a unique application of streamflow forecasting in the prediction of water right allocations. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:15","2018-01-19 22:53:15","","4711-4725","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Oceanography; Water resources; reservoir; streamflow; water supply; Statistical modeling; water management; sea surface temperature; Chile; Forecasting; Water supply; Investments; Landforms; Surface waters; precipitation (climatology); Reservoirs (water); semiarid region; Stream flow; Streamflow forecasting; Allocation efficiencies; Coquimbo; Deterministic forecasts; Elqui River; Elqui Valley; Infrastructure investment; International law; Managers; Produced Water; Ranked probability skill scores; Sea surface temperature (SST); Statistical prediction model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantifying this value, however, might not be straightforward as better forecast quality does not necessarily imply better decisions by the end users, especially when forecasts do not reach their final users, when providers are not trusted, or when forecasts are not appropriately understood. In this study, we contribute an assessment framework to evaluate the operational value of W&C services for informing agricultural practices by complementing traditional forecast quality assessments with a coupled human-natural system behavioural model which reproduces farmers' decisions. This allows a more critical assessment of the forecast value mediated by the end users' perspective, including farmers' risk attitudes and behavioural factors. The application to an agricultural area in northern Italy shows that the quality of state-of-the-art W&C services is still limited in predicting the weather and the crop yield of the incoming agricultural season, with ECMWF annual products simulated by the IFS/HOPE model resulting in the most skillful product in the study area. However, we also show that the accuracy of estimating crop yield and the probability of making optimal decisions are not necessarily linearly correlated, with the overall assessment procedure being strongly impacted by the behavioural attitudes of farmers, which can produce rank reversals in the quantification of the W&C services operational value depending on the different perceptions of risk and uncertainty.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:18","2018-01-19 22:53:18","","4693-4709","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Risk assessment; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Risk perception; Forecasting; Meteorology; Agriculture; economic conditions; Crops; nature-society relations; crop yield; Behavioral research; agricultural land; Agricultural areas; agricultural practice; Agricultural practices; Assessment procedure; Coupled human-natural systems; Critical assessment; farmers attitude; Optimal decisions; Perceptions of risks; Quality assessment; risk perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the techniques being used combines seasonal rainfall forecasts provided by operational weather forecast systems with hydrological modelling tools to provide estimates of seasonal mean river flows up to a few months ahead. The work presented here shows how spatial information contained in a distributed hydrological model typically requiring high-resolution (daily or better) rainfall data can be used to provide an initial condition for a much simpler forecast model tailored to use low-resolution monthly rainfall forecasts. Rainfall forecasts (""hindcasts"") from the GloSea5 model (1996 to 2009) are used to provide the first assessment of skill in these national-scale flow forecasts. The skill in the combined modelling system is assessed for different seasons and regions of Britain, and compared to what might be achieved using other approaches such as use of an ensemble of historical rainfall in a hydrological model, or a simple flow persistence forecast. The analysis indicates that only limited forecast skill is achievable for Spring and Summer seasonal hydrological forecasts; however, Autumn and Winter flows can be reasonably well forecast using (ensemble mean) rainfall forecasts based on either GloSea5 forecasts or historical rainfall (the preferred type of forecast depends on the region). Flow forecasts using ensemble mean GloSea5 rainfall perform most consistently well across Britain, and provide the most skilful forecasts overall at the 3-month lead time. Much of the skill (64 %) in the 1-month ahead seasonal flow forecasts can be attributed to the hydrological initial condition (particularly in regions with a significant groundwater contribution to flows), whereas for the 3-month ahead lead time, GloSea5 forecasts account for ∼ 70 % of the forecast skill (mostly in areas of high rainfall to the north and west) and only 30 % of the skill arises from hydrological memory (typically groundwater-dominated areas). Given the high spatial heterogeneity in typical patterns of UK rainfall and evaporation, future development of skilful spatially distributed seasonal forecasts could lead to substantial improvements in seasonal flow forecast capability, potentially benefitting practitioners interested in predicting hydrological extremes, not only in the UK but also across Europe. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:21","2018-01-19 22:53:21","","4681-4691","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","North Atlantic Oscillation; Rain; United Kingdom; prediction; rainfall; Hydrological extremes; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; Climate models; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Groundwater; seasonal variation; assessment method; Hydrology; forecasting method; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological modelling; Spatial heterogeneity; Hydrological forecasting; Distributed hydrological model; Hydrological forecast; climate conditions; persistence; Weather forecast system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in order to assess the impacts of Earth processes on river flows, simulated changes in runoff need to be routed through the landscape.

The purpose of the study was to create a tool capable of incorporating to hydrological predictions the terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate, carbon dioxide, and land-use change, as simulated with terrestrial biosphere models. The resulting ED2+R model calculates the lateral routing of surface and subsurface runoff resulting from the terrestrial biosphere models' vertical water balance in order to determine spatiotemporal patterns of river flows within the simulated region. We evaluated the ED2+R model in the Tapajós, a 476674km2 river basin in the southeastern Amazon, Brazil.

Nevertheless, modeling and predicting hydrological processes is critical in this region due to its vulnerability to the effects of climate change. Coarse-spatial-resolution datasets used in land surface modeling pose a new challenge in simulating the spatially distributed and basin-integrated processes since these datasets do not adequately represent the small-scale hydrological, thermal, and ecological heterogeneity. The goal of this study is to improve the prediction capacity of mesoscale to large-scale hydrological models by introducing a small-scale parameterization scheme, which better represents the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and vegetation cover in the Alaskan sub-arctic. The small-scale parameterization schemes are derived from observations and a sub-grid parameterization method in the two contrasting sub-basins of the Caribou Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW) in Interior Alaska: one nearly permafrost-free (LowP) sub-basin and one permafrost-dominated (HighP) sub-basin. The sub-grid parameterization method used in the small-scale parameterization scheme is derived from the watershed topography. We found that observed soil thermal and hydraulic properties - including the distribution of permafrost and vegetation cover heterogeneity - are better represented in the sub-grid parameterization method than the coarse-resolution datasets. Parameters derived from the coarse-resolution datasets and from the sub-grid parameterization method are implemented into the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) mesoscale hydrological model to simulate runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture in the two sub-basins of the CPCRW. Simulated hydrographs based on the small-scale parameterization capture most of the peak and low flows, with similar accuracy in both sub-basins, compared to simulated hydrographs based on the coarse-resolution datasets. On average, the small-scale parameterization scheme improves the total runoff simulation by up to 50 % in the LowP sub-basin and by up to 10 % in the HighP sub-basin from the large-scale parameterization. This study shows that the proposed sub-grid parameterization method can be used to improve the performance of mesoscale hydrological models in the Alaskan sub-arctic watersheds. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:25","2018-01-19 22:53:25","","4663-4680","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Runoff; United States; Vegetation; boreal forest; Ecology; hydrological modeling; parameterization; vegetation cover; Ecosystems; runoff; watershed; Variable infiltration capacities; infiltration; Watersheds; Hydrology; Large scale hydrological model; Soil moisture; Soils; Parameterization; Land surface modeling; climate effect; forest ecosystem; Spatial heterogeneity; Parameterization schemes; permafrost; Permafrost; Alaska; Boreal forest ecosystems; Discontinuous permafrost; Parameterization method; Poker Creek; Rangifer tarandus; soil property","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This phenomenon, commonly referred to as ""the Sahelian paradox"", is not completely understood yet. The role of cropland expansion due to the increasing food demand by a growing population has been often put forward to explain this situation for the cultivated Sahel. However, this hypothesis does not hold in pastoral areas where the same phenomenon is observed. Several other processes, such as the degradation of natural vegetation following the major droughts of the 1970s and the 1980s, the development of crusted topsoils, the intensification of the rainfall regime and the development of the drainage network, have been suggested to account for this situation. In this paper, a modeling approach is proposed to explore, quantify and rank different processes that could be at play in pastoral Sahel. The kinematic runoff and erosion model (KINEROS-2) is applied to the Agoufou watershed (245km2), in the Gourma region in Mali, which underwent a significant increase of surface runoff during the last 60 years. Two periods are simulated, the ""past"" case (1960&ndash;1975) preceding the Sahelian drought and the ""present"" case (2000&ndash;2015). Surface hydrology and land cover characteristics for these two periods are derived by the analysis of aerial photographs, available in 1956, and high-resolution remote sensing images in 2011. The major changes identified are (1) a partial crusting of isolated dunes, (2) an increase of drainage network density, (3) a marked decrease in vegetation with the nonrecovery of tiger bush and vegetation growing on shallow sandy soils, and (4) important changes in soil properties with the apparition of impervious soils instead of shallow sandy soil. The KINEROS-2 model was parameterized to simulate these changes in combination or independently. The results obtained by this model display a significant increase in annual discharge between the ""past"" and the ""present"" case (p value&lt;0.001), which is consistent with observations, despite a slight overestimation of the past discharge. Mean annual discharges are estimated at 0.51 × 106m3 (2.1mmyr-1) and 3.29 × 106m3 (13.4mmyr-1) for past and present, respectively. Changes in soil properties and vegetation cover (tiger bush thickets and grassland on shallow sandy soil) are found to be the main factors causing this increase of simulated runoff, with the drainage network development contributing to a lesser extent but with a positive feedback. These results shed a new light on the Sahelian paradox phenomenon in the absence of land use change and call for further tests in other areas and/or with other models. The synergetic processes highlighted here could play a role in other Sahelian watersheds where runoff increase has been also observed. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:30","2018-01-19 22:53:30","","4591-4613","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Vegetation; discharge; drought; rainfall; surface water; land cover; remote sensing; Drought; hydrological modeling; vegetation cover; Land use; runoff; watershed; Cultivation; Watersheds; hydrological change; Remote sensing; Forestry; drainage network; sandy soil; Soils; Surface waters; precipitation (climatology); land use change; topsoil; agricultural land; grassland; satellite imagery; Soil testing; Surface hydrology; Aerial Photographs; Agoufou; Drainage; Drainage networks; Erosion modeling; Gao [Mali]; Gourma-Rharous; High resolution remote sensing images; Hydrological changes; Image reconstruction; Mali; Natural vegetation; Past and present; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sand; Tombouctou [Mali]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we examine the effects of such errors on the MTTs and young water fractions estimated using tritium concentrations in two-part hydrological systems. We find that MTTs derived from tritium concentrations in streamflow are just as susceptible to aggregation bias as those from seasonal tracer cycles. Likewise, groundwater wells or springs fed by two or more water sources with different MTTs will also have aggregation bias. However, the transit times over which the biases are manifested are different because the two methods are applicable over different time ranges, up to 5 years for seasonal tracer cycles and up to 200 years for tritium concentrations. Our virtual experiments with two water components show that the aggregation errors are larger when the MTT differences between the components are larger and the amounts of the components are each close to 50% of the mixture. We also find that young water fractions derived from tritium (based on a young water threshold of 18 years) are almost immune to aggregation errors as were those derived from seasonal tracer cycles with a threshold of about 2 months. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:32","2018-01-19 22:53:32","","4615-4627","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; groundwater; spatial analysis; streamflow; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Catchments; error analysis; Errors; Spatial heterogeneity; tracer; Virtual reality; threshold; Aggregation errors; Groundwater system; Hydrological system; Lumped parameter models; Mean transit time; tritium; Tritium; Tritium concentration; Virtual experiments; well","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Van der Burgh's coefficient, K, is a good proxy for describing the relative contribution of tide-driven and gravitational (dischargedriven and density-driven) components of salt transport in estuaries. However, debate continues over the use of the K value for an estuary where K should be a constant, spatially varying, or time-independent factor for different river discharge conditions. In this study, we determined K during spring and neap tides in the dry (&lt; 30m-3- s-1-/ and wet (&gt; 750m-3- s-1-/ seasons in a salt plug estuary with an exponentially varying width and depth, to examine the relative contributions of tidal versus density-driven salt transport mechanisms. High-resolution salinity data were used to determine K. Discharge-driven gravitational circulation (K ∼0.8) was entirely dominant over tidal dispersion during spring and neap tides in the wet season, to the extent that salt transport upstream was effectively reduced, resulting in the estuary remaining in a relatively fresh state. In contrast, K increased gradually seaward (K ∼0.74) and landward (K ∼0.74) from the salt plug area (K ∼0.65) during the dry season, similar to an inverse and positive estuary, respectively. As a result, density-driven inverse gravitational circulation between the salt plug and the sea facilitates inverse estuarine circulation. On the other hand, positive estuarine circulation between the salt plug and the river arose due to density-driven positive gravitational circulation during the dry season, causing the upstream intrusion of high-salinity bottom water. Our results explicitly show that K varies spatially and depends on the river discharge. This result provides a better understanding of the distribution of hydrographic properties. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:34","2018-01-19 22:53:34","","4563-4572","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; High resolution; dry season; river discharge; climate change; Drought; Rivers; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; spatiotemporal analysis; hydrodynamics; Spatio-temporal variation; Estuaries; bottom water; Discharge driven; Estuarine circulation; estuarine environment; Hydrographic properties; Relative contribution; River discharge; Tides; Time independents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The maximum rolling 4, 12, 24, and 36 h rainfall amounts of these storms are assessed via surface trend fitting, and the spatial correlation of the detrended residuals is determined through studying the scales of fluctuation along eight directions. The principal directions of the surface trend are between 19 and 43-, and the major and minor axis lengths are 83-386 and 55-79 km, respectively. The scales of fluctuation of the residuals are found between 5 and 30 km.

Tree water-use measurements have therefore become an important component of recent hydrological studies. It is difficult for South African government initiatives, such as the Working for Water (WfW) alien clearing program, to justify alien tree removal and implement rehabilitation unless hydrological benefits are known. Consequently, water use within a riparian forest along the Buffeljags River in the Western Cape of South Africa was monitored over a 3-year period. The site consisted of an indigenous stand of Western Cape afrotemperate forest adjacent to a large stand of introduced <i>Acacia mearnsii</i>. The heat ratio method of the heat pulse velocity sap flow technique was used to measure the sap flow of a selection of indigenous species in the indigenous stand, a selection of <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees in the alien stand and two clusters of indigenous species within the alien stand. The indigenous trees in the alien stand at Buffeljags River showed significant intraspecific differences in the daily sap flow rates varying from 15 to 32ĝ€Lĝ€dayĝ'1 in summer (sap flow being directly proportional to tree size). In winter (June), this was reduced to only 7ĝ€Lĝ€dayĝ'1 when limited energy was available to drive the transpiration process. The water use in the <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees showed peaks in transpiration during the months of March 2012, September 2012 and February 2013. These periods had high average temperatures, rainfall and high daily vapor pressure deficits (VPDs-average of 1.26ĝ€kPa). The average daily sap flow ranged from 25 to 35ĝ€L in summer and approximately 10ĝ€L in the winter. The combined accumulated daily sap flow per year for the three <i>Vepris lanceolata</i> and three <i>A. mearnsii</i> trees was 5700 and 9200ĝ€L, respectively, clearly demonstrating the higher water use of the introduced <i>Acacia</i> trees during the winter months. After spatially upscaling the findings, it was concluded that, annually, the alien stand used nearly 6 times more water per unit area than the indigenous stand (585ĝ€mmĝ€aĝ'1 compared to 101ĝ€mmĝ€aĝ'1). This finding indicates that there would be a gain in groundwater recharge and/or streamflow if the alien species are removed from riparian forests and rehabilitated back to their natural state.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:39","2018-01-19 22:53:39","","4551-4562","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; groundwater; rainfall; streamflow; Groundwater; water resource; seasonal variation; Forestry; Ground water recharge; recharge; Mediterranean climates; Acacia; Acacia mearnsii; Buffels River; evergreen tree; Heat ratio methods; Intra-specific differences; intraspecific variation; introduced species; Lanceolata; legume; Northern Cape; riparian forest; Riparian forests; sap flow; South Africa; South African government; stand structure; temperate forest; Transpiration; Vapor pressure deficit; Western Cape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Substantial uncertainty remains, however, in the amplitude of GRACE gravity signals and the disaggregation of TWS into individual terrestrial water stores (e.g. groundwater storage). Here, we test the phase and amplitude of three GRACE ΔTWS signals from five commonly used gridded products (i.e. NASA's GRCTellus: CSR, JPL, GFZ; JPL-Mascons; GRGS GRACE) using in situ data and modelled soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) in two sub-basins (LVB: Lake Victoria Basin; LKB: Lake Kyoga Basin) of the Upper Nile Basin. The analysis extends from January 2003 to December 2012, but focuses on a large and accurately observed reduction in ΔTWS of 83km3 from 2003 to 2006 in the Lake Victoria Basin. We reveal substantial variability in current GRACE products to quantify the reduction of ΔTWS in Lake Victoria that ranges from 80km3 (JPL-Mascons) to 69 and 31km3 for GRGS and GRCTellus respectively. Representation of the phase in TWS in the Upper Nile Basin by GRACE products varies but is generally robust with GRGS, JPL-Mascons, and GRCTellus (ensemble mean of CSR, JPL, and GFZ time-series data), explaining 90, 84, and 75% of the variance respectively in ""in situ"" or ""bottom-up"" ΔTWS in the LVB. Resolution of changes in groundwater storage (ΔGWS) from GRACE ΔTWS is greatly constrained by both uncertainty in changes in soil-moisture storage (ΔSMS) modelled by GLDAS LSMs (CLM, NOAH, VIC) and the low annual amplitudes in ΔGWS (e.g. 1.8-4.9cm) observed in deeply weathered crystalline rocks underlying the Upper Nile Basin. Our study highlights the substantial uncertainty in the amplitude of ΔTWS that can result from different data-processing strategies in commonly used, gridded GRACE products; this uncertainty is disregarded in analyses of ΔTWS and individual stores applying a single GRACE product. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:41","2018-01-19 22:53:41","","4533-4549","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Land data assimilation systems; groundwater; satellite data; soil moisture; GRACE; Uncertainty analysis; data processing; Groundwater; Data handling; Water conservation; in situ measurement; Soil moisture; water storage; Digital storage; Lakes; terrestrial environment; East African Lakes; Moisture; amplitude; Crystalline rocks; Geodetic satellites; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Groundwater storage; In-situ observations; Lake Kyoga; Lake Victoria; Moisture storage; NASA; Processing strategies; South Sudan; Terrestrial water storage; Time-series data; Uganda; Upper Nile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results demonstrate that in some regions of western, central, and eastern Africa with typically wet climates, even a perfect tercile forecast of seasonal total rainfall would provide little to no indication of the seasonal likelihood of flooding. The number of extreme events within a season shows the highest correlations with floodiness consistently across regions. Otherwise, results vary across climate regimes: Floodiness in arid regions in southern and eastern Africa shows the strongest correlations with seasonal average soil moisture and seasonal total rainfall. Floodiness in wetter climates of western and central Africa and Madagascar shows the strongest relationship with measures of the intensity of seasonal rainfall.

Such a signature has a distinct advantage over other statistical indicators such as standard deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation (CV) as it expresses hydrological variability in human terms, which directly indicates the difficulty and ease of managing discharge variation for water resource management. The signature is presented in the form of geographical distribution, in terms of both necessary storage (km3) and normalized necessary storage (months), and is related to the basin characteristics of hydrological heterogeneity. The signature is analyzed in different basins considering the Hurst equation of range as a reference. The slope of such a relation and the scatter of departures from the average relation are analyzed in terms of their relationship with basin characteristics. As a method of calculating necessary storage, the flood duration curve (FDC) and drought duration curve (DDC) methods are employed in view of their relative advantage over other methods to repeat the analysis over many grid points. The Ganges Meghna (GBM) basin is selected as the case study and the BTOPMC hydrological model with Water and Global Change (WATCH) Forcing Data (WFD) is used for estimating FDC and DDC. It is concluded that the necessary storage serves as a useful signature of discharge variability, and its analysis could be extended to the entire globe and in this way seek new insights into hydrological variability in the storage domain at a larger range of scales. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:48","2018-01-19 22:53:48","","4495-4516","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; Water resources; discharge; water management; hydrological modeling; global change; water resource; hydrological change; Human resource management; Hydrological modeling; water storage; Digital storage; flood; Waterresource management; Basin characteristics; Coefficient of variation; Electric network topology; Ganges Basin; Geographical distribution; Hydrological heterogeneity; Hydrological variability; Standard deviation; Statistical indicators; storage structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage (TWS) estimates to examine temporal variability of the NDVI across Australia. We aim to demonstrate a new method that reveals the moisture dependence of vegetation cover at different temporal resolutions. Time series of monthly GRACE TWS anomalies are decomposed into different temporal frequencies using a discrete wavelet transform and analysed against time series of the NDVI anomalies in a stepwise regression. The results show that combinations of different frequencies of decomposed GRACE TWS data explain NDVI temporal variations better than raw GRACE TWS alone. Generally, the NDVI appears to be more sensitive to interannual changes in water storage than shorter changes, though grassland-dominated areas are sensitive to higher-frequencies of water-storage changes. Different types of vegetation, defined by areas of land use type, show distinct differences in how they respond to the changes in water storage, which is generally consistent with our physical understanding. This unique method provides useful insight into how the NDVI is affected by changes in water storage at different temporal scales across land use types. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:50","2018-01-19 22:53:50","","4469-4478","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; NDVI; Time series; Vegetation; Wavelet transforms; satellite data; GRACE; regression analysis; vegetation cover; Land use; water storage; Digital storage; land use change; annual variation; Moisture; Temporal resolution; Temporal variability; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Different frequency; Discrete wavelet transforms; Large spatial scale; Moisture dependence; Normalised difference vegetation index; Vegetation response; vegetation type","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We monitor infiltration dynamics at multiple scales (up to the scale of the entire pond) by measuring the ponding depth, sediment water content and groundwater levels, using pressure sensors, single-ring infiltrometers, soil sensors, and observation wells. During a month (January 2015) of continuous intensive MAR (2.45 × 106m3 discharged to a 10.7ha area), groundwater level has risen by 17m attaining full connection with the pond, while average infiltration rates declined by almost 2 orders of magnitude (from ∼ 11 to ∼ 0.4md-1). This reduction can be explained solely by the lithology of the unsaturated zone that includes relatively low-permeability sediments. Clogging processes at the pond-surface - abundant in many MAR operations - are negated by the high-quality desalinated seawater (turbidity ∼ 0.2NTU, total dissolved solids ∼ 120mgL-1) or negligible compared to the low-permeability layers. Recharge during infiltration was estimated reasonably well by simple analytical models, whereas a numerical model was used for estimating groundwater recharge after the end of infiltration. It was found that a calibrated numerical model with a one-dimensional representative sediment profile is able to capture MAR dynamics, including temporal reduction of infiltration rates, drainage and groundwater recharge. Measured infiltration rates of an independent MAR event (January 2016) fitted well to those calculated by the calibrated numerical model, showing the model validity. The successful quantification methodologies of the temporal groundwater recharge are useful for MAR practitioners and can serve as an input for groundwater flow models. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:52","2018-01-19 22:53:52","","4479-4493","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Sediments; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Seawater; numerical model; calibration; infiltration; model validation; sensor; groundwater flow; vadose zone; Lakes; sediment-water interface; quantitative analysis; monitoring; Ground water recharge; Dynamics; drainage; Infiltration; Recharging (underground waters); Lithology; coastal aquifer; desalination; Groundwater Flow Model; lithology; Managed aquifer recharges; Numerical models; Observation wells; Orders of magnitude; Sediment profiles; Surface infiltration; Total dissolved solids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Local historical point rainfall series often cover several decades, which makes it possible to estimate rainfall means at different timescales, and to assess return periods of extreme events. Due to climate change, however, these series are most likely not representative of future rainfall. There is therefore a demand for climate-projected long rainfall series, which can represent a specific region and rainfall pattern as well as fulfil requirements of long rainfall series which includes climate changes projected to a specific future period. <br><br> This paper presents a framework for resampling of historical point rainfall series in order to generate synthetic rainfall series, which has the same statistical properties as an original series. Using a number of key target predictions for the future climate, such as winter and summer precipitation, and representation of extreme events, the resampled historical series are projected to represent rainfall properties in a future climate. Climate-projected rainfall series are simulated by brute force randomization of model parameters, which leads to a large number of projected series. In order to evaluate and select the rainfall series with matching statistical properties as the key target projections, an extensive evaluation procedure is developed. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:55","2018-01-19 22:53:55","","4433-4448","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate projection; Rain; design; hydrology; rainfall; statistical analysis; climate change; Climate models; numerical model; sampling; Sampling; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic systems; Hydrology; extreme event; stochasticity; Model parameters; Rainfall patterns; environmental history; Original series; Statistical properties; Summer precipitation; Synthetic rainfalls; Target prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four types of microwave-based, surface satellite soil moisture were used. The core remotely sensed data for this study came from NASA's long-lasting AMSR-E mission. Additionally, three other products were obtained from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI). These datasets were blended based on all available satellite observations (CCI-active, CCI-passive, and CCI-combined). All of these products were 0.25° and taken daily. We applied the filter to produce a soil moisture index (SWI) that others have successfully used to estimate RZSM. The only unknown in this approach was the characteristic time of soil moisture variation (T ). We examined five different eras (1997-2002; 2002-2005; 2005-2008; 2008-2011; 2011-2014) that represented periods with different satellite data sensors. SWI values were compared with in situ soil moisture data from the International Soil Moisture Network at a depth ranging from 20 to 25g cm. Selected networks included the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program (25g cm), Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN; 20.32g cm), SNOwpack ℡emetry (SNO℡; 20.32g cm), and the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN; 20g cm). We selected in situ stations that had reasonable completeness. These datasets were used to filter out periods with freezing temperatures and rainfall using data from the Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). Additionally, we only examined sites where surface and root-zone soil moisture had a reasonably high lagged r value (r &gt; 0. 5). The unknown T value was constrained based on two approaches: optimization of root mean square error (RMSE) and calculation based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value. Both approaches yielded comparable results; although, as to be expected, the optimization approach generally outperformed NDVI-based estimates. The best results were noted at stations that had an absolute bias within 10g %. SWI estimates were more impacted by the in situ network than the surface satellite product used to drive the exponential filter. The average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSs) for ARM ranged from g'0. 1 to 0.3 and were similar to the results obtained from the USCRN network (0.2-0.3). NS values from the SCAN and SNO℡ networks were slightly higher (0.1-0.5). These results indicated that this approach had some skill in providing an estimate of RZSM. In terms of RMSE (in volumetric soil moisture), ARM values actually outperformed those from other networks (0.02-0.04). SCAN and USCRN RMSE average values ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 and SNO℡ average RMSE values were higher (0.05-0.07). These values were close to 0.04, which is the baseline value for accuracy designated for many satellite soil moisture missions. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:57","2018-01-19 22:53:57","","4403-4417","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; NDVI; optimization; satellite data; soil moisture; data set; remote sensing; Bandpass filters; Satellites; accuracy assessment; Soil moisture; Soils; Digital storage; Mean square error; Soil surveys; Moisture; rhizosphere; Root zone soil moistures; Satellite soil moisture; Us climate reference networks; Passive filters; NASA; Constrained optimization; AMSR-E; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric radiation measurement programs; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; Normalized difference vegetation index; satellite sensor; Space flight; US Department of Energy; Volumetric soil moistures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with this issue, many bias correction techniques have been developed to adjust the modelled variables against observations, focusing mainly on precipitation and temperature. However, most state-of-the-art hydrological models require more forcing variables, in addition to precipitation and temperature, such as radiation, humidity, air pressure, and wind speed. The biases in these additional variables can hinder hydrological simulations, but the effect of the bias of each variable is unexplored. Here we examine the effect of GCM biases on historical runoff simulations for each forcing variable individually, using the JULES land surface model set up at the global scale. Based on the quantified effect, we assess which variables should be included in bias correction procedures. To this end, a partial correction bias assessment experiment is conducted, to test the effect of the biases of six climate variables from a set of three GCMs. The effect of the bias of each climate variable individually is quantified by comparing the changes in simulated runoff that correspond to the bias of each tested variable. A methodology for the classification of the effect of biases in four effect categories (ECs), based on the magnitude and sensitivity of runoff changes, is developed and applied. Our results show that, while globally the largest changes in modelled runoff are caused by precipitation and temperature biases, there are regions where runoff is substantially affected by and/or more sensitive to radiation and humidity. Global maps of bias ECs reveal the regions mostly affected by the bias of each variable. Based on our findings, for global-scale applications, bias correction of radiation and humidity, in addition to that of precipitation and temperature, is advised. Finer spatial-scale information is also provided, to suggest bias correction of variables beyond precipitation and temperature for regional studies. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:53:59","2018-01-19 22:53:59","","4379-4401","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; solar radiation; climate modeling; land surface; Hydrological models; Global climate model; hydrological modeling; Wind; Climate models; Surface measurement; runoff; experimental study; Land surface modeling; precipitation (climatology); Hydrological simulations; air temperature; climate forcing; Climate variables; humidity; Runoff simulation; State of the art; Temperature bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, annual streamflow, sediment yield, and sediment concentration have all decreased considerably. Human-induced land use/cover change (LUCC) was the dominant factor, contributing over 70g % of the sediment load reduction, whereas the contribution of precipitation was less than 30g %. In this study, we use 50-year time series data (1961-2011), showing decreasing trends in the annual sediment loads of 15 catchments, to generate spatio-temporal patterns in the effects of LUCC and precipitation variability on sediment yield. The space-time variability of sediment yield was expressed notionally as a product of two factors representing (i) the effect of precipitation and (ii) the fraction of treated land surface area. Under minimal LUCC, the square root of annual sediment yield varied linearly with precipitation, with the precipitation-sediment load relationship showing coherent spatial patterns amongst the catchments. As the LUCC increased and took effect, the changes in sediment yield pattern depended more on engineering measures and vegetation restoration campaign, and the within-year rainfall patterns (especially storm events) also played an important role. The effect of LUCC is expressed in terms of a sediment coefficient, i.e., the ratio of annual sediment yield to annual precipitation. Sediment coefficients showed a steady decrease over the study period, following a linear decreasing function of the fraction of treated land surface area. In this way, the study has brought out the separate roles of precipitation variability and LUCC in controlling spatio-temporal patterns of sediment yield at catchment scale. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:01","2018-01-19 22:54:01","","4363-4678","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Runoff; catchment; rainfall; streamflow; land cover; Sediments; Surface measurement; anthropogenic effect; Land use; spatiotemporal analysis; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Landforms; soil erosion; precipitation (climatology); Soil conservation; land use; Loess Plateau; Spatiotemporal patterns; China's loess plateaux; Coherent spatial patterns; land degradation; Land use/cover change; Precipitation variability; revegetation; Revegetation; sediment analysis; Sediment concentration; sediment yield; Space-time variability; Vegetation restoration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, SWAT has limitations in simulating the seasonal growth cycles for trees and perennial vegetation in the tropics, where rainfall rather than temperature is the dominant plant growth controlling factor. Our goal is to improve the vegetation growth module of SWAT for simulating the vegetation variables - such as the leaf area index (LAI) - for tropical ecosystems. Therefore, we present a modified SWAT version for the tropics (SWAT-T) that uses a straightforward but robust soil moisture index (SMI) - a quotient of rainfall (<i>P</i>) and reference evapotranspiration (ETr) - to dynamically initiate a new growth cycle within a predefined period. Our results for the Mara Basin (Kenya/Tanzania) show that the SWAT-T-simulated LAI corresponds well with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI for evergreen forest, savanna grassland and shrubland. This indicates that the SMI is reliable for triggering a new annual growth cycle. The water balance components (evapotranspiration and streamflow) simulated by the SWAT-T exhibit a good agreement with remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET-RS) and observed streamflow. The SWAT-T model, with the proposed vegetation growth module for tropical ecosystems, can be a robust tool for simulating the vegetation growth dynamics in hydrologic models in tropical regions. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:03","2018-01-19 22:54:03","","4449-4467","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Rain; Reference evapotranspiration; Vegetation; Water management; streamflow; ecohydrology; remote sensing; climate change; water management; Ecology; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Land use; Ecosystems; soil and water assessment tool; Management practices; Soil and water assessment tool; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Plants (botany); Climate change impact; evergreen forest; land use change; Stream flow; MODIS; shrubland; vegetation dynamics; leaf area index; Radiometers; Image reconstruction; Controlling factors; Eco-hydrological models; Kenya; Mara Basin; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Research and development management; Satellite imagery; savanna; Tanzania; tropical environment; Tropics; Water balance components","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of evaporation experiments were also conducted in the desert to examine how the isotopic signature of water may change during evaporation and infiltration under local environmental conditions. The results show that the lakes in the southeastern sand dune area are fed by groundwater discharging into the lakes and that local groundwater, on the other hand, is derived primarily from modern meteoric precipitation in the region. Although dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in groundwater yielded very old radiocarbon ages, the presence of detectable amounts of tritium in groundwater samples, together with their 2H, 18O and d -excess characteristics, strongly suggests that the old radiocarbon ages of DIC do not represent the residence time of water in the aquifer but are the result of addition of old DIC derived from dissolution of ancient carbonates in the aquifer. The data do not support the hypothesis that the water in the Badain Jaran Desert was sourced in remote mountains on the northern Tibetan Plateau. This study also finds no support for the hypothesis that present-day water resources in the desert were recharged by the precipitation that fell in the past during the early Holocene when the climate was much wetter than today.

However, TC requires the simultaneous availability of three products with mutually uncorrelated errors, a requirement which is difficult to satisfy with current global precipitation data sets. <br><br> In this study, a recently developed method for rainfall estimation from soil moisture observations, SM2RAIN, is demonstrated to facilitate the accurate application of TC within triplets containing two state-of-the-art satellite rainfall estimates and a reanalysis product. The validity of different TC assumptions are indirectly tested via a high-quality ground rainfall product over the contiguous United States (CONUS), showing that SM2RAIN can provide a truly independent source of rainfall accumulation information which uniquely satisfies the assumptions underlying TC.

Applying the same model structure at different spatial scales requires that the model estimates similar fluxes independent of the chosen resolution, i.e., fulfills a flux-matching condition across scales. An analysis of state-of-the-art LSMs and HMs reveals that most do not have consistent hydrologic parameter fields. Multiple experiments with the mHM, Noah-MP, PCR-GLOBWB, and WaterGAP models demonstrate the pitfalls of deficient parameterization practices currently used in most operational models, which are insufficient to satisfy the flux-matching condition. These examples demonstrate that J. Dooge's 1982 statement on the unsolved problem of parameterization in these models remains true. Based on a review of existing parameter regionalization techniques, we postulate that the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique offers a practical and robust method that provides consistent (seamless) parameter and flux fields across scales. Herein, we develop a general model protocol to describe how MPR can be applied to a particular model and present an example application using the PCR-GLOBWB model. Finally, we discuss potential advantages and limitations of MPR in obtaining the seamless prediction of hydrological fluxes and states across spatial scales. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:11","2018-01-19 22:54:11","","4323-4346","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Earth sciences; Hydrologic models; Spatial resolution; catchment; prediction; spatial analysis; hydrological modeling; parameterization; numerical model; Catchments; Hydrology; spatial resolution; Hydrologic parameters; Hydrologic prediction; Matching condition; Operational model; Parameter regionalization; Unsolved problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These signals can be complicated in carbonate aquifers, as both abiotic (i.e., carbonate equilibria) and biotic factors influence the σ13C and 14C of DIC. We applied a novel graphical method for tracking changes in the σ13C and 14C of DIC in two distinct aquifer complexes identified in the Hainich Critical Zone Exploratory (CZE), a platform to study how water transport links surface and shallow groundwaters in limestone and marlstone rocks in central Germany. For more quantitative estimates of contributions of different biotic and abiotic carbon sources to the DIC pool, we used the NETPATH geochemical modeling program, which accounts for changes in dissolved ions in addition to C isotopes. Although water residence times in the Hainich CZE aquifers based on hydrogeology are relatively short (years or less), DIC isotopes in the shallow, mostly anoxic, aquifer assemblage (HTU) were depleted in 14C compared to a deeper, oxic, aquifer complex (HTL). Carbon isotopes and chemical changes in the deeper HTL wells could be explained by interaction of recharge waters equilibrated with post-bomb 14C sources with carbonates. However, oxygen depletion and σ13C and 14C values of DIC below those expected from the processes of carbonate equilibrium alone indicate considerably different biogeochemical evolution of waters in the upper aquifer assemblage (HTU wells). Changes in 14C and 13C in the upper aquifer complexes result from a number of biotic and abiotic processes, including oxidation of 14C-depleted OM derived from recycled microbial carbon and sedimentary organic matter as well as water-rock interactions. The microbial pathways inferred from DIC isotope shifts and changes in water chemistry in the HTU wells were supported by comparison with in situ microbial community structure based on 16S rRNA analyses. Our findings demonstrate the large variation in the importance of biotic as well as abiotic controls on 13C and 14C of DIC in closely related aquifer assemblages. Further, they support the importance of subsurface-derived carbon sources like DIC for chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms as well as rock-derived organic matter for supporting heterotrophic groundwater microbial communities and indicate that even shallow aquifers have microbial communities that use a variety of subsurface-derived carbon sources. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:16","2018-01-19 22:54:16","","4283-4300","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; groundwater; Hydrogeology; hydrogeology; C (programming language); aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; oxidation; Carbon; graphical method; Biogeochemistry; Chemical analysis; Organic carbon; bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; Isotopes; water chemistry; abiotic factor; Hainich; Hydrochemistry; Sedimentary rocks; Thuringia; Water rock interactions; organic matter; Biological materials; Organic compounds; Limestone; dissolved inorganic carbon; Dissolved inorganic carbon; biotic factor; carbon isotope; Carbonate equilibriums; Carbonation; Chemolithoautotrophic; community structure; Different carbon sources; Dissolution; limestone; marl; Microbial community structures; Microorganisms; Quantitative estimates; RNA; Sedimentary organic matter; water-rock interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are heterogeneously distributed within a watershed but often interrelated and subject to a certain spatial organization which results in archetypes of combined characteristics. In order to reproduce the natural rainfall-runoff response the reduction of variance of catchment properties as well as the incorporation of the spatial organization of the catchment are desirable. In this study the width-function approach is utilized as a basic characteristic to analyse the succession of catchment characteristics. By applying this technique we were able to assess the context of catchment properties like soil or topology along the streamflow length and the network geomorphology, giving indications of the spatial organization of a catchment. Moreover, this information and this technique have been implemented in an algorithm for automated sub-basin ascertainment, which included the definition of zones within the newly defined sub-basins. The objective was to provide sub-basins that were less heterogeneous than common separation schemes. The algorithm was applied to two parameters characterizing the topology and soil of four mid-European watersheds. Resulting partitions indicated a wide range of applicability for the method and the algorithm. Additionally, the intersection of derived zones for different catchment characteristics could give insights into sub-basin similarities.

The approach followed is based on several climate projections obtained from the EURO-CORDEX initiative, raw and bias-corrected realizations of catchment precipitation, and flow simulations derived using multiple hydrological model parameter sets. The projections cover the 21st century. Three sources of uncertainty are considered: one related to climate projection ensemble spread, the second related to the uncertainty in hydrological model parameters and the third related to the error in fitting theoretical distribution models to annual extreme flow series. The uncertainty of projected extreme indices related to hydrological model parameters was conditioned on flow observations from the reference period using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach, with separate criteria for high-and low-flow extremes. Extreme (low and high) flow quantiles were estimated using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution at different return periods and were based on two different lengths of the flow time series. A sensitivity analysis based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the uncertainty introduced by the hydrological model parameters can be larger than the climate model variability and the distribution fit uncertainty for the low-flow extremes whilst for the high-flow extremes higher uncertainty is observed from climate models than from hydrological parameter and distribution fit uncertainties. This implies that ignoring one of the three uncertainty sources may cause great risk to future hydrological extreme adaptations and water resource planning and management.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:20","2018-01-19 22:54:20","","4245-4258","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; Water resources; catchment; river flow; Hydrological extremes; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; water resource; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; climate prediction; variance analysis; precipitation (climatology); ensemble forecasting; Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation; return period; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Sources of uncertainty; Biala River; Generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions; Hydrological parameters; Modeling variability; Poland [Central Europe]; Slaskie; Water resource planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to investigate the evolution of natural and crop vegetation systems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) over the past 2000 years. Archived Landsat images, historical land use maps and hydrological records were introduced to derive the long-term spatial distribution of natural and crop vegetation and the corresponding biomass levels. The major findings are that (1) both natural and crop vegetation experienced three development stages: a pre-development stage (before the Republic of China), a rapid development stage (Republic of China - 2000), and a post-development stage (after 2000). Climate and hydrological conditions did not show significant impacts over crop vegetation, while streamflow presented synchronous changes with natural vegetation in the first stage. For the second stage, warmer temperature and increasing streamflow were found to be important factors for the increase in both natural and crop vegetation in the middle reaches of the HRB. For the third stage, positive climate and hydrological conditions, together with policy interventions, supported the overall vegetation increase in both the middle and lower HRB; (2) there was a significantly faster increase in crop biomass than that of native vegetation since 1949, which could be explained by the technological development; and (3) the ratio of natural vegetation to crop vegetation decreased from 16 during the Yuan Dynasty to about 2.2 since 2005. This ratio reflects the reaction of land and water development to a changing climate and altering social-economic conditions at the river basin level; therefore, it could be used as an indicator of water and land management at river basins. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:23","2018-01-19 22:54:23","","4233-4244","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Vegetation; Water management; streamflow; sustainability; climate change; Rivers; Land use; Crops; Watersheds; hydrological change; spatial distribution; River basin management; basin management; Hydrological condition; Stream flow; technological development; Landsat; satellite imagery; vegetation dynamics; land management; Gansu; Natural vegetation; Development stages; development strategy; Heihe Basin; Heihe river basin; long-term change; paleoecology; Policy intervention; socioeconomic conditions; Technological development; Vegetation systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a previous study, we showed that Halon-1301 reliably inferred groundwater age at the majority of groundwater sites studied. At those sites, ages inferred from Halon-1301 agreed with those inferred from SF6 and tritium, two reliable widely applied groundwater age tracers. A few samples, however, showed reduced concentrations of Halon-1301, preventing meaningful age interpretation from its concentration. These reduced concentrations were likely a result of degradation or retardation of Halon-1301 in the aquifer. However, we could not provide full evidence for this due to the limited number of groundwater samples analysed (18 in total). In this study, we assess the potential of Halon-1301 as a groundwater age tracer for a larger dataset of groundwater samples under specific groundwater conditions, including highly anoxic young groundwater which can significantly degrade Halon-1301, to gain more information on the magnitude of occurrence and the causes of reduced Halon-1301 concentrations. <br><br> In this study, we analysed 302 groundwater samples for Halon-1301, SF6, tritium and the CFCs CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113. Comparison of age information inferred from the concentrations of these tracers allows assessment of the performance of Halon-1301 compared to other well established and widely used age tracers. The samples are taken from different groundwater environments in New Zealand and include anoxic and oxic waters with mean residence times ranging from 2 years to over 150 years (tritium-free). The majority of assessed samples have reduced or elevated concentrations of CFCs, which makes it impossible to infer a reliable age using the CFCs for these samples. Halon-1301, however, reliably infers ages for CFC-contaminated waters. Three other groundwater samples were found to have elevated SF6 concentrations (contaminated). Again, at these SF6-contaminated sites, ages inferred from Halon-1301 agree with ages inferred from tritium. A few samples (14 sites) exhibit reduced concentrations of Halon-1301, which result in elevated inferred Halon-1301 ages in comparison to those inferred from SF6, tritium and/or CFC-113. Assessment of the groundwater environment at these sites gives further insight into the potential causes of Halon-1301 reduction in groundwater. Overall, Halon-1301 gives age information that matches ages inferred from SF6 and/or tritium for the majority (97-%) of the assessed groundwater sites. These findings suggest that Halon-1301 is a reasonably reliable groundwater age tracer, and is in particular significantly more reliable than the CFCs, which may have contamination and degradation problems. Halon-1301 thus has potential to become a useful groundwater age tracer where SF6 and the CFCs are compromised, and where additional independent tracers are needed to constrain complex mixing models. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:25","2018-01-19 22:54:25","","4213-4231","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; groundwater; New Zealand; aquifer; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Water pollution; tracer; groundwater pollution; tritium; Tritium; degradation; anoxic conditions; CFC; Chlorofluorocarbons; Contaminated sites; Contaminated water; Elevated concentrations; Groundwater ages; Groundwater conditions; Groundwater environment; Groundwater sites; Halon; Mean residence time; oxic conditions; Polyols; reduction; Sulfur hexafluoride","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

General challenges associated with such databases typically involve clustering and bias. However, if information about the horizontal distance to the nearest bedrock outcrop (L) is included, does the spatial estimation of D improve? This idea was tested by comparing two cross-validation results: ordinary kriging (OK) where L was disregarded; and co-kriging (CK) where cross-covariance between D and L was included. The analysis showed only minor differences between OK and CK with respect to differences between estimation and true values. However, the CK results gave in general less estimation variance compared to the OK results. All observations were declustered and transformed to standard normal probability density functions before estimation and back-transformed for the cross-validation analysis. The semivariogram analysis gave correlation lengths for D and L of approx. 10 and 6-km. These correlations reduce the estimation variance in the cross-validation analysis because more than 50% of the data material had two or more observations within a radius of 5km. The small-scale variance of D, however, was about 50% of the total variance, which gave an accuracy of less than 60% for most of the cross-validation cases.

Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5km2) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:30","2018-01-19 22:54:30","","4149-4167","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Rain; Vegetation; Agriculture; Catchments; Forestry; Soil moisture; Moisture; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Evaporation; Eddy covariance towers; Ground based measurement; Meteorological measurements; Meteorological station; Remotely sensed data; Temperature variance; Turbulent flux measurements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of the key factors that affect the risks to urban areas include climate change, the densification of assets within cities and the general expansion of urban areas. In this paper, we examine and compare quantitatively the impact of climate change and recent urban development patterns on the exposure of four European cities to pluvial flooding. In particular, we investigate the degree to which pluvial floods of varying severity and in different geographical locations are influenced to the same extent by changes in urban land cover and climate change. We have selected the European cities of Odense, Vienna, Strasbourg and Nice for analyses to represent different climatic conditions, trends in urban development and topographical characteristics. We develop and apply a combined remote-sensing and flood-modelling approach to simulate the extent of pluvial flooding for a range of extreme precipitation events for historical (1984) and present-day (2014) urban land cover and for two climate-change scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Changes in urban land cover are estimated using Landsat satellite imagery for the period 1984-2014. We combine the remote-sensing analyses with regionally downscaled estimates of precipitation extremes of current and expected future climate to enable 2-D overland flow simulations and flood-hazard assessments. The individual and combined impacts of urban development and climate change are quantified by examining the variations in flooding between the different simulations along with the corresponding uncertainties. In addition, two different assumptions are examined with regards to the development of the capacity of the urban drainage system in response to urban development and climate change. In the ""stationary"" approach, the capacity resembles present-day design, while it is updated in the ""evolutionary"" approach to correspond to changes in imperviousness and precipitation intensities due to urban development and climate change respectively. For all four cities, we find an increase in flood exposure corresponding to an observed absolute growth in impervious surfaces of 7-12% during the past 30 years of urban development. Similarly, we find that climate change increases exposure to pluvial flooding under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The relative importance of urban development and climate change on flood exposure varies considerably between the cities. For Odense, the impact of urban development is comparable to that of climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario (2081-2100), while for Vienna and Strasbourg it is comparable to the impacts of an RCP 4.5 scenario. For Nice, climate change dominates urban development as the primary driver of changes in exposure to flooding. The variation between geographical locations is caused by differences in soil infiltration properties, historical trends in urban development and the projected regional impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation. Developing the capacity of the urban drainage system in relation to urban development is found to be an effective adaptation measure as it fully compensates for the increase in run-off caused by additional sealed surfaces. On the other hand, updating the drainage system according to changes in precipitation intensities caused by climate change only marginally reduces flooding for the most extreme events. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:32","2018-01-19 22:54:32","","4131-4147","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change scenarios; Floods; Remote sensing; Precipitation (meteorology); Urban drainage systems; Urban growth; Precipitation extremes; Drainage; Satellite imagery; Extreme precipitation events; Flood hazard assessment; Geographical locations; Precipitation intensity; Remote sensing analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We produce ensemble forecasts of monthly discharges for 20 large rivers of the world, with lead times of up to 6 months, forcing the system with bias-corrected seasonal meteorological forecast ensembles from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and with probabilistic meteorological ensembles obtained following the ESP procedure.

We use the Brier skill score (BSS) to quantify the skill of the system in forecasting high and low flows, defined as discharges higher than the 75th and lower than the 25th percentiles for a given month, respectively. We determine the theoretical skill by comparing the results against model simulations and the actual skill in comparison to discharge observations. We calculate the ratios of actual-to-theoretical skill in order to quantify the percentage of the potential skill that is achieved. The results suggest that the performance of ECMWF S3 forecasts is close to that of the ESP forecasts.

Here, we apply the comprehensive, distributed model Alpine3D to investigate the role of soil moisture in the predisposition of the Dischma catchment in Switzerland to high flows from rainfall and snowmelt. The recently updated soil module of the physics-based multilayer snow cover model SNOWPACK, which solves the surface energy and mass balance in Alpine3D, is verified against soil moisture measurements at seven sites and various depths inside and in close proximity to the Dischma catchment. Measurements and simulations in such terrain are difficult and consequently, soil moisture was simulated with varying degrees of success. Differences between simulated and measured soil moisture mainly arise from an overestimation of soil freezing and an absence of a groundwater description in the Alpine3D model. Both were found to have an influence in the soil moisture measurements. Using the Alpine3D simulation as the surface scheme for a spatially explicit hydrologic response model using a travel time distribution approach for interflow and baseflow, streamflow simulations were performed for the discharge from the catchment. The streamflow simulations provided a closer agreement with observed streamflow when driving the hydrologic response model with soil water fluxes at 30 cm depth in the Alpine3D model. Performance decreased when using the 2 cm soil water flux, thereby mostly ignoring soil processes. This illustrates that the role of soil moisture is important to take into account when understanding the relationship between both snowpack runoff and rainfall and catchment discharge in high alpine terrain. However, using the soil water flux at 60 cm depth to drive the hydrologic response model also decreased its performance, indicating that an optimal soil depth to include in surface simulations exists and that the runoff dynamics are controlled by only a shallow soil layer. Runoff coefficients (i.e. ratio of rainfall over discharge) based on measurements for high rainfall and snowmelt events were found to be dependent on the simulated initial soil moisture state at the onset of an event, further illustrating the important role of soil moisture for the hydrological processes in the catchment. The runoff coefficients using simulated discharge were found to reproduce this dependency, which shows that the Alpine3D model framework can be successfully applied to assess the predisposition of the catchment to flood risks from both snowmelt and rainfall events. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:37","2018-01-19 22:54:37","","4053-4071","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Risk assessment; Runoff; Snow; catchment; discharge; groundwater; rainfall-runoff modeling; snowpack; soil moisture; streamflow; Risk management; Floods; Groundwater; Catchments; Distributed modeling; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; hydrological response; Soil surveys; Stream flow; Switzerland; Moisture; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Moisture determination; Soil moisture measurement; soil depth; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Streamflow simulations; Soil mechanics; alpine environment; ground freezing; Initial soil moisture; Moisture meters; Simulated discharges; Soil moisture dynamics; Streamflow generations; travel time; Travel time; Travel time distributions; valley glacier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main goal of this study was to predict in detail how changes in air temperature and precipitation will affect streamflow, the thermal habitat of a cold-water fish (the brown trout, Salmo trutta), and the synergistic relationships among these variables at the rear edge of the natural distribution of brown trout. Thirty-one sites in 14 mountain rivers and streams were studied in central Spain. Models of streamflow were built for several of these sites using M5 model trees, and a non-linear regression method was used to estimate stream temperatures. Nine global climate models simulations for Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were downscaled to the local level. Significant reductions in streamflow were predicted to occur in all of the basins (max. -49 %) by the year 2099, and seasonal differences were noted between the basins. The stream temperature models showed relationships between the model parameters, geology and hydrologic responses. Temperature was sensitive to streamflow in one set of streams, and summer reductions in streamflow contributed to additional stream temperature increases (max. 3.6 °C), although the sites that are most dependent on deep aquifers will likely resist warming to a greater degree. The predicted increases in water temperatures were as high as 4.0 °C. Temperature and streamflow changes will cause a shift in the rear edge of the distribution of this species. However, geology will affect the extent of this shift. Approaches like the one used herein have proven to be useful in planning the prevention and mitigation of the negative effects of climate change by differentiating areas based on the risk level and viability of fish populations. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:39","2018-01-19 22:54:39","","4073-4101","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Regression analysis; streamflow; Spain; Global climate model; Hydrogeology; Linear regression; climate change; Fish; Rivers; Climate models; Aquifers; Ecosystems; Aquatic ecosystems; global climate; Fisheries; river basin; precipitation (climatology); climate effect; Stream temperatures; water temperature; hydrological response; population distribution; Population distribution; Stream flow; air temperature; Precipitation patterns; Geology; Seasonal differences; mountain region; edge effect; Hydrologic response; Natural distribution; Non-linear regression method; Salmo trutta; salmonid; Stream temperature models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method acts as a post-processor on deterministic model forecasts and generates a residual uncertainty distribution. Based on instance-based learning, it uses a k nearest-neighbour search for similar historical hydrometeorological conditions to determine uncertainty intervals from a set of historical errors, i.e. discrepancies between past forecast and observation. The performance of this method is assessed using test cases of hydrologic forecasting in two UK rivers: the Severn and Brue. Forecasts in retrospect were made and their uncertainties were estimated using kNN resampling and two alternative uncertainty estimators: quantile regression (QR) and uncertainty estimation based on local errors and clustering (UNEEC). Results show that kNN uncertainty estimation produces accurate and narrow uncertainty intervals with good probability coverage. Analysis also shows that the performance of this technique depends on the choice of search space. Nevertheless, the accuracy and reliability of uncertainty intervals generated using kNN resampling are at least comparable to those produced by QR and UNEEC. It is concluded that kNN uncertainty estimation is an interesting alternative to other post-processors, like QR and UNEEC, for estimating forecast uncertainty. Apart from its concept being simple and well understood, an advantage of this method is that it is relatively easy to implement. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:42","2018-01-19 22:54:42","","4021-4036","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom; streamflow; Uncertainty analysis; probability; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; uncertainty analysis; forecasting method; estimation method; hydrological response; hydrometeorology; learning; England; Nearest neighbor search; Streamflow forecasting; Hydrometeorological conditions; Brue Basin; Deterministic modeling; Hydrologic forecasting; Instance based learning; Severn River [United Kingdom]; Somerset; Uncertainty distributions; Uncertainty estimation; Uncertainty estimators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Favourable environmental conditions for microbiological reduction of perchlorate were sought by infiltrating an electron donor-enriched water solution using drip irrigation underlying an airtight sealing liner. A vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) was used for real-time tracking of the percolation process, the penetration depth of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the variation in perchlorate concentration across the entire soil depth. The experimental conditions for each infiltration event were adjusted according to insight gained from data obtained by the VMS in previous stages. Continuous monitoring of the vadose zone indicated that in the top 13 m of the cross section, perchlorate concentration is dramatically reduced from thousands of milligrams per litre to near-detection limits with a concurrent increase in chloride concentration. Nevertheless, in the deeper parts of the vadose zone (&lt; 17 m), perchlorate concentration increased, suggesting its mobilization down through the cross section. Breakthrough of DOC and bromide at different depths across the unsaturated zone showed limited migration capacity of biologically consumable carbon and energy sources due to their enhanced biodegradation in the upper soil layers. Nevertheless, the increased DOC concentration with concurrent reduction in perchlorate and increase in the chloride-to-perchlorate ratio in the top 13 m indicate partial degradation of perchlorate in this zone. There was no evidence of improved degradation conditions in the deeper parts where the initial concentrations of perchlorate were significantly higher. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:44","2018-01-19 22:54:44","","4011-4020","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","In-situ bioremediation; Environmental conditions; concentration (composition); Groundwater; pollutant transport; experimental study; Biodegradation; tracking; Irrigation; Soils; vadose zone; Organic carbon; biodegradation; microbial activity; Monitoring; ozone; monitoring system; Infiltration; dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; bioremediation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; bromide; Chloride concentrations; Chlorine compounds; drip irrigation; Enhanced biodegradation; Experimental conditions; Inorganic compounds; Microbiological reduction; mobilization; perchlorate; Perchlorate concentration; percolation; Solvents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paddy-rice cultivation during the flood season has been made possible by implementing high-dyke flood defenses and flood control structures. However, there are widespread claims that the high-dyke system has increased water levels in downstream areas. Our study aims at resolving this issue by attributing observed changes in flood characteristics to high-dyke construction and other possible causes. Maximum water levels and duration above the flood alarm level are analysed for gradual trends and step changes at different discharge gauges. Strong and robust increasing trends of peak water levels and duration downstream of the high-dyke areas are found with a step change in 2000/2001, i.e. immediately after the disastrous flood which initiated the high-dyke development. These changes are in contrast to the negative trends detected at stations upstream of the high-dyke areas. This spatially different behaviour of changes in flood characteristics seems to support the public claims. To separate the impact of the high-dyke development from the impact of the other drivers - i.e. changes in the flood hydrograph entering the Mekong Delta, and changes in the tidal dynamics - hydraulic model simulations of the two recent large flood events in 2000 and 2011 are performed. The hydraulic model is run for a set of scenarios whereas the different drivers are interchanged. The simulations reveal that for the central VMD an increase of 9-13cm in flood peak and 15 days in duration can be attributed to high-dyke development. However, for this area the tidal dynamics have an even larger effect in the range of 19-32cm. However, the relative contributions of the three drivers of change vary in space across the delta. In summary, our study confirms the claims that the high-dyke development has raised the flood hazard downstream. However, it is not the only and not the most important driver of the observed changes. It has to be noted that changes in tidal levels caused by sea level rise in combination with the widely observed land subsidence and the temporal coincidence of high water levels and spring tides have even larger impacts. It is recommended to develop flood risk management strategies using the high-dyke areas as retention zones to mitigate the flood hazard downstream.</p>. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:46","2018-01-19 22:54:46","","3991-4010","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","performance assessment; Risk management; Rivers; temporal analysis; Floods; Flood control; Hydraulic models; risk assessment; Hazards; flood control; Sea level; Water levels; hydrograph; water level; Flood risk management; rice; hazard management; Relative contribution; construction; Control structure; cultivation; dike; Downstream areas; Flood characteristics; Flood hydrographs; Land subsidence; Mekong Delta; mitigation; Model simulation; paddy field; Viet Nam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the modeling results are used to inform resource-management decisions, then providing robust estimates of uncertainty in the simulated response is an important consideration. Here we examine the importance of parameterization, a necessarily subjective process, on uncertainty estimates of the simulated hydrologic response of landcover change. Specifically, we applied the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model to a 1.4 km2 watershed in southern Texas to investigate the simulated hydrologic response of brush management (the mechanical removal of woody plants), a discrete land-cover change. The watershed was instrumented before and after brush-management activities were undertaken, and estimates of precipitation, streamflow, and evapotranspiration (ET) are available; these data were used to condition and verify the model. The role of parameterization in brush-management simulation was evaluated by constructing two models, one with 12 adjustable parameters (reduced parameterization) and one with 1305 adjustable parameters (full parameterization). Both models were subjected to global sensitivity analysis as well as Monte Carlo and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) conditioning to identify important model inputs and to estimate uncertainty in several quantities of interest related to brush management. Many realizations from both parameterizations were identified as ""behavioral"" in that they reproduce daily mean streamflow acceptably well according to Nash- Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, percent bias, and coefficient of determination. However, the total volumetric ET difference resulting from simulated brush management remains highly uncertain after conditioning to daily mean streamflow, indicating that streamflow data alone are not sufficient to inform the model inputs that influence the simulated outcomes of brush management the most. Additionally, the reduced-parameterization model grossly underestimates uncertainty in the total volumetric ET difference compared to the full-parameterization model; total volumetric ET difference is a primary metric for evaluating the outcomes of brush management. The failure of the reduced-parameterization model to provide robust uncertainty estimates demonstrates the importance of parameterization when attempting to quantify uncertainty in land-cover change simulations. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:49","2018-01-19 22:54:49","","3975-3989","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; United States; streamflow; land cover; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Parameter estimation; watershed; soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds; Global sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Parameterization; hydrological response; Texas; Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation; Stream flow; Adjustable parameters; Coefficient of determination; Parameterization model; Quantities of interests; Reactor cores; removal experiment; Soil water assessment tool; Uncertainty estimates; woody plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At one endpoint of this continuum are detailed, high-resolution descriptions of small-scale processes that are numerically integrated to larger scales (e.g. catchments). At the other endpoint of the continuum are spatially lumped representations of the system that express the hydrological response via, in the extreme case, a single linear transfer function. Many other models, developed starting from these two contrasting endpoints, plot along this continuum with different degrees of spatial resolutions and process complexities. A better understanding of the respective basis as well as the respective shortcomings of different modelling philosophies has the potential to improve our models. In this paper we analyse several frequently communicated beliefs and assumptions to identify, discuss and emphasize the functional similarity of the seemingly competing modelling philosophies. We argue that deficiencies in model applications largely do not depend on the modelling philosophy, although some models may be more suitable for specific applications than others and vice versa, but rather on the way a model is implemented. Based on the premises that any model can be implemented at any desired degree of detail and that any type of model remains to some degree conceptual, we argue that a convergence of modelling strategies may hold some value for advancing the development of hydrological models. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:51","2018-01-19 22:54:51","","3953-3973","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","hydrology; Hydrological models; hydrological modeling; Catchments; Hydrology; complexity; Process-based models; hydrological response; Hydrological response; spatial resolution; Functional similarity; Linear transfer function; Modelling strategies; Philosophical aspects; philosophy; Process complexity; Small-scale process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has significantly modified hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, artificial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the first detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the first generation of largescale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human-water interface in hydrological models. © Author(s) 2017.

However, a study based only on runoff simulation is not sufficient to discriminate between different model structures. Hence, there is a need to improve hydrological models for specific streamflow signatures (e.g., low and high flow) and multi-variable predictions (e.g., soil moisture, snow and groundwater). This study assesses the impact of model structure on flow simulation and hydrological realism using three versions of a hydrological model called MORDOR: the historical lumped structure and a revisited formulation available in both lumped and semi-distributed structures. In particular, the main goal of this paper is to investigate the relative impact of model equations and spatial discretization on flow simulation, snowpack representation and evapotranspiration estimation. Comparison of the models is based on an extensive dataset composed of 50 catchments located in French mountainous regions. The evaluation framework is founded on a multi-criterion split-sample strategy. All models were calibrated using an automatic optimization method based on an efficient genetic algorithm. The evaluation framework is enriched by the assessment of snow and evapotranspiration modeling against in situ and satellite data. The results showed that the new model formulations perform significantly better than the initial one in terms of the various streamflow signatures, snow and evapotranspiration predictions. The semi-distributed approach provides better calibration-validation performance for the snow cover area, snow water equivalent and runoff simulation, especially for nival catchments. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:56","2018-01-19 22:54:56","","3937-3952","","8","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Snow; catchment; evapotranspiration; optimization; performance assessment; prediction; satellite data; snowpack; streamflow; data set; genetic algorithm; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Groundwater; runoff; comparative study; calibration; Model structures; model test; Catchments; France; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; Genetic algorithms; Flow simulation; flow modeling; Stream flow; Model inter comparisons; Snow water equivalent; mountain region; Automatic optimization; Efficient genetic algorithms; Evapotranspiration modeling; Situ and satellite datum; Spatial discretizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work suggests that the two major avenues to advance seasonal predictability are improvements in the estimation of initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) and the incorporation of climate information. This study investigates the marginal benefits of a variety of methods using IHCs and/or climate information, focusing on seasonal water supply forecasts (WSFs) in five case study watersheds located in the US Pacific Northwest region. We specify two benchmark methods that mimic standard operational approaches &ndash; statistical regression against IHCs and model-based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) &ndash; and then systematically intercompare WSFs across a range of lead times. Additional methods include (i) statistical techniques using climate information either from standard indices or from climate reanalysis variables and (ii) several hybrid/hierarchical approaches harnessing both land surface and climate predictability. In basins where atmospheric teleconnection signals are strong, and when watershed predictability is low, climate information alone provides considerable improvements. For those basins showing weak teleconnections, custom predictors from reanalysis fields were more effective in forecast skill than standard climate indices. ESP predictions tended to have high correlation skill but greater bias compared to other methods, and climate predictors failed to substantially improve these deficiencies within a trace weighting framework. Lower complexity techniques were competitive with more complex methods, and the hierarchical expert regression approach introduced here (hierarchical ensemble streamflow prediction &ndash; HESP) provided a robust alternative for skillful and reliable water supply forecasts at all initialization times. Three key findings from this effort are (1) objective approaches supporting methodologically consistent hindcasts open the door to a broad range of beneficial forecasting strategies; (2) the use of climate predictors can add to the seasonal forecast skill available from IHCs; and (3) sample size limitations must be handled rigorously to avoid over-trained forecast solutions. Overall, the results suggest that despite a rich, long heritage of operational use, there remain a number of compelling opportunities to improve the skill and value of seasonal streamflow predictions. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:54:59","2018-01-19 22:54:59","","3915-3935","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; streamflow; teleconnection; water supply; land surface; statistical analysis; Streamflow prediction; Pacific Northwest; Forecasting; watershed; comparative study; seasonal variation; Water supply; climate prediction; ensemble forecasting; Stream flow; Climate information; Climate predictability; Hierarchical ensemble; hindcasting; Hydrologic conditions; Objective approaches; Statistical regression; Statistical techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last decades new instruments, techniques, and methods have been developed to capture rainfall and hydrological processes at high resolution.

At the same time, new models have been proposed to reproduce hydrological response, based on small-scale representation of urban catchment spatial variability. Despite these efforts, interactions between rainfall variability, catchment heterogeneity, and hydrological response remain poorly understood. This paper presents a review of our current understanding of hydrological processes in urban environments as reported in the literature, focusing on their spatial and temporal variability aspects.

We sampled the upper 20cm of podzolic soils at 5cm intervals in four sites differing in their vegetation (Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and heather (Calluna sp. and Erica Sp)) and aspect. The sites were located within the Bruntland Burn long-term experimental catchment in the Scottish Highlands, a low energy, wet environment. Sampling took place on 11 occasions between September 2015 and September 2016 to capture seasonal variability in isotope dynamics. The pore waters of soil samples were analyzed for their isotopic composition (δ2H and δ18O) with the direct-equilibration method. Our results show that the soil waters in the top soil are, despite the low potential evaporation rates in such northern latitudes, kinetically fractionated compared to the precipitation input throughout the year. This fractionation signal decreases within the upper 15cm resulting in the top 5cm being isotopically differentiated to the soil at 15-20cm soil depth. There are significant differences in the fractionation signal between soils beneath heather and soils beneath Scots pine, with the latter being more pronounced. But again, this difference diminishes within the upper 15cm of soil. The enrichment in heavy isotopes in the topsoil follows a seasonal hysteresis pattern, indicating a lag time between the fractionation signal in the soil and the increase/decrease of soil evaporation in spring/autumn. Based on the kinetic enrichment of the soil water isotopes, we estimated the soil evaporation losses to be about 5 and 10% of the infiltrating water for soils beneath heather and Scots pine, respectively. The high sampling frequency in time (monthly) and depth (5cm intervals) revealed high temporal and spatial variability of the isotopic composition of soil waters, which can be critical, when using stable isotopes as tracers to assess plant water uptake patterns within the critical zone or applying them to calibrate tracer-aided hydrological models either at the plot to the catchment scale. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:04","2018-01-19 22:55:04","","3839-3856","","7","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Potential evaporation; Runoff; United Kingdom; Vegetation; catchment; Hydrological models; climate change; hydrological modeling; Land use; seasonal variation; Catchments; Forestry; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; spatial variation; water storage; land use change; topsoil; Seasonal variability; Isotopes; isotopic fractionation; stable isotope; soil-vegetation interaction; water uptake; isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; soil depth; Evaporation; air-soil interaction; Calluna; coniferous tree; Erica; Experimental catchments; High sampling frequencies; Influence of vegetations; Pinus sylvestris; plant water relations; precipitation (chemistry); Scotland; Temporal and spatial variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contaminated areas often show large spatial variability of nitrate concentration in wells. In this study, we tried to assess whether this spatial variability can be characterized on the basis of land use and standard agricultural practices. Deep soil sampling (10 m) was used to calibrate vertical flow and nitrogen-transport numerical models of the unsaturated zone under different agricultural land uses. Vegetable fields (potato and strawberry) and deciduous orchards (persimmon) in the Sharon area overlying the coastal aquifer of Israel were examined. Average nitrate-nitrogen fluxes below vegetable fields were 210-290 kg ha-1 yr-1 and under deciduous orchards were 110-140 kg ha-1 yr-1. The output water and nitrate-nitrogen fluxes of the unsaturated-zone models were used as input data for a three-dimensional flow and nitratetransport model in the aquifer under an area of 13.3 km2 of agricultural land. The area was subdivided into four agricultural land uses: vegetables, deciduous orchards, citrus orchards, and non-cultivated. Fluxes of water and nitrate-nitrogen below citrus orchards were taken from a previous study in the area. The groundwater flow model was calibrated to well heads by changing the hydraulic conductivity. The nitrate-transport model, which was fed by the abovementioned models of the unsaturated zone, succeeded in reconstructing the average nitrate concentration in the wells. However, this transport model failed in calculating the high concentrations in the most contaminated wells and the large spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer. To reconstruct the spatial variability and enable predictions, nitrate fluxes from the unsaturated zone were multiplied by local multipliers. This action was rationalized by the fact that the high concentrations in some wells cannot be explained by regular agricultural activity and are probably due to malfunctions in the well area. Prediction of the nitrate concentration 40 years in the future with three nitrogen-fertilization scenarios showed that (i) under the ""business as usual"" fertilization scenario, the nitrate concentration (as NO- 3 /will increase on average by 19 mg L-1; (ii) under a scenario of 25% reduction of nitrogen fertilization, the nitrate concentration in the aquifer will stabilize; (iii) with a 50% reduction of nitrogen fertilization, the nitrate concentration will decrease on average by 18 mg L-1. © Author(s) 2017.

Floods are evaluated in terms of three variants on an extremity index that combines discharge values with the spatial extent of flooding. The indices differ in the threshold of the considered maximum discharges; the flood extent is expressed by a length of affected river network. This study demonstrates that using the index with a higher flood discharge limit changes the floods' rankings significantly. It also highlights the high severity events. In general, we detected an increase in the proportion of warm half-year floods when using a higher discharge limit.

We suggest transferring this idea to hydrological systems to separate and analyze their two main characteristics: their form, which is equivalent to the spatial structure and static properties, and their function, equivalent to internal responses and hydrological behavior. While this approach is not particularly new to hydrological field research, we want to employ this concept to explicitly pursue the question of what information is most advantageous to understand a hydrological system. We applied this concept to subsurface flow within a hillslope, with a methodological focus on function: we conducted observations during a natural storm event and followed this with a hillslope-scale irrigation experiment. The results are used to infer hydrological processes of the monitored system. Based on these findings, the explanatory power and conclusiveness of the data are discussed. The measurements included basic hydrological monitoring methods, like piezometers, soil moisture, and discharge measurements. These were accompanied by isotope sampling and a novel application of 2-D time-lapse GPR (ground-penetrating radar). The main finding regarding the processes in the hillslope was that preferential flow paths were established quickly, despite unsaturated conditions. These flow paths also caused a detectable signal in the catchment response following a natural rainfall event, showing that these processes are relevant also at the catchment scale. Thus, we conclude that response observations (dynamics and patterns, i.e., indicators of function) were well suited to describing processes at the observational scale. Especially the use of 2-D time-lapse GPR measurements, providing detailed subsurface response patterns, as well as the combination of stream-centered and hillslope-centered approaches, allowed us to link processes and put them in a larger context. Transfer to other scales beyond observational scale and generalizations, however, rely on the knowledge of structures (form) and remain speculative. The complementary approach with a methodological focus on form (i.e., structure exploration) is presented and discussed in the companion paper by Jackisch et al.(2017). © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:16","2018-01-19 22:55:16","","3727-3748","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; two-dimensional modeling; Catchments; sampling; Soil moisture; Hydrological process; hillslope; hydrological response; subsurface flow; Hydrological monitoring; Hydrological system; Aluminum alloys; Discharge measurements; GPR (ground penetrating radar); ground penetrating radar; Ground penetrating radar systems; Hillslope hydrology; Hydrological fields; Unsaturated condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our investigation of flow-relevant structures and hydrological responses refers to the general interplay of form and function, respectively. To obtain a holistic picture of the subsurface, a large set of different laboratory, exploratory and experimental methods was used at the different scales. For exploration these methods included drilled soil core profiles, in situ measurements of infiltration capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity, and laboratory analyses of soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The irrigation experiments at the plot scale were monitored through a combination of dye tracer, salt tracer, soil moisture dynamics, and 3-D time-lapse ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods. At the hillslope scale the subsurface was explored by a 3-D GPR survey. A natural storm event and an irrigation experiment were monitored by a dense network of soil moisture observations and a cascade of 2-D time-lapse GPR trenches. We show that the shift between activated and non-activated state of the flow paths is needed to distinguish structures from overall heterogeneity. Pedo-physical analyses of point-scale samples are the basis for sub-scale structure inference. At the plot and hillslope scale 3-D and 2-D time-lapse GPR applications are successfully employed as non-invasive means to image subsurface response patterns and to identify flow-relevant paths.

In this opinion paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework for understanding and assessing resilience in coupled socio-hydrological contexts, and encourage debate on the inter-connections between socio-hydrology and resilience. Taking a systems perspective, we argue that resilience is a set of systematic properties with three dimensions: Absorptive, adaptive, and transformative, and contend that socio-hydrological systems can be viewed as various forms of human-water couplings, reflecting different aspects of these interactions. We propose a framework consisting of two parts. The first part addresses the identity of socio-hydrological resilience, answering questions such as ""resilience of what in relation to what"". We identify three existing framings of resilience for different types of human-water systems and subsystems, which have been used in different fields: (1) the water subsystem, highlighting hydrological resilience to anthropogenic hazards; (2) the human subsystem, foregrounding social resilience to hydrological hazards; and (3) the coupled human-water system, exhibiting socio-hydrological resilience. We argue that these three system types and resiliences afford new insights into the clarification and evaluation of different water management challenges. The first two types address hydrological and social states, while the third type emphasises the feedbacks and interactions between human and water components within complex systems subject to internal or external disturbances. In the second part, we focus on resilience management and develop the notion of the ""resilience canvas"", a novel heuristic device to identify possible pathways and to facilitate the design of bespoke strategies for enhancing resilience in the socio-hydrological context. The resilience canvas is constructed by combining absorptive and adaptive capacities as two axes. At the corners of the resulting two-dimensional space are four quadrants which we conceptualise as representing resilient, vulnerable, susceptible, and resistant system states. To address projected change-induced uncertainties, we recommend that efforts now be focused on shifting socio-hydrological systems from resistant towards resilient status. In sum, the novel framework proposed here clarifies the ambiguity inherent in socio-hydrological resilience, and provides a viable basis for further theoretical and practical development.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:23","2018-01-19 22:55:23","","3655-3670","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; design; hydrology; water management; anthropogenic effect; vulnerability; Hazards; nature-society relations; conceptual framework; disturbance; strategic approach; Conceptual frameworks; Hydrological system; perception; Adaptive capacity; External disturbances; Four quadrant; Management challenges; social characteristics; Three dimensions; Two dimensional spaces; Waterworks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating water availability requires integration of hydrologic processes and associated human influences. In this study, we summarize the development and evaluation of an extensible hydrologic model that explicitly integrates water rights to spatially distribute irrigation waters in a semi-arid agricultural region in the western US, using the Envision integrated modeling platform. The model captures both human and biophysical systems, particularly the diversion of water from the Boise River, which is the main water source that supports irrigated agriculture in this region. In agricultural areas, water demand is estimated as a function of crop type and local environmental conditions. Surface water to meet crop demand is diverted from the stream reaches, constrained by the amount of water available in the stream, the water-rights-appropriated amount, and the priority dates associated with particular places of use. Results, measured by flow rates at gaged stream and canal locations within the study area, suggest that the impacts of irrigation activities on the magnitude and timing of flows through this intensively managed system are well captured. The multi-year averaged diverted water from the Boise River matches observations well, reflecting the appropriation of water according to the water rights database. Because of the spatially explicit implementation of surface water diversion, the model can help diagnose places and times where water resources are likely insufficient to meet agricultural water demands, and inform future water management decisions. © Author(s) 2017 Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:26","2018-01-19 22:55:26","","3671-3685","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Water resources; surface water; water availability; water management; Environmental conditions; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Flood control; water resource; Agriculture; Hydrologic modeling; Crops; management practice; Water supply; spatial distribution; Integrated modeling; Irrigation; irrigation system; Surface waters; water use; water demand; semiarid region; Management decisions; biophysics; Surface water resources; Spatiotemporal patterns; International law; Idaho; Biophysical process; Biophysical systems; Boise River; Irrigated agriculture; River diversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach assumes that flood formation is driven by the superimposition of short- and long-term perturbations. The former is given by the short-term meteorological forcing leading to infiltration and/or saturation excess, while the latter is originated by higher-than-usual storage in the catchment. To exploit the above sensitivity to long-term perturbations, a meta-Gaussian model and a data assimilation approach are implemented for updating the flood frequency distribution a season in advance. Accordingly, the peak flow in the flood season is predicted in probabilistic terms by exploiting its dependence on the average flow in the antecedent seasons. We focus on the Po River at Pontelagoscuro and the Danube River at Bratislava. We found that the shape of the flood frequency distribution is noticeably impacted by higher-than-usual flows occurring up to several months earlier.

A solution to the inverse problem for the advection-diffusion equations is then applied to data from two successive gauging stations to simulate flows and solute exchange dynamics after recharge. The study site is the karst conduit network of the Fourbanne aquifer in the French Jura Mountains, which includes two reaches characterizing the network from sinkhole to cave stream to the spring. The model is applied, after separation of the base from the flood components, on discharge and total dissolved solids (TDSs) in order to assess lateral flows and solute concentrations and compare them to help identify water origin. The results showed various lateral contributions in space-between the two reaches located in the unsaturated zone (R1), and in the zone that is both unsaturated and saturated (R2)-as well as in time, according to hydrological conditions. Globally, the two reaches show a distinct response to flood routing, with important lateral inflows on R1 and large outflows on R2. By combining these results with solute exchanges and the analysis of flood routing parameters distribution, we showed that lateral inflows on R1 are the addition of diffuse infiltration (observed whatever the hydrological conditions) and localized infiltration in the secondary conduit network (tributaries) in the unsaturated zone, except in extreme dry periods. On R2, despite inflows on the base component, lateral outflows are observed during floods. This pattern was attributed to the concept of reversal flows of conduit-matrix exchanges, inducing a complex water mixing effect in the saturated zone. From our results we build the functional scheme of the karst system. It demonstrates the impact of the saturated zone on matrix-conduit exchanges in this shallow phreatic aquifer and highlights the important role of the unsaturated zone on storage and transfer functions of the system. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:31","2018-01-19 22:55:31","","3635-3653","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Floods; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; karst hydrology; assessment method; water flow; Diffusion; Landforms; Digital storage; Complex networks; flood; Hydrological condition; Matrix algebra; Spatiotemporal variability; Infiltration; karst; Inverse problems; Total dissolved solids; Advection; advection-diffusion equation; Advection-diffusion equation; Conduit networks; flood routing; Functional scheme; inverse problem; Jura Mountains; Mathematical approach; Partial differential equations; phreatic zone; Solute concentrations; solute transport; Solute transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The history of the <q>pendulum swing</q> for water allocation between the economic development and aquifer environmental health of the system is divided into five eras (i.e., natural, exploitation, degradation and restoration, drought-Triggered deterioration, and returning to equilibrium). The system's evolution was interpreted using the Taiji-Tire model. Over-exploitation was considered as the main cause of aquifer depletion, and the groundwater utilization pattern was affected by the varying groundwater table. The aquifer depletion enhanced community sensitivity toward environmental issues, and upgraded the social productive force for restoration. The evolution of the system was substantially impacted by two droughts. The drought in 1965 induced the system from natural conditions to groundwater exploiting. The drought from 1997 to 2002 resulted in a surge in further groundwater abstraction and dramatic aquifer deterioration, and community sensitivity increased rapidly and induced the social productive force to a tipping point. From then on, the system returns to equilibrium through new policies and water-saving technologies. Along with the establishment of a strict water resource management strategy and the launch of the South-To-North Water Diversion Project, further restoration of groundwater environment was implemented. However, a comprehensive and coordinated drought management plan should be devised to avoid irreversible change in the system.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:33","2018-01-19 22:55:33","","3619-3633","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water management; Water resources; drought; groundwater; water management; Drought; Flood control; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; resource allocation; Water conservation; water use; Waterresource management; water table; North China Plain; Groundwater environment; environmental restoration; Deterioration; economic development; Environmental issues; exploitation; groundwater abstraction; Groundwater abstraction; Groundwater utilization; historical perspective; human evolution; Irreversible changes; resource depletion; Restoration; South-to-North water diversion project; Tectonics; Water saving technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study was initiated by the devastating flood in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, when Hurricane Mitch struck the city. In this study we hypothesized that it is possible to estimate, in a trustworthy way considering large data uncertainties, this extreme 1998 flood discharge and the extent of the inundations that followed from a combination of models and post-event measured data. Post-event data collected in 2000 and 2001 were used to estimate discharge peaks, times of peak, and high-water marks. These data were used in combination with rain data from two gauges to drive and constrain a combination of well-known modelling tools: TOPMODEL, Muskingum-Cunge-Todini routing, and the LISFLOOD-FP hydraulic model. Simulations were performed within the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) uncertainty-analysis framework. The model combination predicted peak discharge, times of peaks, and more than 90ĝ% of the observed high-water marks within the uncertainty bounds of the evaluation data. This allowed an inundation likelihood map to be produced. Observed high-water marks could not be reproduced at a few locations on the floodplain. Identifications of these locations are useful to improve model set-up, model structure, or post-event data-estimation methods. Rainfall data were of central importance in simulating the times of peak and results would be improved by a better spatial assessment of rainfall, e.g. from radar data or a denser rain-gauge network. Our study demonstrated that it was possible, considering the uncertainty in the post-event data, to reasonably reproduce the extreme Mitch flood in Tegucigalpa in spite of no hydrometric gauging during the event. The method proposed here can be part of a Bayesian framework in which more events can be added into the analysis as they become available.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:35","2018-01-19 22:55:35","","3597-3618","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; United States; Model combination; Uncertainty analysis; Floods; Hydraulic models; floodplain; uncertainty analysis; flood control; flood damage; Precipitation (meteorology); extreme event; Digital storage; hazard assessment; peak discharge; Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation; Gages; raingauge; hydrometry; Rain gauge networks; Ohio; mitigation; Flood discharge; Bayesian frameworks; Data estimation; Francisco Morazan; Honduras; Hurricanes; Hydraulic tools; Muskingum River; Spatial assessment; Tegucigalpa; Uncertainty bounds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, which provides the new generation of rainfall estimates, is now considered a global successor to TRMM.

This study uses GPM data provided by the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) (product/final run) as input to a distributed hydrological model for the Amazon Basin of Peru and Ecuador for a 16-month period (from March 2014 to June 2015) when all datasets are available. TRMM products (TMPA V7 and TMPA RT datasets) and a gridded precipitation dataset processed from observed rainfall are used for comparison. The results indicate that precipitation data derived from GPM-IMERG correspond more closely to TMPA V7 than TMPA RT datasets, but both GPM-IMERG and TMPA V7 precipitation data tend to overestimate, compared to observed rainfall (by 11.1 and 15.7 %, respectively). In general, GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT correlate with observed rainfall, with a similar number of rain events correctly detected (∼ 20 %). Statistical analysis of modeled streamflows indicates that GPM-IMERG is as useful as TMPA V7 or TMPA RT datasets in southern regions (Ucayali Basin). GPM-IMERG, TMPA V7 and TMPA RT do not properly simulate streamflows in northern regions (Marañón and Napo basins), probably because of the lack of adequate rainfall estimates in northern Peru and the Ecuadorian Amazon. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:38","2018-01-19 22:55:38","","3543-3555","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; rainfall; satellite data; streamflow; data set; hydrological modeling; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); Stream flow; Rain gages; Rainfall estimates; Satellite retrieval; Distributed hydrological model; TRMM; Amazon Basin; Amazonian region; Ecuador; Global precipitation measurement missions; Peru; Precipitation data; Tropical rainfall measurement missions; Ucayali Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In reality, however, many depressions in the DEM are actual wetland landscape features with seasonal to permanent inundation patterning characterized by nested hierarchical structures and dynamic filling-spilling-merging surface-water hydrological processes. Differentiating and appropriately processing such ecohydrologically meaningful features remains a major technical terrain-processing challenge, particularly as high-resolution spatial data are increasingly used to support modeling and geographic analysis needs. The objectives of this study were to delineate hierarchical wetland catchments and model their hydrologic connectivity using high-resolution lidar data and aerial imagery. The graph-theory-based contour tree method was used to delineate the hierarchical wetland catchments and characterize their geometric and topological properties. Potential hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and streams were simulated using the least-cost-path algorithm. The resulting flow network delineated potential flow paths connecting wetland depressions to each other or to the river network on scales finer than those available through the National Hydrography Dataset.

To achieve this, information on marginal cost curves (MCCs) that rank management packages according to their cost-effectiveness to reduce the WF need to support the decision making. MCCs enable the estimation of the cost associated with a certain WF reduction target, e.g. towards a given WF permit (expressed in m3 ha-1 per season) or to a certain WF benchmark (expressed in m3 t-1 of crop). This paper aims to develop MCCs for WF reduction for a range of selected cases. AquaCrop, a soil-water-balance and crop-growth model, is used to estimate the effect of different management packages on evapotranspiration and crop yield and thus the WF of crop production. A management package is defined as a specific combination of management practices: irrigation technique (furrow, sprinkler, drip or subsurface drip); irrigation strategy (full or deficit irrigation); and mulching practice (no, organic or synthetic mulching). The annual average cost for each management package is estimated as the annualized capital cost plus the annual costs of maintenance and operations (i.e. costs of water, energy and labour). Different cases are considered, including three crops (maize, tomato and potato); four types of environment (humid in UK, sub-humid in Italy, semi-arid in Spain and arid in Israel); three hydrologic years (wet, normal and dry years) and three soil types (loam, silty clay loam and sandy loam). For each crop, alternative WF reduction pathways were developed, after which the most cost-effective pathway was selected to develop the MCC for WF reduction. When aiming at WF reduction one can best improve the irrigation strategy first, next the mulching practice and finally the irrigation technique. Moving from a full to deficit irrigation strategy is found to be a no-regret measure: it reduces the WF by reducing water consumption at negligible yield reduction while reducing the cost for irrigation water and the associated costs for energy and labour. Next, moving from no to organic mulching has a high cost-effectiveness, reducing the WF significantly at low cost. Finally, changing from sprinkler or furrow to drip or subsurface drip irrigation reduces the WF, but at a significant cost. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:45","2018-01-19 22:55:45","","3507-3524","","7","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Italy; United Kingdom; Water management; Spain; water management; Agriculture; decision making; crop production; Crops; Cultivation; management practice; Management practices; Water supply; Cost effectiveness; Irrigation; irrigation system; soil water; benchmarking; water use; Zea mays; cost analysis; Costs; Cost reduction; water footprint; drip irrigation; Israel; Solanum tuberosum; Irrigated agriculture; Cost estimating; Crop water consumption; Deficit irrigation; Lycopersicon esculentum; Maintenance and operation; Marginal cost curves; Soil water balance; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Subirrigation; Subsurface drip irrigation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A high proportion of annual runoff and nutrient transport occurs with snowmelt in this region. Extensive surface drainage modification, frozen soils, and frequent backwater or ice-damming impacts on flow measurement represent unique challenges to accurately modelling watershed-scale hydrological processes. A physically based, non-calibrated model created using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM) was parameterized to simulate hydrological processes within a low slope, clay soil, and intensively surface drained agricultural watershed. These characteristics are common to most tributaries of the Red River of the north. Analysis of the observed water level records for the study watershed (La Salle River) indicates that ice cover and backwater issues at time of peak flow may impact the accuracy of both modelled and measured streamflows, highlighting the value of evaluating a non-calibrated model in this environment. Simulations best matched the streamflow record in years when peak and annual discharges were equal to or above the medians of 6.7gm3gsg'1 and 1.25g × 107gm3, respectively, with an average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.76. Simulation of low-flow years (below the medians) was more challenging (average NSEg &lt; g0), with simulated discharge overestimated by 90g% on average. This result indicates the need for improved understanding of hydrological response in the watershed under drier conditions. Simulation during dry years was improved when infiltration was allowed prior to soil thaw, indicating the potential importance of preferential flow. Representation of in-channel dynamics and travel time under the flooded or ice-jam conditions should also receive attention in further model development efforts. Despite the complexities of the study watershed, simulations of flow for average to high-flow years and other components of the water balance were robust (snow water equivalency (SWE) and soil moisture). A sensitivity analysis of the flow routing model suggests a need for improved understanding of watershed functions under both dry and flooded conditions due to dynamic routing conditions, but overall CRHM is appropriate for simulation of hydrological processes in agricultural watersheds of the Red River. Falsifications of snow sublimation, snow transport, and infiltration to frozen soil processes in the validated base model indicate that these processes were very influential in stream discharge generation. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:47","2018-01-19 22:55:47","","3483-3506","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; Snow; discharge; simulation; streamflow; Rivers; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Floods; flooding; Agriculture; watershed; Water; infiltration; Watersheds; Canada; flow measurement; Hydrology; Water levels; Soil moisture; Soils; Hydrological modelling; hydrological response; Hydrological response; water budget; Ice; Stream flow; snowmelt; Infiltration; peak flow; Frozen soils; ice cover; travel time; Agricultural watersheds; Clay; Cold region hydrologies; Cold regions hydrological model; Great Plains; Infiltration to frozen soil; Northern great plains; Red River [Canada-United States]; Watershed scale hydrological process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept builds on systems theory, and views Earth as a complex adaptive system in which anthropogenic disturbances may trigger nonlinear, abrupt, and irreversible changes at the global scale, and ""push the Earth system outside the stable environmental state of the Holocene"". While the idea has been remarkably successful in both science and policy circles, it has also raised fundamental concerns, as the majority of suggested processes and their corresponding planetary boundaries do not operate at the global scale, and thus apparently lack the potential to trigger abrupt planetary changes. This paper picks up the debate with specific regard to the planetary boundary on ""global freshwater use"". While the bio-physical impacts of excessive water consumption are typically confined to the river basin scale, the PB proponents argue that water-induced environmental disasters could build up to planetary-scale feedbacks and system failures. So far, however, no evidence has been presented to corroborate that hypothesis. Furthermore, no coherent approach has been presented to what extent a planetary threshold value could reflect the risk of regional environmental disaster. To be sure, the PB framework was revised in 2015, extending the planetary freshwater boundary with a set of basin-level boundaries inferred from environmental water flow assumptions. Yet, no new evidence was presented, either with respect to the ability of those basin-level boundaries to reflect the risk of regional regime shifts or with respect to a potential mechanism linking river basins to the planetary scale. So while the idea of a planetary boundary on freshwater use appears intriguing, the line of arguments presented so far remains speculative and implicatory. As long as Earth system science does not present compelling evidence, the exercise of assigning actual numbers to such a boundary is arbitrary, premature, and misleading. Taken as a basis for waterrelated policy and management decisions, though, the idea transforms from misleading to dangerous, as it implies that we can globally offset water-related environmental impacts. A planetary boundary on freshwater use should thus be disapproved and actively refuted by the hydrological and water resources community. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:50","2018-01-19 22:55:50","","3455-3461","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Disasters; Water resources; water management; anthropogenic effect; environmental impact; Environmental impact; Water; Watersheds; global perspective; river basin; freshwater; water use; boundary layer; Management decisions; biophysics; environmental risk; Environmental change; Irreversible changes; Anthropogenic disturbance; Complex adaptive systems; Earth system science; environmental change; Environmental disasters; Environmental water; Systems engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study conducts correlation analysis to calculate how summertime (July-September, JAS) streamflow data derived at 28 upstream and 13 downstream gauges in Taiwan correlate with 14 teleconnection indices in the current or preceding seasons. We find that the western Pacific (WP) and Pacific- Japan (PJ) patterns, both of which play a critical role in determining cyclonic activity in the western North Pacific basin, exhibit the highest concurrent correlations (most significant r D 0:50) with the JAS flows in Taiwan. Alternatively, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) averaged over the period from the previous October to June of the current year is significantly correlated with the JAS flows (most significant r =0:66), indicating some forecasting utility. By further examining the correlation results using a 20-year moving window, peculiar temporal variations and possible climate regime shifts (CRSs) can be revealed. A CRS test is employed to identify suspicious and abrupt changes in the correlation. The late 1970s and 1990s are identified as two significant change points. During the intermediate period, Taiwan's streamflow and the PJ index exhibit a marked inphase relationship (r > 0:8). It is verified that the two shifts are in concordance with the alteration of large-scale circulations in the Pacific basin by investigating the changes in pattern correlation and composite maps before and after the change point. Our results suggest that empirical forecasting techniques should take into account the effect of CRSs on predictor screening. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:53","2018-01-19 22:55:53","","3463-3481","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","atmospheric circulation; catchment; correlation; gauge; streamflow; teleconnection; Climatology; Teleconnection indices; Atmospheric movements; Catchments; temporal variation; Stream flow; annual variation; Pacific Ocean; Western North Pacific; Atmospheric circulation; Climate regime shift; cyclone; Forecasting techniques; Interannual variation; Japan; Large-scale circulation; moisture transfer; Oscillating flow; Pacific Coast [Japan]; Pacific Ocean (West); quasi-biennial oscillation; Quasi-biennial oscillation; Taiwan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SGD flux is a current issue of discussion and a means to clarify the coastal marine system under climate change. SGD flux accounts for about one-quarter of the river runoff in the Katakai alluvial fan in Uozu, Toyama, Japan, which is an ideal area to study SGD flux considering the need for a rapid response to climate change and the prior research on SGD there. In this paper, the monthly groundwater table's condition over 30 years is analyzed using monthly rainfall, snowfall, and the climate change index. Rainfall has been on an upward trend, but the snowfall has decreased over 40 years. Furthermore, the groundwater table at monitoring wells in the coastal area increased, as a result of the increased rainfall. However, the relationship between snowfall and groundwater is negative. As expected by Darcy's law, SGD flux was controlled by the hydraulic gradient of the coastal groundwater. The estimated historic SGD flux by groundwater table variation shows an upward trend of SGD. Considering the increase in precipitation and the groundwater table, SGD flux may increase under climate change. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:55:57","2018-01-19 22:55:57","","3417-3425","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Snow; discharge; groundwater; rainfall; climate change; Groundwater; environmental monitoring; coastal zone; temporal variation; Flow of fluids; Coastal marine systems; water table; flux measurement; Hydraulic gradients; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Ground water table; Japan; alluvial fan; Coastal groundwater; Darcy law; Fresh submarine groundwater discharges; Monthly rainfalls; Submarine groundwater discharge; Submarines; Temporal variation; underwater environment; well water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The illustrated framework is made up of two steps. Firstly, a sequence of analysis with classic methods characterized by low computational cost was executed in both time and frequency domains on detailed field measurements of waves, tides, and currents. After this, some indicators of the hydrodynamic state of the basin were identified and evaluated. Namely, the assessment of the net flow through a connecting channel, the time delay of current peaks between upper and bottom layers, the ratio of peak ebb and peak flood currents and the tidal asymmetry factor exemplify results on the vertical structure of the flow, on the correlation between currents and tide and flood/ebb dominance.

They are also intended for calibration and validation of satellite-based Earth observation and monitoring efforts, such as assessment of evapotranspiration from land and vegetation surfaces using surface energy balance approaches. In this paper, 15 years of Skukuza eddy covariance data, i.e. from 2000 to 2014, were analysed for surface energy balance closure (EBC) and partitioning. The surface energy balance closure was evaluated using the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible (H) and latent heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation (Rn) less soil heat (G)), and the energy balance ratio (EBR). Partitioning of the surface energy during the wet and dry seasons was also investigated, as well as how it is affected by atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and net radiation. After filtering years with low-quality data (2004-2008), our results show an overall mean EBR of 0.93. Seasonal variations of EBR also showed the wet season with 1.17 and spring (1.02) being closest to unity, with the dry season (0.70) having the highest imbalance. Nocturnal surface energy closure was very low at 0.26, and this was linked to low friction velocity during night-time, with results showing an increase in closure with increase in friction velocity. The energy partition analysis showed that sensible heat flux is the dominant portion of net radiation, especially between March and October, followed by latent heat flux, and lastly the soil heat flux, and during the wet season where latent heat flux dominated sensible heat flux. An increase in net radiation was characterized by an increase in both LE and H, with LE showing a higher rate of increase than H in the wet season, and the reverse happening during the dry season. An increase in VPD is correlated with a decrease in LE and increase in H during the wet season, and an increase in both fluxes during the dry season. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:02","2018-01-19 22:56:02","","3401-3415","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; evapotranspiration; land surface; climate change; Drought; vegetation cover; environmental monitoring; Budget control; Climate change impact; EOS; Calibration and validations; Heat flux; latent heat flux; semiarid region; energy balance; Energy balance; satellite imagery; eddy covariance; flux measurement; Environmental Monitoring; South Africa; savanna; site investigation; closure; communication network; Eddy covariance data; Friction; Interfacial energy; Kruger National Park; Latent heat; net radiation; Ordinary least squares regressions; Satellite based Earth observation; sensible heat flux; surface energy; Vapour pressure deficits; Wet and dry seasons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the relatively simple mass balance scheme ensures a good performance of runoff simulation during flood events, the model still has some defects. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture content (SMC) in runoff simulation. In order to add more constraints to the original XAJ model, an energy balance scheme suitable for the XAJ model was developed and coupled with the original mass balance scheme of the XAJ model. The detailed parameterizations of the improved model, XAJ-EB, are presented in the first part of this paper. XAJ-EB employs various meteorological forcing and remote sensing data as input, simulating ET and runoff yield using a more physically based mass-energy balance scheme. In particular, the energy balance is solved by determining the representative equilibrium temperature (RET), which is comparable to land surface temperature (LST). The XAJ-EB was evaluated in the Lushui catchment situated in the middle reach of the Yangtze River basin for the period between 2004 and 2007. Validation using ground-measured runoff data proves that the XAJ-EB is capable of reproducing runoff comparable to the original XAJ model. Additionally, RET simulated by XAJ-EB agreed well with moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-retrieved LST, which further confirms that the model is able to simulate the mass-energy balance since LST reflects the interactions among various processes. The validation results prove that the XAJ-EB model has superior performance compared with the XAJ model and also extends its applicability.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:05","2018-01-19 22:56:05","","3359-3375","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; land surface; remote sensing; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Floods; Flood control; runoff; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; Remote sensing data; MODIS; energy balance; Energy balance; Land surface temperature; climate forcing; Meteorological forcing; surface temperature; Radiometers; Image reconstruction; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite imagery; Equilibrium temperatures; mass balance; Real time flood forecasting; Yangtze Basin; Yangtze River basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study describes an experimental set-up for the simultaneous observation of transpiration rates and all leaf energy balance components under controlled conditions, using an insulated closed loop miniature wind tunnel and artificial leaves with pre-defined and constant diffusive conductance for water vapour. A range of tests documents the above capabilities of the experimental set-up and points to potential improvements. The tests reveal a conceptual flaw in the assumption that leaf temperature can be characterized by a single value, suggesting that even for thin, planar leaves, a temperature gradient between the irradiated and shaded or transpiring and non-Transpiring leaf side can lead to bias when using observed leaf temperatures and fluxes to deduce effective conductances to sensible heat or water vapour transfer. However, comparison of experimental results with an explicit leaf energy balance model revealed only minor effects on simulated leaf energy exchange rates by the neglect of cross-sectional leaf temperature gradients, lending experimental support to our current understanding of leaf gas and energy exchange processes.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:07","2018-01-19 22:56:07","","3377-3400","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","hydrological cycle; Temperature; experimental design; Plants (botany); latent heat flux; energy balance; Energy balance; temperature gradient; Hydrological cycles; Energy balance components; water vapor; Transpiration; sensible heat flux; Controlled conditions; Energy balance models; Energy exchange rate; energy flow; Experimental set up; leaf; Simultaneous observation; Thermal gradients; transpiration; Transpiration rates; Water vapor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, when hydrologic uncertainty is accounted for, the design flood value for a specific return period is no longer a unique value, but is represented by a distribution of values. As a consequence, the design flood is no longer univocally defined, making the design process undetermined. The Uncertainty Compliant Design Flood Estimation (UNCODE) procedure is a novel approach that, starting from a range of possible design flood estimates obtained in uncertain conditions, converges to a single design value. This is obtained through a cost-benefit criterion with additional constraints that is numerically solved in a simulation framework. This paper contributes to promoting a practical use of the UNCODE procedure without resorting to numerical computation. A modified procedure is proposed by using a correction coefficient that modifies the standard (i.e., uncertainty-free) design value on the basis of sample length and return period only. The procedure is robust and parsimonious, as it does not require additional parameters with respect to the traditional uncertainty-free analysis. Simple equations to compute the correction term are provided for a number of probability distributions commonly used to represent the flood frequency curve. The UNCODE procedure, when coupled with this simple correction factor, provides a robust way to manage the hydrologic uncertainty and to go beyond the use of traditional safety factors. With all the other parameters being equal, an increase in the sample length reduces the correction factor, and thus the construction costs, while still keeping the same safety level. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:10","2018-01-19 22:56:10","","3353-3358","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","hydrology; Uncertainty analysis; probability; Floods; numerical method; analytical method; uncertainty analysis; Probability distributions; estimation method; infrastructure planning; return period; correction; safety; flood frequency; Correction coefficients; Correction factors; Cost-benefit criterion; Design; design flood; Flood frequency curve; hydraulic structure; Hydrologic uncertainty; Numerical computations; Safety factor; Simulation framework; Uncertain condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While distributed models require many parameters to describe a system, they are expected to simulate behavior that is more consistent with observed processes. However, obtaining a single set of acceptable parameters can be problematic, as parameter equifinality often results in several ""behavioral"" sets that fit observations (typically streamflow). In this study, we investigate the extent to which equifinality impacts a typical distributed modeling application. We outline a hierarchical approach to reduce the number of behavioral sets based on regional, observation-driven, and expert-knowledge-based constraints. For our application, we explore how each of these constraint classes reduced the number of ""behavioral"" parameter sets and altered distributions of spatiotemporal simulations, simulating a well-studied headwater catchment, Stringer Creek, Montana, using the distributed hydrology-soil-vegetation model (DHSVM). As a demonstrative exercise, we investigated model performance across 10 000 parameter sets. Constraints on regional signatures, the hydrograph, and two internal measurements of snow water equivalent time series reduced the number of behavioral parameter sets but still left a small number with similar goodness of fit. This subset was ultimately further reduced by incorporating pattern expectations of groundwater table depth across the catchment. Our results suggest that utilizing a hierarchical approach based on regional datasets, observations, and expert knowledge to identify behavioral parameter sets can reduce equifinality and bolster more careful application and simulation of spatiotemporal processes via distributed modeling at the catchment scale. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:12","2018-01-19 22:56:12","","3325-3352","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Snow; United States; catchment; groundwater; data set; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; spatiotemporal analysis; Catchments; Knowledge based systems; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; headwater; Behavioral parameters; Distributed hydrology soil vegetation models; Groundwater table depth; Hierarchical approach; Montana; Process understanding; Spatio-temporal simulation; Spatiotemporal process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there have been a number of soil moisture products, they cannot be directly used in hydrological modelling. This paper attempts for the first time to build a soil moisture product directly applicable to hydrology using multiple data sources retrieved from SAC-SMA (soil moisture), MODIS (land surface temperature), and SMOS (multi-angle brightness temperatures in H-V polarisations). The simple yet effective local linear regression model is applied for the data fusion purpose in the Pontiac catchment. Four schemes according to temporal availabilities of the data sources are developed, which are pre-assessed and best selected by using the well-proven feature selection algorithm gamma test. The hydrological accuracy of the produced soil moisture data is evaluated against the Xinanjiang hydrological model's soil moisture deficit simulation. The result shows that a superior performance is obtained from the scheme with the data inputs from all sources (NSE = D0.912, r = D0.960, RMSED=0.007 m). Additionally, the final daily-available hydrological soil moisture product significantly increases the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency by almost 50%in comparison with the two most popular soil moisture products. The proposed method could be easily applied to other catchments and fields with high confidence.

In addition, we developed a one-dimensional predictive equation for the dispersion of salinity as a function of local hydraulic parameters that can vary along the estuary axis, including mixing due to tide-driven residual circulation. This type of mixing is relevant in the wider part of alluvial estuaries where preferential ebb and flood channels appear. Subsequently, this dispersion equation is combined with the salt balance equation to obtain a new predictive analytical equation for the longitudinal salinity distribution. Finally, the new equation was tested and applied to a large database of observations in alluvial estuaries, whereby the calibrated <i>K</i> values appeared to correspond well to the theoretical range.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:17","2018-01-19 22:56:17","","3287-3305","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","database; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; one-dimensional modeling; empirical analysis; flood; Mixing; Saline water; Salinity distributions; Hydraulic parameters; Estuaries; Dispersions; estuarine environment; Analytical equations; Dispersion equations; Empirical equations; physics; Predictive equations; Residual circulations; Saline water intrusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analogy is generally assessed on gradients of geopotential heights first to sample days with a similar atmospheric circulation. Other predictors such as moisture variables can also be added in a successive level of analogy. The search for candidate situations similar to a given target day is usually undertaken by comparing the state of the atmosphere at fixed hours of the day for both the target day and the candidate analogues. This is a consequence of using standard daily precipitation time series, which are available over longer periods than sub-daily data. However, it is unlikely for the best analogy to occur at the exact same hour for the target and candidate situations. A better analogue situation may be found with a time shift of several hours since a better fit can occur at different times of the day. In order to assess the potential for finding better analogues at a different hour, a moving time window (MTW) has been introduced. The MTW resulted in a better analogy in terms of the atmospheric circulation and showed improved values of the analogy criterion on the entire distribution of the extracted analogue dates. The improvement was found to increase with the analogue rank due to an accumulation of better analogues in the selection. A seasonal effect has also been identified, with larger improvements shown in winter than in summer. This may be attributed to stronger diurnal cycles in summer that favour predictors taken at the same hour for the target and analogue days. The impact of the MTW on the precipitation prediction skill has been assessed by means of a sub-daily precipitation series transformed into moving 24h totals at 12, 6, and 3h time steps. The prediction skill was improved by the MTW, as was the reliability of the prediction. Moreover, the improvements were greater for days with heavy precipitation, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations in which the timing is more specific and for which fewer records are available in the meteorological archive. The improvements of the analogy criterion and the performance scores on precipitation were both found to be higher for MTWs with a smaller time step of 3h. A 3h MTW provides 8 times more candidate situations even though they are not fully independent. Since the MTW provides additional situations to the pool of possible analogues, it can be considered as an inflation of the meteorological archive. Because this technique is simple and easily applicable, it should be considered for several applications in different contexts, such as operational forecasting or climate-related studies.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:19","2018-01-19 22:56:19","","3307-3323","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","atmospheric circulation; prediction; Climatology; Forecasting; Meteorology; meteorology; Operational forecasting; precipitation assessment; Daily precipitations; diurnal variation; precipitation intensity; Atmospheric circulation; acid precipitation; Atmospheric situations; Geo-potential heights; geopotential; Heavy precipitation; Precipitation predictions; Statistical relationship; weather modification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few studies have quantified glacier melt contribution to streamflow in this region. To address this shortcoming, we present an analysis of meteorological conditions and ablation for Universidad Glacier, one of the largest valley glaciers in the central Andes of Chile at the head of the Tinguiririca River, for the 2009-2010 ablation season. We used meteorological measurements from two automatic weather stations installed on the glacier to drive a distributed temperature-index and runoff routing model. The temperature-index model was calibrated at the lower weather station site and showed good agreement with melt estimates from an ablation stake and sonic ranger, and with a physically based energy balance model. Total modelled glacier melt is compared with river flow measurements at three sites located between 0.5 and 50 km downstream. Universidad Glacier shows extremely high melt rates over the ablation season which may exceed 10 m water equivalent in the lower ablation area, representing between 10 and 13 % of the mean monthly streamflow at the outlet of the Tinguiririca River Basin between December 2009 and March 2010. This contribution rises to a monthly maximum of almost 20 % in March 2010, demonstrating the importance of glacier runoff to streamflow, particularly in dry years such as 2009-2010. The temperature-index approach benefits from the availability of on-glacier meteorological data, enabling the calculation of the local hourly variable lapse rate, and is suited to high melt regimes, but would not be easily applicable to glaciers further north in Chile where sublimation is more significant. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:21","2018-01-19 22:56:21","","3249-3266","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Water resources; river flow; streamflow; temperature; Chile; Rivers; Weather forecasting; Meteorology; runoff; Meteorological data; Digital storage; Stream flow; energy balance; Temperature index models; index method; Andes; Atmospheric temperature; Meteorological condition; ablation; Ablation; Meteorological measurements; valley glacier; Energy balance models; Automatic weather stations; glacier dynamics; melt; O'Higgins; River flow measurement; Temperature index; Tinguiririca River; Weather information services; weather station","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the effect of climate change and variability on stream temperature is a major scientific and practical concern. This paper aims (1) to improve the understanding of large-scale spatial and temporal variability in climate- water temperature associations, and (2) to assess explicitly the influence of basin properties as modifiers of these relationships. A dataset was assembled including six distinct modelled climatic variables (air temperature, downward short-wave and long-wave radiation, wind speed, specific humidity, and precipitation) and observed stream temperatures for the period 1984-2007 at 35 sites located on 21 rivers within 16 basins (Great Britain geographical extent); the study focuses on broad spatio-temporal patterns, and hence was based on 3-month-averaged data (i.e. seasonal). A wide range of basin properties was derived. Five models were fitted (all seasons, winter, spring, summer, and autumn). Both site and national spatial scales were investigated at once by using multi-level modelling with linear multiple regressions. Model selection used multi-model inference, which provides more robust models, based on sets of good models, rather than a single best model. Broad climate-water temperature associations common to all sites were obtained from the analysis of the fixed coefficients, while site-specific responses, i.e. random coefficients, were assessed against basin properties with analysis of variance (ANOVA). All six climate predictors investigated play a role as a control of water temperature. Air temperature and short-wave radiation are important for all models/seasons, while the other predictors are important for some models/seasons only. The form and strength of the climate-stream temperature association vary depending on season and on water temperature. The dominating climate drivers and physical processes may change across seasons and across the stream temperature range. The role of basin permeability, size, and elevation as modifiers of the climate- water temperature associations was confirmed; permeability has the primary influence, followed by size and elevation. Smaller, upland, and/or impermeable basins are the most influenced by atmospheric heat exchanges, while larger, lowland and permeable basins are the least influenced. The study showed the importance of accounting properly for the spatial and temporal variability of climate-stream temperature associations and their modification by basin properties. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:24","2018-01-19 22:56:24","","3231-3247","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United Kingdom; Water resources; prediction; streamflow; data set; climate change; Temperature; Rivers; spatiotemporal analysis; seasonal variation; river basin; river water; variance analysis; climate effect; Stream temperatures; water temperature; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric humidity; Short-wave radiation; Spatial and temporal variability; Long-wave radiation; Spatiotemporal patterns; Linear multiple regression; Multi-model inference; permeability; Process control; Random coefficients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A series of simulations were made with two replications for each treatment with measurements of runoff rate, velocity, rock cover, and surface roughness. Velocities measured at the end of each experiment were a unique function of discharge rates, independent of slope gradient or rainfall intensity. Physical surface roughness was greater at steeper slopes. The data clearly showed that there was no unique hydraulic coefficient for a given slope, surface condition, or rainfall rate, with hydraulic roughness greater at steeper slopes and lower intensities.

Various combinations of non-structural and structural flood risk reduction options are available to communities. Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it, developing risk management plans is required but often overlooks public perception of a threat. The perception of risk varies in many different ways, especially between the authorities and the affected public. It is because of this disconnection that many risk management plans concerning floods have failed in the past. This paper examines the private adaptation capacity and willingness with respect to flooding in two different catchments in Greece prone to multiple flood events during the last 20 years. Two studies (East Attica and Evros) were carried out, comprised of a survey questionnaire of 155 and 157 individuals, from a peri-urban (East Attica) and a rural (Evros) area, respectively, and they focused on those vulnerable to periodic (rural area) and flash floods (peri-urban area). Based on the comparisons drawn from these responses, and identifying key issues to be addressed when flood risk management plans are implemented, improvements are being recommended for the social dimension surrounding such implementation. As such, the paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on human-environment interaction in socio-hydrology. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:29","2018-01-19 22:56:29","","3183-3198","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Greece; Risk management; Risk perception; Floods; flooding; Flood control; risk assessment; nature-society relations; Human-environment interaction; Catchments; flood damage; Hydrology; Flood risk management; hazard management; Rural areas; Surveys; risk perception; Attica; Eastern Macedonia and Thrace; Evros; Flood risk reduction; Non-structural; Peri-urban areas; Public perception; Risk management plans; Social dimensions; willingness to pay","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several approaches can be developed to increase the quality and availability of data in these poorly gauged or ungauged river basins; among them, the use of Earth observations products has recently become promising. Earth observations of various environmental variables can be used potentially to increase knowledge about the hydrological processes in the basin and to improve streamflow model estimates, via assimilation or calibration. The present study aims to calibrate the large-scale hydrological model PCRaster GLOBal Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) using satellite-based products of evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the Moroccan Oum er Rbia River basin. Daily simulations at a spatial resolution of 5-5 arcmin are performed with varying parameters values for the 32-year period 1979- 2010. Five different calibration scenarios are inter-compared: (i) reference scenario using the hydrological model with the standard parameterization, (ii) calibration using in situobserved discharge time series, (iii) calibration using the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) actual evapotranspiration time series, (iv) calibration using ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) surface soil moisture time series and (v) step-wise calibration using GLEAM actual evapotranspiration and ESA CCI surface soil moisture time series. The impact on discharge estimates of precipitation in comparison with model parameters calibration is investigated using three global precipitation products, including ERA-Interim (EI), WATCH Forcing methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI) and Multi- Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation data by merging gauge, satellite and reanalysis data (MSWEP). Results show that GLEAM evapotranspiration and ESA CCI soil moisture may be used for model calibration resulting in reasonable discharge estimates (NSE values from 0.5 to 0.75), although better model performance is achieved when the model is calibrated with in situ streamflow observations. Independent calibration based on only evapotranspiration or soil moisture observations improves model predictions to a lesser extent. Precipitation input affects discharge estimates more than calibrating model parameters. The use of WFDEI precipitation leads to the lowest model performances. Apart from the in situ discharge calibration scenario, the highest discharge improvement is obtained when EI and MSWEP precipitation products are used in combination with a step-wise calibration approach based on evapotranspiration and soil moisture observations. This study opens up the possibility of using globally available Earth observations and reanalysis products of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture in large-scale hydrological models to estimate discharge at a river basin scale. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:32","2018-01-19 22:56:32","","3125-3144","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Morocco; Time series; Water resources; discharge; evapotranspiration; performance assessment; satellite data; soil moisture; streamflow; Rivers; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Parameter estimation; Climate models; Satellites; Information management; calibration; Watersheds; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; Large scale hydrological model; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; Soils; time series; precipitation (climatology); spatial resolution; Stream flow; Actual evapotranspiration; Moisture; Precipitation products; Observatories; Environmental variables; Hydrometeorological data; Oum er Rbia River; Surface soil moisture; Water resources assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hydrological complexity of the basin, tied with the lack of hydrometeorological data, means that most hydrological studies in the region are either restricted to small subbasins where there are relatively better hydrometeorological data available, or on the whole-basin scale but at very coarse timescales and spatial resolutions. In this study we develop a methodology that can improve the state of the art by using available, but sparse, hydrometeorological data and satellite products to obtain the estimates of all the components of the hydrological cycle (precipitation, evapotranspiration, discharge, and storage). To obtain the water-budget closure, we use the JGrass-NewAge system and various remote sensing products. The satellite product SM2R-CCI is used for obtaining the rainfall inputs, SAF EUMETSAT for cloud cover fraction for proper net radiation estimation, GLEAM for comparison with NewAge-estimated evapotranspiration, and GRACE gravimetry data for comparison of the total water storage amounts available in the whole basin. Results are obtained at daily time steps for the period 1994-2009 (16 years), and they can be used as a reference for any water resource development activities in the region. The overall water-budget analysis shows that precipitation of the basin is 1360-230mm per year.

Here, we present the first field deployment of an iGrav superconducting gravimeter (SG) in a minimized enclosure for long-term integrative monitoring of water storage changes. Results of the field SG on a grassland site under wet-temperate climate conditions were compared to data provided by a nearby SG located in the controlled environment of an observatory building. The field system proves to provide gravity time series that are similarly precise as those of the observatory SG. At the same time, the field SG is more sensitive to hydrological variations than the observatory SG. We demonstrate that the gravity variations observed by the field setup are almost independent of the depth below the terrain surface where water storage changes occur (contrary to SGs in buildings), and thus the field SG system directly observes the total water storage change, i.e., the water balance, in its surroundings in an integrative way. We provide a framework to single out the water balance components actual evapotranspiration and lateral subsurface discharge from the gravity time series on annual to daily timescales. With about 99 and 85% of the gravity signal due to local water storage changes originating within a radius of 4000 and 200m around the instrument, respectively, this setup paves the road towards gravimetry as a continuous hydrological field-monitoring technique at the landscape scale. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:36","2018-01-19 22:56:36","","3167-3182","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; evapotranspiration; water storage; Digital storage; landscape change; Spatial heterogeneity; water budget; Actual evapotranspiration; grassland; gravimetry; climate conditions; Water balance components; Observatories; Hydrological fields; Controlled environment; Enclosures; Gravimeters; Superconducting gravimeter; Temperate climate; Water and energies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It consists of six entirely automated soil moisture stations distributed along an altitudinal gradient between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps, ranging from 1205 to 3410ĝ€mĝ€a.s.l. in elevation.

Fractured sedimentary bedrock can exhibit variable groundwater residence times, anisotropic flow paths, and heterogeneity, along with diffusive exchange between fractures and rock matrix. These properties of the rock will affect thermal transients in the riverbed and groundwater-surface water exchange. In this study, surface electrical methods were used as a non-invasive technique to assess the scale and temporal variability of riverbed temperature and groundwater-surface water interaction beneath a sedimentary bedrock riverbed. Conditions were monitored at a semi-daily to semi-weekly interval over a full annual period that included a seasonal freeze-thaw cycle. Surface electromagnetic induction (EMI) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) methods captured conditions beneath the riverbed along a pool-riffle sequence of the Eramosa River in Canada. Geophysical datasets were accompanied by continuous measurements of aqueous specific conductance, temperature, and river stage. Time-lapse vertical temperature trolling within a lined borehole adjacent to the river revealed active groundwater flow zones along fracture networks within the upper 10ĝ€m of rock. EMI measurements collected during cooler high-flow and warmer low-flow periods identified a spatiotemporal riverbed response that was largely dependent upon riverbed morphology and seasonal groundwater temperature. Time-lapse ERT profiles across the pool and riffle sequence identified seasonal transients within the upper 2 and 3ĝ€m of rock, respectively, with spatial variations controlled by riverbed morphology (pool versus riffle) and dominant surficial rock properties (competent versus weathered rock rubble surface). While the pool and riffle both exhibited a dynamic resistivity through seasonal cooling and warming cycles, conditions beneath the pool were more variable, largely due to the formation of river ice during the winter season. We show that surface electrical resistivity methods have the capacity to detect and resolve electrical resistivity transience beneath a fractured bedrock riverbed in response to porewater temperature and specific conductance fluctuations over a complete annual cycle. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:42","2018-01-19 22:56:42","","3105-3123","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; Rivers; Groundwater flow; fluvial geomorphology; Groundwater; Canada; groundwater flow; Continuous measurements; Lakes; Surface waters; temporal variation; river bed; water temperature; Ontario [Canada]; bedrock; sedimentary rock; Sedimentary rocks; groundwater-surface water interaction; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; freeze-thaw cycle; Complete annual cycles; Electric conductivity; Electrical resistivity methods; Electromagnetic induction; Electromagnetic inductions (EMI); Eramosa River; Fracture; fracture network; geomorphological response; Ground water-surface water interactions; Groundwater temperatures; Groundwater-surface-water exchanges; nondestructive testing; pool-riffle sequence; river ice; rock property; Rocks; Sedimentology; Transients; water exchange","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

FDCs have had broad applications across both operational and research hydrology for decades; however, modeling FDCs has proven elusive. Daily streamflow is a complex time series with flow values ranging over many orders of magnitude. The identification of a probability distribution that can approximate daily streamflow would improve understanding of the behavior of daily flows and the ability to estimate FDCs at ungaged river locations. Comparisons of modeled and empirical FDCs at nearly 400 unregulated, perennial streams illustrate that the four-parameter kappa distribution provides a very good representation of daily streamflow across the majority of physiographic regions in the conterminous United States (US). Further, for some regions of the US, the three-parameter generalized Pareto and lognormal distributions also provide a good approximation to FDCs. Similar results are found for the period of record FDCs, representing the long-term hydrologic regime at a site, and median annual FDCs, representing the behavior of flows in a typical year. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:46","2018-01-19 22:56:46","","3093-3103","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Flow duration curve; United States; streamflow; time series analysis; probability; Probability distributions; flow measurement; Pareto principle; frequency analysis; Stream flow; hydrological regime; Orders of magnitude; Broad application; Complex time series; Hydrologic regime; Kappa distribution; Log-normal distribution; Physiographic regions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It requires an extensive investigation into the changing patterns of the checks and balances behind the maintenance of food security at the expense of depleting groundwater, along with high energy consumption. Here we present a comprehensive set of analyses which assess the present status of the water-food-energy nexus in India, along with its changing pattern, in the last few decades. We find that with the growth of population and consequent increase in the food demands, the food production has also increased, and this has been made possible with the intensification of irrigation. However, during the recent decade (after 1996), the increase in food production has not been sufficient to meet its growing demands, precipitating a decline in the per-capita food availability. We also find a statistically significant declining trend of groundwater storage in India during the last decade, as derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite datasets. Regional studies reveal contrasting trends between northern and western-central India. North-western India and the middle Ganga basin show a decrease in the groundwater storage as opposed to an increasing storage over western-central India. Comparison with well data reveals that the highest consistency of GRACE-derived storage data with available well measurements is in the middle Ganga basin. After analysing the data for the last 2 decades, we further showcase that, after a drought, the groundwater storage drops but is unable to recover to its original condition even after good monsoon years. The groundwater storage reveals a very strong negative correlation with the electricity consumption for agricultural usage, which may also be considered as a proxy for groundwater pumped for irrigation in a region. The electricity usage for agricultural purposes has an increasing trend and, interestingly, it does not have any correlation with the monsoon rainfall as computed with the original or de-trended variables. This reveals an important finding that the irrigation has been intensified irrespective of rainfall. This also resulted in a decreasing correlation between the food production and monsoon rainfall, revealing the increasing dependency of agricultural activities on irrigation. We conclude that irrigation has now become essential for agriculture to meet the food demand; however, it should be judiciously regulated and controlled, based on the water availability from monsoon rainfall, specifically after the drought years, as it is essential to recover from the deficits suffered previously. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:49","2018-01-19 22:56:49","","3041-3060","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; drought; groundwater; rainfall; satellite data; water availability; GRACE; Drought; Groundwater; Agriculture; Food supply; Recovery; Water conservation; food security; Irrigation; irrigation system; water storage; Digital storage; Population statistics; India; food availability; demand analysis; Atmospheric thermodynamics; food production; population growth; Negative correlation; Geodetic satellites; Groundwater storage; Ganges Basin; Water availability; Agricultural activities; Agricultural purpose; Electric power utilization; Electricity-consumption; energy use; Energy utilization; Gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites; High energy consumption; population density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to further probe the mechanisms in peat bog areas and contextualize them at the catchment scale, this experimental study identifies runoff formation at two opposite hillslopes in a peaty mountain headwater; a slope with organic peat soils and a shallow phreatic zone (0.5 m below surface), and a slope with mineral Podzol soils and no detectable groundwater (> 2 m below surface). Similarities and differences in infiltration, percolation and preferential flow paths between both hillslopes could be identified by sprinkling experiments with Brilliant Blue and Fluorescein sodium. To our knowledge, this is the first time these two dyes have been compared in their ability to stain preferential flow paths in soils. Dye-stained soil profiles within and downstream of the sprinkling areas were excavated parallel (lateral profiles) and perpendicular (frontal profiles) to the slopes' gradients. That way preferential flow patterns in the soil could be clearly identified. The results show that biomat flow, shallow subsurface flow in the organic topsoil layer, occurred at both hillslopes; however, at the peat bog hillslope it was significantly more prominent. The dye solutions infiltrated into the soil and continued either as lateral subsurface pipe flow in the case of the peat bog, or percolated vertically towards the bedrock in the case of the Podzol. This study provides evidence that subsurface pipe flow, lateral preferential flow along decomposed tree roots or logs in the unsaturated zone, is a major runoff formation process at the peat bog hillslope and in the adjacent riparian zone. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:54","2018-01-19 22:56:54","","3025-3040","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; hydrological cycle; climate change; Groundwater flow; Preferential flows; Groundwater; runoff; Catchments; experimental study; Forestry; identification method; Soils; Landforms; riparian zone; hillslope; subsurface flow; Wetlands; Changing climate; Peat; peatland; mountain region; headwater; Solvents; Hydrologic cycles; dye; Dye stained soils; Dyes; Fluorescein sodiums; Formation process; latitude; Pipe flow; Shallow subsurface; Unsaturated zone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we analyze the hydrological footprint (dynamic development over space and time) of the drought of 2015 in terms of both severity (magnitude) and spatial extent and compare it to the extreme drought of 2003. Analyses are based on a range of low flow and hydrological drought indices derived for about 800 streamflow records across Europe, collected in a community effort based on a common protocol. We compare the hydrological footprints of both events with the meteorological footprints, in order to learn from similarities and differences of both perspectives and to draw conclusions for drought management. The region affected by hydrological drought in 2015 differed somewhat from the drought of 2003, with its center located more towards eastern Europe. In terms of low flow magnitude, a region surrounding the Czech Republic was the most affected, with summer low flows that exhibited return intervals of 100 years and more. In terms of deficit volumes, the geographical center of the event was in southern Germany, where the drought lasted a particularly long time. A detailed spatial and temporal assessment of the 2015 event showed that the particular behavior in these regions was partly a result of diverging wetness preconditions in the studied catchments. Extreme droughts emerged where preconditions were particularly dry. In regions with wet preconditions, low flow events developed later and tended to be less severe. For both the 2003 and 2015 events, the onset of the hydrological drought was well correlated with the lowest flow recorded during the event (low flow magnitude), pointing towards a potential for early warning of the severity of streamflow drought. Time series of monthly drought indices (both streamflow- and climate-based indices) showed that meteorological and hydrological events developed differently in space and time, both in terms of extent and severity (magnitude). These results emphasize that drought is a hazard which leaves different footprints on the various components of the water cycle at different spatial and temporal scales. The difference in the dynamic development of meteorological and hydrological drought also implies that impacts on various water-use sectors and river ecology cannot be informed by climate indices alone. Thus, an assessment of drought impacts on water resources requires hydrological data in addition to drought indices based solely on climate data. The transboundary scale of the event also suggests that additional efforts need to be undertaken to make timely pan-European hydrological assessments more operational in the future. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:56:57","2018-01-19 22:56:57","","3001-3024","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Drought management; Germany; Water resources; catchment; drought; low flow; streamflow; Czech Republic; Drought; spatiotemporal analysis; Catchments; early warning system; extreme event; return period; Stream flow; hazard management; Hydrological events; index method; Hydrological droughts; Spatial and temporal scale; Streamflow records; water footprint; Dynamic development; Hydrological assessment; Temporal assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work large-eddy simulations are used to demonstrate that the CCE appears more generally in canopy turbulence. It is indeed a generic feature of canopy turbulence: rH of a canopy is found to reduce with increasing unstable stratification, which effectively increases the aerodynamic roughness for the same physical roughness of the canopy. This relation offers a sufficient condition to construct a general description of the CCE. In addition, we review existing parameterizations for rH from the evapotranspiration literature and test to what extent they are able to capture the CCE, thereby exploring the possibility of an improved parameterization.

Numerous studies have shown that ensemble forecasts are of higher quality than deterministic ones. Many studies also conclude that decisions based on ensemble rather than deterministic forecasts lead to better decisions in the context of flood mitigation. Hence, it is believed that ensemble forecasts possess a greater economic and social value for both decision makers and the general population. However, the vast majority of, if not all, existing hydro-economic studies rely on a cost-loss ratio framework that assumes a risk-neutral decision maker. To overcome this important flaw, this study borrows from economics and evaluates the economic value of early warning flood systems using the well-known Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) utility function, which explicitly accounts for the level of risk aversion of the decision maker. This new framework allows for the full exploitation of the information related to a forecasts' uncertainty, making it especially suited for the economic assessment of ensemble or probabilistic forecasts. Rather than comparing deterministic and ensemble forecasts, this study focuses on comparing different types of ensemble forecasts. There are multiple ways of assessing and representing forecast uncertainty. Consequently, there exist many different means of building an ensemble forecasting system for future streamflow. One such possibility is to dress deterministic forecasts using the statistics of past error forecasts. Such dressing methods are popular among operational agencies because of their simplicity and intuitiveness. Another approach is the use of ensemble meteorological forecasts for precipitation and temperature, which are then provided as inputs to one or many hydrological model(s). In this study, three concurrent ensemble streamflow forecasting systems are compared: simple statistically dressed deterministic forecasts, forecasts based on meteorological ensembles, and a variant of the latter that also includes an estimation of state variable uncertainty. This comparison takes place for the Montmorency River, a small flood-prone watershed in southern central Quebec, Canada. The assessment of forecasts is performed for lead times of 1 to 5 days, both in terms of forecasts' quality (relative to the corresponding record of observations) and in terms of economic value, using the new proposed framework based on the CARA utility function. It is found that the economic value of a forecast for a risk-Averse decision maker is closely linked to the forecast reliability in predicting the upper tail of the streamflow distribution. Hence, post-processing forecasts to avoid over-forecasting could help improve both the quality and the value of forecasts. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:02","2018-01-19 22:57:02","","2967-2986","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Probabilistic forecasts; Risk assessment; streamflow; Risk analysis; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Floods; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; watershed; Economics; decision making; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; flood damage; Hydrological modeling; economic analysis; ensemble forecasting; Stream flow; Forecast reliability; Streamflow forecasting; Streamflow distribution; Deterministic forecasts; Economic assessments; Error statistics; Forecast uncertainty; Montmorency River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, developing a realistic representation of irrigation is critical to understanding land-atmosphere interactions in agricultural areas. Irrigation parameterizations are becoming more common in land surface models and are growing in sophistication, but there is difficulty in assessing the realism of these schemes, due to limited observations (e.g., soil moisture, evapotranspiration) and scant reporting of irrigation timing and quantity. This study uses the Noah land surface model run at high resolution within NASA's Land Information System to assess the physics of a sprinkler irrigation simulation scheme and model sensitivity to choice of irrigation intensity and greenness fraction datasets over a small, high-resolution domain in Nebraska. Differences between experiments are small at the interannual scale but become more apparent at seasonal and daily timescales. In addition, this study uses point and gridded soil moisture observations from fixed and roving cosmic-ray neutron probes and co-located human-practice data to evaluate the realism of irrigation amounts and soil moisture impacts simulated by the model. Results show that field-scale heterogeneity resulting from the individual actions of farmers is not captured by the model and the amount of irrigation applied by the model exceeds that applied at the two irrigated fields.

Overall, the results underscore the necessity of both high-quality meteorological forcing data and proper representation of irrigation for accurate simulation of water and energy states and fluxes over cropland. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:04","2018-01-19 22:57:04","","2953-2966","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Nebraska; United States; soil moisture; data set; land surface; irrigation; parameterization; Surface measurement; Agriculture; energy flux; Water and energy fluxes; assessment method; water flow; Irrigation; Soil moisture; Soils; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; Land surface modeling; boundary layer; Moisture; cosmic ray; Cosmology; Meteorological forcing; NASA; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Irrigation intensities; Land atmosphere interaction; Land information systems; Limited observations; neutron probe; Planetary boundary layers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It therefore offers too small a sample of extreme low-flow events to properly explore the long-term evolution of their characteristics and associated impacts. To overcome this limit, this work first presents a daily 140-year ensemble reconstructed streamflow dataset for a reference network of near-natural catchments in France. This dataset, called SCOPE Hydro (Spatially COherent Probabilistic Extended Hydrological dataset), is based on (1) a probabilistic precipitation, temperature, and reference evapotranspiration downscaling of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis over France, called SCOPE Climate, and (2) continuous hydrological modelling using SCOPE Climate as forcings over the whole period. This work then introduces tools for defining spatio-temporal extreme low-flow events. Extreme low-flow events are first locally defined through the sequent peak algorithm using a novel combination of a fixed threshold and a daily variable threshold. A dedicated spatial matching procedure is then established to identify spatio-temporal events across France. This procedure is furthermore adapted to the SCOPE Hydro 25-member ensemble to characterize in a probabilistic way unrecorded historical events at the national scale. Extreme low-flow events are described and compared in a spatially and temporally homogeneous way over 140 years on a large set of catchments. Results highlight well-known recent events like 1976 or 1989&ndash;1990, but also older and relatively forgotten ones like the 1878 and 1893 events. These results contribute to improving our knowledge of historical events and provide a selection of benchmark events for climate change adaptation purposes. Moreover, this study allows for further detailed analyses of the effect of climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on low-flow hydrology at the scale of France. © 2017 Author(s).

Similarities in 16 flow signatures and 35 catchment descriptors were explored for 35 215 catchments and 1366 river gauges across Europe. Correlation analyses and stepwise regressions were used to identify the best explanatory variables for each signature. Catchments were clustered and analyzed for similarities in flow signature values, physiography and the combination of the two. We found the following. (i) A 15 to 33 % (depending on the classification used) improvement in regression model skills when combined with catchment classification versus simply using all catchments at once. (ii) Twelve out of 16 flow signatures were mainly controlled by climatic characteristics, especially those related to average and high flows. For the baseflow index, geology was more important and topography was the main control for the flashiness of flow. For most of the flow signatures, the second most important descriptor is generally land cover (mean flow, high flows, runoff coefficient, ET, variability of reversals). (iii) Using a classification and regression tree (CART), we further show that Europe can be divided into 10 classes with both similar flow signatures and physiography. The most dominant separation found was between energy-limited and moisture-limited catchments. The CART analyses also separated different explanatory variables for the same class of catchments. For example, the damped peak response for one class was explained by the presence of large water bodies for some catchments, while large flatland areas explained it for other catchments in the same class. In conclusion, we find that this type of comparative hydrology is a helpful tool for understanding hydrological variability, but is constrained by unknown human impacts on the water cycle and by relatively crude explanatory variables. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:09","2018-01-19 22:57:09","","2863-2879","","6","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Correlation analysis; Europe; Regression analysis; Runoff; catchment; classification; correlation; gauge; hydrological cycle; regression analysis; data set; topography; hydrological change; spatial distribution; Catchments; Hydrology; Geomorphology; Classification (of information); flow modeling; Comparative hydrologies; Explanatory variables; Hydrological variability; Catchment classifications; Classification and regression tree; Runoff coefficients; Stepwise regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The models were all driven by the WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI) meteorological dataset, but used different datasets for non-meteorologic inputs and were run at various spatial and temporal resolutions, although all data were re-sampled to a common 0. 5° spatial and daily temporal resolution. For the evaluation, we used a broad range of performance metrics related to important aspects of the hydrograph. We found pronounced inter-model performance differences, underscoring the importance of hydrological model uncertainty in addition to climate input uncertainty, for example in studies assessing the hydrological impacts of climate change. The uncalibrated GHMs were found to perform, on average, better than the uncalibrated LSMs in snow-dominated regions, while the ensemble mean was found to perform only slightly worse than the best (calibrated) model. The inclusion of less-accurate models did not appreciably degrade the ensemble performance. Overall, we argue that more effort should be devoted on calibrating and regionalizing the parameters of macro-scale models. We further found that, despite adjustments using gauge observations, the WFDEI precipitation data still contain substantial biases that propagate into the simulated runoff. The early bias in the spring snowmelt peak exhibited by most models is probably primarily due to the widespread precipitation underestimation at high northern latitudes. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:12","2018-01-19 22:57:12","","2881-2903","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Performance metrics; Runoff; performance assessment; streamflow; data set; land surface; Hydrological models; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Spatial and temporal resolutions; snowmelt; Temporal resolution; Hydrological impacts; Land surface models; Ensemble performance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their ecological integrity as well as their vital ecosystem services for humankind depend on regular patterns of inundation and drying provided by natural flow regimes. However, river hydrology has been altered worldwide. Dams cause less variable flow regimes and water abstractions decrease the amount of flow so that ecologically important flood pulses are often reduced. Given growing population pressure and projected climate change, immediate action is required. However, the implementation of counteractive measures is often a complex task. This study develops a screening tool for assessing hydrological threats to riparian wetlands on global scales. The approach is exemplified on 93 Ramsar sites, many of which are located in transboundary basins. First, the WaterGAP3 hydrological modeling framework is used to quantitatively compare current and future modified flow regimes to reference flow conditions. In our simulations current water resource management seriously impairs riparian wetland inundation at 29 % of the analyzed sites. A further 8 % experience significantly reduced flood pulses. In the future, eastern Europe, western Asia, as well as central South America could be hotspots of further flow modifications due to climate change. Second, a qualitative analysis of the 93 sites determined potential impact on overbank flows resulting from planned or proposed dam construction projects. They take place in one-third of the upstream areas and are likely to impair especially wetlands located in South America, Asia, and the Balkan Peninsula. Third, based on the existing legal/institutional framework and water resource availability upstream, further qualitative analysis evaluated the capacity to preserve overbank flows given future streamflow changes due to dam construction and climate change. Results indicate hotspots of vulnerability exist, especially in northern Africa and the Persian Gulf. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:14","2018-01-19 22:57:14","","2799-2815","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Europe; Iran; Water management; Water resources; streamflow; climate change; water management; Ecology; hydrological modeling; Floods; water resource; Ecosystems; global perspective; hydrological change; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; riparian zone; ecosystem service; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Waterresource management; River pollution; dam construction; Wetlands; Indian Ocean; wetland; Resource availability; hydrological regime; South America; Ecological integrity; Arabian Sea; Balkans; Mazandaran; Natural flow regime; North Africa; overbank flow; Persian Gulf; Qualitative analysis; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Sakht Sar; Transboundary basins; West Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The statistical properties of rainfall fields often exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity due to variability in the involved physical processes and influence of orographic forcing. The traditional approach to simulate stochastic rainfall fields based on the Fourier filtering of white noise is only able to reproduce the global power spectrum and spatial autocorrelation of the precipitation fields. Conceptually similar to wavelet analysis, the SSFT is a simple and effective extension of the Fourier transform developed for space-frequency localisation, which allows for using windows to better capture the local statistical structure of rainfall. The SSFT is used to generate stochastic noise and precipitation fields that replicate the local spatial correlation structure, i.e. anisotropy and correlation range, of the observed radar rainfall fields. The potential of the stochastic generator is demonstrated using four precipitation cases observed by the fourth generation of Swiss weather radars that display significant non-stationarity due to the coexistence of stratiform and convective precipitation, differential rotation of the weather system and locally varying anisotropy. The generator is verified in its ability to reproduce both the global and the local Fourier power spectra of the precipitation field. The SSFT-based stochastic generator can be applied and extended to improve the probabilistic nowcasting of precipitation, design storm simulation, stochastic numerical weather prediction (NWP) downscaling, and also for other geophysical applications involving the simulation of complex non-stationary fields. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:17","2018-01-19 22:57:17","","2777-2797","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Numerical weather prediction; Rain; correlation; rainfall; radar; White noise; heterogeneity; Weather forecasting; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic systems; climate prediction; stochasticity; precipitation (climatology); ensemble forecasting; autocorrelation; Spatial autocorrelations; Traditional approaches; Meteorological radar; Radar; orographic effect; Statistical properties; Statistical structures; anisotropy; Anisotropy; Convective precipitation; Fourier transform; Fourier transforms; Geophysical applications; Power spectrum; Space-based radar; Spatial correlation structures; spectrum; Wavelet analysis; white noise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the very beginning, this research on brine migration aimed at involving expert and stakeholder knowledge and assessment in simulating the impacts of injecting CO2 into deep saline aquifers by means of a participatory modeling process. The involvement exercise made use of two approaches. First, guideline-based interviews were carried out, aiming at eliciting expert and stakeholder knowledge and assessments of geological structures and mechanisms affecting CO2-induced brine migration. Second, a stakeholder workshop including the World Café format yielded evaluations and judgments of the numerical modeling approach, scenario selection, and preliminary simulation results. The participatory modeling approach gained several results covering brine migration in general, the geological model sketch, scenario development, and the review of the preliminary simulation results. These results were included in revised versions of both the geological model and the numerical model, helping to improve the analysis of regional-scale brine migration along vertical pathways due to CO2 injection. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:19","2018-01-19 22:57:19","","2739-2750","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; optimization; Hydrogeology; aquifer; Aquifers; risk assessment; saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; numerical model; stakeholder; participatory approach; drinking water; Potable water; Participatory modeling; environmental fate; expert system; guideline; Carbon dioxide; Saline water; site selection; Geology; carbon dioxide; Numerical models; solute transport; brine; Deep saline aquifers; Geologic models; Geological modeling; Geological storage; Geological structures; Numerical modeling approach; Pressure management; regional pattern; Scenario development; Site selection; vertical movement; Water injection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we propose innovative data-driven diagnostic signatures for overcoming the prevailing status quo in catchment inter-comparison. More specifically, we present dimensionless double mass curves (dDMC) which allow inference of information on runoff generation and the water balance at the seasonal and annual timescales. By separating the vegetation and winter periods, dDMC furthermore provide information on the role of biotic and abiotic controls in seasonal runoff formation. A key aspect we address in this paper is the derivation of dimensionless expressions of fluxes which ensure the comparability of the signatures in space and time. We achieve this by using the limiting factors of a hydrological process as a scaling reference. We show that different references result in different diagnostics. As such we define two kinds of dDMC which allow us to derive seasonal runoff coefficients and to characterize dimensionless streamflow release as a function of the potential renewal rate of the soil storage. We expect these signatures for storage controlled seasonal runoff formation to remain invariant, as long as the ratios of release over supply and supply over storage capacity develop similarly in different catchments. We test the proposed methods by applying them to an operational data set comprising 22 catchments (12-166 km2) from different environments in southern Germany and hydrometeorological data from 4 hydrological years. The diagnostics are used to compare the sites and to reveal the dominant controls on runoff formation. The key findings are that dDMC are meaningful signatures for catchment runoff formation at the seasonal to annual scale and that the type of scaling strongly influences the diagnostic potential of the dDMC. Adding discrimination between growing season and winter period was of fundamental importance and easy to implement by means of a temperature-index model. More specifically, temperature aggregates explain over 70 % of the variability of the seasonal summer runoff coefficients. The results also show that the soil topographic index, i.e. the product of topographic gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity, is significantly correlated with winter runoff coefficients, whereas the topographic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity alone are not. We conclude that proxies for gradients and resistances should be interpreted as a pair. Lastly, the dDMC concept reveals memory effects between summer and winter runoff regimes that are not relevant in spring between the transition from winter to summer. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:22","2018-01-19 22:57:22","","2817-2841","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Runoff; catchment; streamflow; data set; topography; runoff; innovation; seasonal variation; data management; Catchments; Digital storage; Hydrological process; hydrometeorology; water budget; hydraulic conductivity; Temperature index models; abiotic factor; Statistical tests; Topographic gradients; biotic factor; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Hydrometeorological data; Diagnostic potential; dimensionless number; Hydrological functions; Runoff generation process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our study, we investigated the impact of reducing the scale mismatch between surface energy flux and soil moisture observations by replacing point-scale soil moisture data with observations derived from Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensors (CRNSs) made at larger spatial scales. Five soil and evapotranspiration parameters of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) were calibrated against point-scale and Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor soil moisture data separately. We calibrated the model for 12 sites in the USA representing a range of climatic, soil, and vegetation conditions. The improvement in latent heat flux estimation for the two calibration solutions was assessed by comparison to eddy-covariance flux data and to JULES simulations with default parameter values. Calibrations against the two soil moisture products alone did show an advantage for the cosmic-ray technique. However, further analyses of two-objective calibrations with soil moisture and latent heat flux showed no substantial differences between both calibration strategies. This was mainly caused by the limited effect of calibrating soil parameters on soil moisture dynamics and surface energy fluxes.

Thus, in a site-specific risk assessment, models for predicting the fate of the displaced brine are required. Practical simulation of brine displacement involves decisions regarding the complexity of the model. The choice of an appropriate level of model complexity depends on multiple criteria: the target variable of interest, the relevant physical processes, the computational demand, the availability of data, and the data uncertainty. In this study, we set up a regional-scale geological model for a realistic (but not real) onshore site in the North German Basin with characteristic geological features for that region. A major aim of this work is to identify the relevant parameters controlling saltwater intrusion in a complex structural setting and to test the applicability of different model simplifications. The model that is used to identify relevant parameters fully couples flow in shallow freshwater aquifers and deep saline aquifers. This model also includes variable-density transport of salt and realistically incorporates surface boundary conditions with groundwater recharge. The complexity of this model is then reduced in several steps, by neglecting physical processes (two-phase flow near the injection well, variable-density flow) and by simplifying the complex geometry of the geological model. The results indicate that the initial salt distribution prior to the injection of CO2 is one of the key parameters controlling shallow aquifer salinization. However, determining the initial salt distribution involves large uncertainties in the regional-scale hydrogeological parameterization and requires complex and computationally demanding models (regional-scale variable-density salt transport). In order to evaluate strategies for minimizing leakage into shallow aquifers, other target variables can be considered, such as the volumetric leakage rate into shallow aquifers or the pressure buildup in the injection horizon. Our results show that simplified models, which neglect variable-density salt transport, can reach an acceptable agreement with more complex models. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:27","2018-01-19 22:57:27","","2751-2775","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; groundwater; Hydrogeology; parameterization; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mercury (metal); risk assessment; saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; drinking water; Potable water; environmental fate; model test; Digital storage; boundary condition; Ground water recharge; recharge; Carbon dioxide; Saline water; Geology; carbon dioxide; solute transport; brine; Deep saline aquifers; Geologic models; Geological modeling; regional pattern; vertical movement; Water injection; Brines; Computational demands; Geological features; Injection (oil wells); leakage; Model simplification; North German Basin; salinization; Surface boundary conditions; Two phase flow; Variable-density flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the measurement of Ks is expensive, it is frequently derived from statistical pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Because it is usually more difficult to describe Ks than θ(h) from pedotransfer functions, Pollacco et al. (2013) developed a physical unimodal model to compute Ks solely from hydraulic parameters derived from the Kosugi θ(h). This unimodal Ks model, which is based on a unimodal Kosugi soil pore-size distribution, was developed by combining the approach of Hagen-Poiseuille with Darcy's law and by introducing three tortuosity parameters. We report here on (1) the suitability of the Pollacco unimodal Ks model to predict Ks for a range of New Zealand soils from the New Zealand soil database (S-map) and (2) further adaptations to this model to adapt it to dual-porosity structured soils by computing the soil water flux through a continuous function of an improved bimodal pore-size distribution. The improved bimodal Ks model was tested with a New Zealand data set derived from historical measurements of Ks and θ(h) for a range of soils derived from sandstone and siltstone. The Ks data were collected using a small core size of 10 cm diameter, causing large uncertainty in replicate measurements. Predictions of Ks were further improved by distinguishing topsoils from subsoil. Nevertheless, as expected, stratifying the data with soil texture only slightly improved the predictions of the physical Ks models because the Ks model is based on pore-size distribution and the calibrated parameters were obtained within the physically feasible range. The improvements made to the unimodal Ks model by using the new bimodal Ks model are modest when compared to the unimodal model, which is explained by the poor accuracy of measured total porosity. Nevertheless, the new bimodal model provides an acceptable fit to the observed data. The study highlights the importance of improving Ks measurements with larger cores. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:30","2018-01-19 22:57:30","","2725-2737","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","soil moisture; New Zealand; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Soil hydraulic properties; Soil moisture; Soils; Flow of fluids; topsoil; hydraulic conductivity; Pore size; pore space; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; water retention; Darcy law; soil texture; Bimodal pore size distribution; Historical measurements; pedotransfer function; Pedotransfer functions; Porosity; Replicate measurements; sandstone; saturation; siltstone; size distribution; Size distribution; Soil moisture retentions; soil water potential; subsoil; tortuosity; Water retention curve","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional univariate statistical analysis cannot give accurate information regarding the multivariate nature of these events. We develop a conceptual model, implemented via pair-copula constructions, which allows for the quantification of the risk associated with compound events in present-day and future climate, as well as the uncertainty estimates around such risk. The model includes predictors, which could represent for instance meteorological processes that provide insight into both the involved physical mechanisms and the temporal variability of compound events. Moreover, this model enables multivariate statistical downscaling of compound events. Downscaling is required to extend the compound events' risk assessment to the past or future climate, where climate models either do not simulate realistic values of the local variables driving the events or do not simulate them at all. Based on the developed model, we study compound floods, i.e. joint storm surge and high river runoff, in Ravenna (Italy). To explicitly quantify the risk, we define the impact of compound floods as a function of sea and river levels. We use meteorological predictors to extend the analysis to the past, and get a more robust risk analysis. We quantify the uncertainties of the risk analysis, observing that they are very large due to the shortness of the available data, though this may also be the case in other studies where they have not been estimated. Ignoring the dependence between sea and river levels would result in an underestimation of risk; in particular, the expected return period of the highest compound flood observed increases from about 20 to 32 years when switching from the dependent to the independent case. ©Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:32","2018-01-19 22:57:32","","2701-2723","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Risk assessment; downscaling; climate modeling; Risk analysis; Statistical downscaling; Statistical methods; Uncertainty analysis; Risk perception; Rivers; Floods; Climate models; risk assessment; runoff; conceptual framework; uncertainty analysis; extreme event; Multivariant analysis; temporal variation; future prospect; flood; Conceptual model; return period; Temporal variability; Uncertainty estimates; Developed model; Emilia-Romagna; multivariate analysis; Multivariate extremes; Physical mechanism; Ravenna [Emilia-Romagna]; Statistical modelling; storm surge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ross method is an example of this type of scheme, and we show that it is equivalent to the Newton-Raphson method with a time-adaptive algorithm. Both algorithms are coupled to different time-stepping strategies: the standard heuristic approach based on the number of iterations and two strategies based on the time truncation error or on the change in water saturation.

The algorithm takes advantage of observations from multiple sensors in optical, short-infrared, and microwave bands, thereby allowing for detection and mapping of the sub-pixel fraction of inundated areas under almost all-sky conditions. The method relies on a nearest-neighbor search and a modern sparsity-promoting inversion method that make use of an a priori dataset in the form of two joint dictionaries. These dictionaries contain almost overlapping observations by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager and Sounder (SSMIS) on board the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F17 satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua and Terra satellites. Evaluation of the retrieval algorithm over the Mekong Delta shows that it is capable of capturing to a good degree the inundation diurnal variability due to localized convective precipitation. At longer timescales, the results demonstrate consistency with the ground-based water level observations, denoting that the method is properly capturing inundation seasonal patterns in response to regional monsoonal rain. The calculated Euclidean distance, rank-correlation, and also copula quantile analysis demonstrate a good agreement between the outputs of the algorithm and the observed water levels at monthly and daily timescales. The current inundation products are at a resolution of 12.5 km and taken twice per day, but a higher resolution (order of 5 km and every 3 h) can be achieved using the same algorithm with the dictionary populated by the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) products. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:37","2018-01-19 22:57:37","","2685-2700","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; algorithm; data set; Floods; Flood control; Satellites; Mapping; sensor; Precipitation (meteorology); Water levels; Spatial and temporal resolutions; diurnal variation; imaging method; timescale; MODIS; Nearest neighbor search; Radiometers; Image reconstruction; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite imagery; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Flood inundation mappings; Convective precipitation; Aqua (satellite); Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Global precipitation missions; Image retrieval; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; pixel; Retrieval algorithms; Special sensor microwave imagers; SSM-I; Terra (satellite)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ensemble land data assimilation methods rely on stochastic perturbations of input forcing and model prognostic fields for developing representations of input model error covariances. This article examines the limitations of using a single forcing dataset for specifying forcing uncertainty inputs for assimilating snow depth retrievals. Using an idealized data assimilation experiment, the article demonstrates that the use of hybrid forcing input strategies (either through the use of an ensemble of forcing products or through the added use of the forcing climatology) provide a better characterization of the background model error, which leads to improved data assimilation results, especially during the snow accumulation and melt-time periods. The use of hybrid forcing ensembles is then employed for assimilating snow depth retrievals from the AMSR2 instrument over two domains in the continental USA with different snow evolution characteristics. Over a region near the Great Lakes, where the snow evolution tends to be ephemeral, the use of hybrid forcing ensembles provides significant improvements relative to the use of a single forcing dataset. Over the Colorado headwaters characterized by large snow accumulation, the impact of using the forcing ensemble is less prominent and is largely limited to the snow transition time periods. The results of the article demonstrate that improving the background model error through the use of a forcing ensemble enables the assimilation system to better incorporate the observational information.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:43","2018-01-19 22:57:43","","2637-2647","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; data set; data assimilation; Data assimilation; uncertainty analysis; model validation; accuracy assessment; model test; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Great Lakes [North America]; error analysis; Errors; Data assimilation systems; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; snow accumulation; Snow accumulation; snow; headwater; Assimilation system; Colorado Basin [North America]; depth; Evolution characteristics; Land data assimilation; Stochastic perturbations; Uncertainty inputs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In practise, models based on physics are applied alongside those utilizing only statistical analysis. The former require enormous computational power, while the latter are mostly limited in accuracy and spatial coverage. In this paper we introduce an alternate, statistical approach based on Bayesian networks (BNs), a graphical model for dependent random variables. We use a non-parametric BN to describe the joint distribution of extreme discharges in European rivers and variables representing the geographical characteristics of their catchments. Annual maxima of daily discharges from more than 1800 river gauges (stations with catchment areas ranging from 1.4 to 807ĝ€000ĝ€km2) were collected, together with information on terrain, land use and local climate. The (conditional) correlations between the variables are modelled through copulas, with the dependency structure defined in the network. The results show that using this method, mean annual maxima and return periods of discharges could be estimated with an accuracy similar to existing studies using physical models for Europe and better than a comparable global statistical model. Performance of the model varies slightly between regions of Europe, but is consistent between different time periods, and remains the same in a split-sample validation. Though discharge prediction under climate change is not the main scope of this paper, the BN was applied to a large domain covering all sizes of rivers in the continent both for present and future climate, as an example. Results show substantial variation in the influence of climate change on river discharges. The model can be used to provide quick estimates of extreme discharges at any location for the purpose of obtaining input information for hydraulic modelling.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:45","2018-01-19 22:57:45","","2615-2636","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Europe; Runoff; river discharge; Statistical modeling; climate change; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Land use; network analysis; Catchments; river basin; Hydrological modelling; estimation method; flood; Bayesian Networks (bns); land use; Statistical approach; Computational power; Dependency structures; Discharge predictions; Substantial variations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data availability in high-latitude regions, however, proves to be a major challenge associated with this type of application (Tetzlaff et al., 2015). Models require a time series of isotopes in precipitation (δ18Oppt)) to drive simulations, and throughout much of the world - particularly in sparsely populated high-latitude regions - these data are not widely available. Here we investigate the impact that choice of precipitation isotope product (δ18Oppt)) has on simulations of streamflow, δ18O in streamflow (δ18OSF)), resulting hydrograph separations, and model parameters. In a high-latitude, datasparse, seasonal basin (Fort Simpson, NWT, Canada), we assess three precipitation isotope products of different spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e. semi-annual static, seasonal KPN43, and daily bias-corrected REMOiso), and apply them to force the isoWATFLOOD tracer-aided hydrologic model. Total simulated streamflow is not significantly impacted by choice of δ18Oppt) product; however, simulated isotopes in streamflow (δ18OSF)) and the internal apportionment of water (driven by model parameterization) are impacted. The highest-resolution product (REMOiso) was distinct from the two lower-resolution products (KPN43 and static), but could not be verified as correct due to a lack of daily δ18Oppt) observations. The resolution of δ18Oppt) impacts model parameterization and seasonal hydrograph separations, producing notable differences among simulations following large snowmelt and rainfall events when event compositions differ significantly from δ18OSF). Capturing and preserving the spatial variability in δ18Oppt) using distributed tracer-aided models is important because this variability impacts model parameterization. We achieve an understanding of tracer-aided modelling and its application in high-latitude regions with limited δ18Oppt) observations, and the value such models have in defining modelling uncertainty. In this study, application of a tracer-aided model is able to identify simulations with improved internal process representation, reinforcing the fact that tracer-aided modelling approaches assist with resolving hydrograph component contributions and work towards diagnosing equifinality. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:48","2018-01-19 22:57:48","","2595-2614","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","rainfall; streamflow; Hydrological models; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Canada; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; chemical composition; Hydrology; river basin; spatial variation; Digital storage; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Hydrological modelling; Parameterization; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); Stream flow; Isotopes; tracer; snowmelt; Hydrograph separation; oxygen isotope; Model parameterization; Process understanding; Fort Simpson; High-latitude regions; Northwest Territories; Process representation; Separation; Source separation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are typical landscapes of lowland regions that have high potential for water retention. However, the hydrology of these wetlands in tropical regions is often studied in isolation from the processes taking place at the catchment scale. Our main objective is to study the hydrological dynamics of one of the largest tropical rainforest regions on an island using a combination of satellite remote sensing and novel observations from dedicated field campaigns. This contribution offers a comprehensive analysis of the hydrological dynamics of two neighbouring poorly gauged tropical basins; the Kapuas basin (98g700gkm2) in West Kalimantan and the Mahakam basin (77g100gkm2) in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Both basins are characterised by vast areas of inland lowlands. Hereby, we put specific emphasis on key hydrological variables and indicators such as discharge and flood extent. The hydroclimatological data described herein were obtained during fieldwork campaigns carried out in the Kapuas over the period 2013-2015 and in the Mahakam over the period 2008-2010. Additionally, we used the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall estimates over the period 1998-2015 to analyse the distribution of rainfall and the influence of El-Niño - Southern Oscillation. Flood occurrence maps were obtained from the analysis of the Phase Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images from 2007 to 2010. Drought events were derived from time series of simulated groundwater recharge using time series of TRMM rainfall estimates, potential evapotranspiration estimates and the threshold level approach. The Kapuas and the Mahakam lake regions are vast reservoirs of water of about 1000 and 1500gkm2 that can store as much as 3 and 6.5 billiongm3 of water, respectively. These storage capacity values can be doubled considering the area of flooding under vegetation cover. Discharge time series show that backwater effects are highly influential in the wetland regions, which can be partly explained by inundation dynamics shown by flood occurrence maps obtained from PALSAR images. In contrast to their nature as wetlands, both lowland areas have frequent periods with low soil moisture conditions and low groundwater recharge. The Mahakam wetland area regularly exhibits low groundwater recharge, which may lead to prolonged drought events that can last up to 13 months. It appears that the Mahakam lowland is more vulnerable to hydrological drought, leading to more frequent fire occurrences than in the Kapuas basin. © Author(s) 2017.

This paper examines the potential for subsurface storage (SSS) in the Ganges basin to mitigate floods in the downstream areas and increase the availability of water during drier months. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to estimate ""sub-basin"" water availability. The water availability estimated is then compared with the sub-basinwise unmet water demand for agriculture. Hydrological analysis reveals that some of the unmet water demand in the subbasin can be met provided it is possible to capture the runoff in sub-surface storage during the monsoon season (June to September). Some of the groundwater recharge is returned to the stream as baseflow and has the potential to increase dry season river flows. To examine the impacts of groundwater recharge on flood inundation and flows in the dry season (October to May), two groundwater recharge scenarios are tested in the Ramganga sub-basin. Increasing groundwater recharge by 35 and 65% of the current level would increase the baseflow during the dry season by 1.46 billion m3 (34.5% of the baseline) and 3.01 billion m3 (71.3% of the baseline), respectively. Analysis of pumping scenarios indicates that 80 000 to 112 000 ha of additional wheat area can be irrigated in the Ramganga sub-basin by additional SSS without reducing the current baseflow volumes. Augmenting SSS reduces the peak flow and flood inundated areas in Ramganga (by up to 13.0%for the 65%scenario compared to the baseline), indicating the effectiveness of SSS in reducing areas inundated under floods in the sub-basin. However, this may not be sufficient to effectively control the flood in the downstream areas of the GRB, such as in the state of Bihar (prone to floods), which receives a total flow of 277 billion m3 from upstream sub-basins. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:57:53","2018-01-19 22:57:53","","2545-2557","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; dry season; groundwater; river flow; water availability; Drought; Rivers; Floods; Flood control; Groundwater; Agriculture; runoff; Soil and water assessment tool; groundwater flow; agricultural production; water demand; flood; Ground water recharge; recharge; Triticum aestivum; India; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Ganges River; Recharging (underground waters); Hydrological analysis; baseflow; peak flow; Agricultural machinery; Water availability; Downstream areas; Agricultural runoff; Agricultural productions; Bihar; Monsoon season; Ramganga River; Water shortages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This generates major challenges for economic activity in the region. Among other issues is the long-term planning and development of socio-economic infrastructure (dams, bridges, roads, etc.), which require climate-based forecasts of the frequency and magnitude of detrimental flood events. To estimate the cost of the infrastructure and operational risk, a probabilistic form of long-term forecasting is preferable. In this study, a probabilistic model to simulate the parameters of the probability density function (PDF) for multi-year runoff based on a projected climatology is applied to evaluate changes in extreme floods for the territory of the Russian Arctic. The model is validated by cross-comparison of the modelled and empirical PDFs using observations from 23 sites located in northern Russia. The mean values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of the spring flood depth of runoff are evaluated under four climate scenarios, using simulations of six climate models for the period 2010-2039. Regions with substantial expected changes in the means and CVs of spring flood depth of runoff are outlined.

Flow forecasts, generated by coupling rainfall predictions with a hydrologic runoff model, can potentially be used to optimize the operation of integrated urban drainage-wastewater systems (IUDWSs) during both wet and dry weather periods. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have significantly improved in recent years, having increased their spatial and temporal resolution. Finer resolution NWP are suitable for urban-catchment-scale applications, providing longer lead time than radar extrapolation. However, forecasts are inevitably uncertain, and fine resolution is especially challenging for NWP. This uncertainty is commonly addressed in meteorology with ensemble prediction systems (EPSs). Handling uncertainty is challenging for decision makers and hence tools are necessary to provide insight on ensemble forecast usage and to support the rationality of decisions (i.e. forecasts are uncertain and therefore errors will be made; decision makers need tools to justify their choices, demonstrating that these choices are beneficial in the long run). <br><br> This study presents an economic framework to support the decision-making process by providing information on when acting on the forecast is beneficial and how to handle the EPS. The relative economic value (REV) approach associates economic values with the potential outcomes and determines the preferential use of the EPS forecast. The envelope curve of the REV diagram combines the results from each probability forecast to provide the highest relative economic value for a given gain-loss ratio. This approach is traditionally used at larger scales to assess mitigation measures for adverse events (i.e. the actions are taken when events are forecast). The specificity of this study is to optimize the energy consumption in IUDWS during low-flow periods by exploiting the electrical smart grid market (i.e. the actions are taken when no events are forecast). Furthermore, the results demonstrate the benefit of NWP neighbourhood post-processing methods to enhance the forecast skill and increase the range of beneficial uses. © Author(s) 2017.

In contrast, cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) allow highly accurate soil moisture estimation on the field scale which could be valuable to improve land surface model predictions. In this study, the potential of a network of CRNSs installed in the 2354g km2 Rur catchment (Germany) for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and improving soil moisture states was tested. Data measured by the CRNSs were assimilated with the local ensemble transform Kalman filter in the Community Land Model version 4.5. Data of four, eight and nine CRNSs were assimilated for the years 2011 and 2012 (with and without soil hydraulic parameter estimation), followed by a verification year 2013 without data assimilation. This was done using (i) a regional high-resolution soil map, (ii) the FAO soil map and (iii) an erroneous, biased soil map as input information for the simulations. For the regional soil map, soil moisture characterization was only improved in the assimilation period but not in the verification period. For the FAO soil map and the biased soil map, soil moisture predictions improved strongly to a root mean square error of 0.03g cm3g cmg-3 for the assimilation period and 0.05g cm3g cmg-3 for the evaluation period. Improvements were limited by the measurement error of CRNSs (0.03g cm3g cmg-3). The positive results obtained with data assimilation of nine CRNSs were confirmed by the jackknife experiments with four and eight CRNSs used for assimilation. The results demonstrate that assimilated data of a CRNS network can improve the characterization of soil moisture content on the catchment scale by updating spatially distributed soil hydraulic parameters of a land surface model. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:01","2018-01-19 22:58:01","","2509-2530","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Runoff; Vegetation; catchment; prediction; soil moisture; land surface; remote sensing; data assimilation; Parameter estimation; Surface measurement; Forecasting; Community land models; sensor; Catchments; experimental study; Soil moisture; Soils; Kalman filter; Land surface modeling; estimation method; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; Soil surveys; hydraulic conductivity; Moisture; Moisture determination; cosmic ray; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Moisture control; Soil moisture measurement; Neutrons; Sensor networks; Moisture meters; Surface roughness; Remotely sensed soil moisture; Soil hydraulic parameters; Soil moisture estimation; Soil moisture predictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in most of the cases, the sampling uncertainty, from which small-sized samples suffer, is neglected. In this paper, considering a real reservoir controlled by a dam as a case study, we apply a structure-based approach to estimate the probability of reaching specific reservoir levels, taking into account the key components of an event (flood peak, volume, hydrograph shape) and of the reservoir (rating curve, volume&ndash;water depth relation). Additionally, we improve information about the peaks from historical data and reports through a Bayesian framework, allowing the incorporation of supplementary knowledge from different sources and its associated error. As it is seen here, the extra information can result in a very different inferred parameter set and consequently this is reflected as a strong variability of the reservoir level, associated with a given return period. Most importantly, the sampling uncertainty is accounted for in both cases (single-site and multi-site with historical information scenarios), and Monte Carlo confidence intervals for the maximum water level are calculated. It is shown that water levels of specific return periods in a lot of cases overlap, thus making risk assessment, without providing confidence intervals, deceiving. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:04","2018-01-19 22:58:04","","2497-2507","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Bayesian analysis; probability; Monte Carlo analysis; Floods; flooding; Flood control; uncertainty analysis; Water levels; knowledge; water level; Reservoirs (water); Confidence interval; Flood mitigation; Bayesian frameworks; Historical data; Historical information; hydrography; Multivariate function; overtopping; Sampling uncertainties; Structure-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It interacts with the atmosphere through the exchange of water and energy and hence influences weather and climate, as well as their predictability. Correspondingly, the land surface model (LSM) is an essential part of any weather forecasting system. LSMs rely on partly poorly constrained parameters, due to sparse land surface observations. With the use of newly available land surface temperature observations, we show in this study that novel satellite-derived datasets help improve LSM configuration, and hence can contribute to improved weather predictability. We use the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme of Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) and validate it comprehensively against an array of Earth observation reference datasets, including the new land surface temperature product. This reveals satisfactory model performance in terms of hydrology but poor performance in terms of land surface temperature. This is due to inconsistencies of process representations in the model as identified from an analysis of perturbed parameter simulations. We show that HTESSEL can be more robustly calibrated with multiple instead of single reference datasets as this mitigates the impact of the structural inconsistencies. Finally, performing coupled global weather forecasts, we find that a more robust calibration of HTESSEL also contributes to improved weather forecast skills. In summary, new satellite-based Earth observations are shown to enhance the multi-dataset calibration of LSMs, thereby improving the representation of insufficiently captured processes, advancing weather predictability, and understanding of climate system feedbacks. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:06","2018-01-19 22:58:06","","2483-2495","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; hydrology; data set; land surface; parameterization; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Satellites; weather forecasting; calibration; model test; Hydrology; Land surface modeling; boundary layer; array; satellite imagery; Land surface temperature; Atmospheric temperature; climate conditions; surface temperature; Observatories; Satellite based Earth observation; Process representation; climate feedback; Constrained parameters; Earth (planet); Parameter simulations; Satisfactory modeling; weather; Weather predictability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The precipitation amounts themselves are crucial for stochastic rainfall generators and weather generators. Nonparametric kernel density estimates (KDEs) offer a more flexible way to model precipitation amounts. As already stated in their name, these models do not exhibit parameters that can be easily regionalized to run rainfall generators at ungauged locations as well as at gauged locations. To overcome this deficiency, we present a new interpolation scheme for nonparametric models and evaluate it for different temporal resolutions ranging from hourly to monthly. During the evaluation, the nonparametric methods are compared to commonly used parametric models like the two-parameter gamma and the mixed-exponential distribution. As water volume is considered to be an essential parameter for applications like flood modeling, a Lorenz-curve-based criterion is also introduced. To add value to the estimation of data at sub-daily resolutions, we incorporated the plentiful daily measurements in the interpolation scheme, and this idea was evaluated. The study region is the federal state of Baden-WÃ1/4rttemberg in the southwest of Germany with more than 500Â rain gauges.

It is remarkable to understand vegetation distribution and dynamics under climate change in this transect. We take canopy cover (M), derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as an index to describe the properties of vegetation distribution and dynamics in the NECT. In Eagleson's ecohydrological optimality theory, the optimal canopy cover (M∗) is determined by the trade-off between water supply depending on water balance and water demand depending on canopy transpiration. We apply Eagleson's ecohydrological optimality method in the NECT based on data from 2000 to 2013 to get M∗, which is compared with M from NDVI to further discuss the sensitivity of M∗ to vegetation properties and climate factors. The result indicates that the average M∗ fits the actual M well (for forest, M∗ Combining double low line 0.822 while M Combining double low line 0.826; for grassland, M∗ Combining double low line 0.353 while M Combining double low line 0.352; the correlation coefficient between M and M∗ is 0.81). Results of water balance also match the field-measured data in the references. The sensitivity analyses show that M∗ decreases with the increase of leaf area index (LAI), stem fraction and temperature, while it increases with the increase of leaf angle and precipitation amount.

Nowadays, after decades of functioning hydrological automatic networks, there is an abundance of high-resolution rainfall data with a reasonable statistic representation, which enable the direct research of temporal patterns and inner structures of rainfall events at a given geographic location, with the aim of establishing a statistical synthesis directly based on those observed patterns. The authors propose a temporal design storm defined in analytical terms, through a two-parameter gamma-type function. The two parameters are directly estimated from 73 independent storms identified from rainfall records of high temporal resolution in Valencia (Spain). All the relevant analytical properties derived from that function are developed in order to use this storm in real applications. In particular, in order to assign a probability to the design storm (return period), an auxiliary variable combining maximum intensity and total cumulated rainfall is introduced. As a result, for a given return period, a set of three storms with different duration, depth and peak intensity are defined. The consistency of the results is verified by means of comparison with the classic method of alternating blocks based on an IDF curve, for the above mentioned study case. © Author(s) 2017.

The usual rain gauge-based approach provides accurate curves for a specific location, but uncertainties arise when ungauged regions are examined or catchment-scale information is required. Remote sensing rainfall records, e.g. from weather radars and satellites, are recently becoming available, providing high-resolution estimates at regional or even global scales; their uncertainty and implications on water resources applications urge to be investigated. This study compares IDF curves from radar and satellite (CMORPH) estimates over the eastern Mediterranean (covering Mediterranean, semiarid, and arid climates) and quantifies the uncertainty related to their limited record on varying climates. We show that radar identifies thicker-tailed distributions than satellite, in particular for short durations, and that the tail of the distributions depends on the spatial and temporal aggregation scales. The spatial correlation between radar IDF and satellite IDF is as high as 0.7 for 2-5-year return period and decreases with longer return periods, especially for short durations. The uncertainty related to the use of short records is important when the record length is comparable to the return period (∼50, ∼100, and ∼150% for Mediterranean, semiarid, and arid climates, respectively). The agreement between IDF curves derived from different sensors on Mediterranean and, to a good extent, semiarid climates, demonstrates the potential of remote sensing datasets and instils confidence on their quantitative use for ungauged areas of the Earth. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:16","2018-01-19 22:58:16","","2389-2404","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Water resources; rainfall; satellite data; remote sensing; radar; Uncertainty analysis; water resource; Satellites; Remote sensing; Catchments; Rainfall extremes; Spatial correlations; Intensity-duration-frequency curves; semiarid region; return period; Gages; raingauge; Mediterranean Region; Rain gages; Rainfall estimates; Meteorological radar; Radar; Eastern Mediterranean; satellite sensor; Space-based radar; Probability of occurrence; Semi-arid climate; Temporal aggregation; Weather satellites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They provide critical habitats and a variety of ecosystem services in this arid environment. Since desert riparian forests are also sensitive to disturbance, examining the spatial distribution and temporal variation of these forests and their influencing factors is important to determine the limiting factors of vegetation recovery after long-term restoration. In this study, field experiment and remote sensing data were used to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of desert riparian forests and their relationship with the environmental factors. We classified five types of vegetation communities at different distances from the river channel. Community coverage and diversity formed a bimodal pattern, peaking at the distances of 1000 and 3000m from the river channel. In general, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trend from 2000 to 2014 was positive at different distances from the river channel, except for the region closest to the river bank (i.e. within 500m from the river channel), which had been undergoing degradation since 2011. The spatial distribution of desert riparian forests was mainly influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture, bulk density and soil particle composition). Meanwhile, while the temporal variation of vegetation was affected by both the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture and soil particle composition) and to a lesser extent, the temporal variation of water availability (e.g. annual average and variability of groundwater, soil moisture and runoff). Since surface (0-30cm) and deep (100-200cm) soil moisture, bulk density and the annual average of soil moisture at 100cm obtained from the remote sensing data were regarded as major determining factors of community distribution and temporal variation, conservation measures that protect the soil structure and prevent soil moisture depletion (e.g. artificial soil cover and water conveyance channels) were suggested to better protect desert riparian forests under climate change and intensive human disturbance. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:19","2018-01-19 22:58:19","","2405-2419","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; NDVI; Vegetation; remote sensing; climate change; environmental factor; Rivers; Groundwater; Ecosystems; Watersheds; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; Remote sensing; Forestry; Soil moisture; Soils; Landforms; environmental disturbance; human activity; ecosystem service; temporal variation; regeneration; Spatial heterogeneity; Soil surveys; Remote sensing data; Soil conservation; Conservation; Moisture; vegetation dynamics; Gansu; soil property; riparian forest; Normalized difference vegetation index; Water availability; Heihe Basin; Restoration; community dynamics; Conservation measures; desert; environmental degradation; Environmental factors; plant community; Vegetation community; Vegetation recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim was to characterize urban catchment properties accounting for the complexity and inhomogeneity typical of urban water systems. Sewer system density and imperviousness (roads or buildings), represented in rasterized maps of 2m × 2m pixels, were analysed to quantify their fractal dimension, characteristic of scaling invariance. The results showed that both sewer density and imperviousness exhibit scale-invariant features and can be characterized with the help of fractal dimensions ranging from 1.6 to 2, depending on the catchment. In a given area consistent results were found for the two geometrical features, yielding a robust and innovative way of quantifying the level of urbanization. The representation of imperviousness in operational semi-distributed hydrological models for these catchments was also investigated by computing fractal dimensions of the geometrical sets made up of the sub-catchments with coefficients of imperviousness greater than a range of thresholds.

Flood risk increases when landscapes degrade, counteracted or aggravated by engineering solutions. Efforts to maintain and restore buffering as an ecosystem function may help adaptation to climate change, but this require quantification of effectiveness in their specific social-ecological context. However, the specific role of forests, trees, soil and drainage pathways in flow buffering, given geology, land form and climate, remains controversial. When complementing the scarce heavily instrumented catchments with reliable long-term data, especially in the tropics, there is a need for metrics for data-sparse conditions. We present and discuss a flow persistence metric that relates transmission to river flow of peak rainfall events to the base-flow component of the water balance. The dimensionless flow persistence parameter Fp is defined in a recursive flow model and can be estimated from limited time series of observed daily flow, without requiring knowledge of spatially distributed rainfall upstream. The Fp metric (or its change over time from what appears to be the local norm) matches local knowledge concepts. Inter-annual variation in the Fp metric in sample watersheds correlates with variation in the ""flashiness index"" used in existing watershed health monitoring programmes, but the relationship between these metrics varies with context. Inter-annual variation in Fp also correlates with common base-flow indicators, but again in a way that varies between watersheds. Further exploration of the responsiveness of Fp in watersheds with different characteristics to the interaction of land cover and the specific realisation of space-time patterns of rainfall in a limited observation period is needed to evaluate interpretation of Fp as an indicator of anthropogenic changes in watershed conditions. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:24","2018-01-19 22:58:24","","2321-2340","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; catchment; river flow; time series analysis; data assimilation; Ecology; Floods; flooding; risk assessment; Ecosystems; Watersheds; ecosystem function; Flow of water; ecosystem service; traditional knowledge; water budget; Stream flow; Aerodynamics; precipitation intensity; baseflow; persistence; Interannual variation; Flood risk reduction; Limited observations; Adaptation to climate changes; Anthropogenic changes; Base flow components; Buffer amplifiers; Ecosystem functions; Engineering solutions; health monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ""ecosystem service"" is inherent to geology and climate, but buffering also responds to human use and misuse of the landscape. Buffering can be part of management feedback loops if salient, credible and legitimate indicators are used. The flow persistence parameter Fp in a parsimonious recursive model of river flow (Part 1, van Noordwijk et al., 2017) couples the transmission of extreme rainfall events (1-Fp), to the annual base-flow fraction of a watershed (Fp). Here we compare Fp estimates from four meso-scale watersheds in Indonesia (Cidanau, Way Besai and Bialo) and Thailand (Mae Chaem), with varying climate, geology and land cover history, at a decadal timescale. The likely response in each of these four to variation in rainfall properties (including the maximum hourly rainfall intensity) and land cover (comparing scenarios with either more or less forest and tree cover than the current situation) was explored through a basic daily water-balance model, GenRiver. This model was calibrated for each site on existing data, before being used for alternative land cover and rainfall parameter settings. In both data and model runs, the wet-season (3-monthly) Fp values were consistently lower than dry-season values for all four sites. Across the four catchments Fp values decreased with increasing annual rainfall, but specific aspects of watersheds, such as the riparian swamp (peat soils) in Cidanau reduced effects of land use change in the upper watershed. Increasing the mean rainfall intensity (at constant monthly totals for rainfall) around the values considered typical for each landscape was predicted to cause a decrease in Fp values by between 0.047 (Bialo) and 0.261 (Mae Chaem). Sensitivity of Fp to changes in land use change plus changes in rainfall intensity depends on other characteristics of the watersheds, and generalisations made on the basis of one or two case studies may not hold, even within the same climatic zone. A wet-season Fp value above 0.7 was achievable in forest-agroforestry mosaic case studies. Inter-annual variability in Fp is large relative to effects of land cover change. Multiple (5-10) years of paired-plot data would generally be needed to reject nochange null hypotheses on the effects of land use change (degradation and restoration). Fp trends over time serve as a holistic scale-dependent performance indicator of degrading/ recovering watershed health and can be tested for acceptability and acceptance in a wider social-ecological context. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:27","2018-01-19 22:58:27","","2341-2360","","5","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large number of rainfall-runoff events from three catchments of Tar River basin in North Carolina are used to illustrate the analytical framework. Specifically, the framework is used to estimate three flood event characteristics (cumulative runoff volume, centroid, and ""spreadness"" of hydrograph) through three corresponding framework parameters: the rainfall excess and the mean and variance of catchment response time. Results show that, under the smooth topographic setups of the study area, the spatial and/or temporal correlation between rainfall and runoff generation are insignificant to flood response; delay in flood response due to runoff generation and routing are of equal importance; the shape of the flood is mainly controlled by the variability in runoff generation stage but with non-negligible contribution from the runoff routing stage. Sensitivity tests show that the framework's main error source is the systematic underestimation of the flood event's centroid and spreadness, while the random error is relatively low. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:28","2018-01-19 22:58:28","","2277-2299","","5","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; United States; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; Floods; spatiotemporal analysis; Network function virtualization; Catchments; hydrological response; flood; Distributed hydrologic model; Space-time variability; North Carolina; flood routing; Runoff generation process; analytical framework; Catchment response time; Multiple components; Rainfall and runoffs; Rainfall-runoff events; Tar Basin; Temporal correlations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpine swamp meadow, a unique grassland type in the eastern Tibetan Plateau that provides important ecosystem services to the upstream and downstream regions of international rivers of Asia and other parts of the world, is undergoing severe degradation, which can dramatically alter soil hydraulic properties and water cycling processes. However, the effects of alpine swamp meadow degradation on soil hydraulic properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, soil moisture content (SMC), field capacity (FC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (<i>K</i>s) together with several basic soil properties under lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD) and severely degraded (SD) alpine swamp meadow were investigated; the variations in SMC, FC and <i>K</i>s with alpine swamp meadow degradation and their dominant influencing factors were analysed. The results showed that SMC and FC decreased consistently from LD to SD, while <i>K</i>s decreased from LD to MD and then increased from MD to SD, following the order of LDĝ€ &gt; ĝ€SDĝ€ &gt; ĝ€MD. Significant differences in soil hydraulic properties between degradation degrees were found in the upper soil layers (0&ndash;20ĝ€cm), indicating that the influences of degradation were most pronounced in the topsoils. FC was positively correlated with capillary porosity, water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon, and silt and clay content; <i>K</i>s was positively correlated with non-capillary porosity (NCP). Relative to other soil properties, soil porosity is the dominant factor influencing FC and <i>K</i>s. Capillary porosity explained 91.1ĝ€% of total variance in FC, and NCP explained 97.3ĝ€% of total variance in <i>K</i>s. The combined effect of disappearing root activities and increasing sand content was responsible for the inconsistent patterns of NCP and <i>K</i>s. Our findings suggest that alpine swamp meadow degradation would inevitably lead to reduced water holding capacity and rainfall infiltration. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effects of vegetation degradation. Further hydrological modelling studies in the Tibetan Plateau and similar regions are recommended to understand the effects of degraded alpine swamp meadows on soil hydraulic properties. © Author(s) 2017.

In this study, a national-scale flood risk assessment approach is proposed and developed. The study focuses on using global and national datasets available with various resolutions to create flood risk maps. First, a flood hazard map of Canada is developed using topography-based parameters derived from digital elevation models, namely, elevation above nearest drainage (EAND) and distance from nearest drainage (DFND). This flood hazard mapping method is tested on a smaller area around the city of Calgary, Alberta, against a flood inundation map produced by the city using hydraulic modelling. Second, a flood exposure map of Canada is developed using a land-use map and the satellite-based nightlight luminosity data as two exposure parameters. Third, an economic flood risk map is produced, and subsequently overlaid with population density information to produce a socioeconomic flood risk map for Canada. All three maps of hazard, exposure, and risk are classified into five classes, ranging from very low to severe. A simple way to include flood protection measures in hazard estimation is also demonstrated using the example of the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. This could be done for the entire country if information on flood protection across Canada were available. The evaluation of the flood hazard map shows that the topography-based method adopted in this study is both practical and reliable for large-scale analysis. Sensitivity analysis regarding the resolution of the digital elevation model is needed to identify the resolution that is fine enough for reliable hazard mapping, but coarse enough for computational tractability. The nightlight data are found to be useful for exposure and risk mapping in Canada; however, uncertainty analysis should be conducted to investigate the effect of the overglow phenomenon on flood risk mapping. © Author(s) 2017.

However, the DDWW pattern is dominated by oceanic areas; recent studies based on both observed and modelled data have failed to verify the DDWW pattern on land. This study confirms the existence of a new DDWW pattern in China after analysing the observed streamflow data from 291 Chinese catchments from 1956 to 2000, which reveal that the distribution of water resources has become increasingly uneven since the 1950s. This pattern can be more accurately described as ""drier regions are more likely to become drier, whereas wetter regions are more likely to become wetter"". Based on a framework derived from the Budyko hypothesis, this study estimates runoff trends via observations of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (Ep) and predicts the future trends from 2001 to 2050 according to the projections of five GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under three scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The results show that this framework has a good performance for estimating runoff trends; such changes in P play the most significant role. Most areas of China, including more than 60% of catchments, will experience water resource shortages under the projected climate changes. Despite the differences among the predicted results of the different models, the DDWW pattern does not hold in the projections regardless of the model used. Nevertheless, this conclusion remains tentative owing to the large uncertainties in the GCM outputs.","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:39","2018-01-19 22:58:39","","2233-2248","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Runoff; Water resources; potential evapotranspiration; streamflow; water availability; climate modeling; Global climate model; climate change; Climate models; water resource; runoff; Driers (materials); Catchments; global climate; precipitation (climatology); hydrometeorology; Potential evapotranspiration; CMIP; Water availability; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Distribution of water; Future trends; Resource shortage; WETTING AND DRYING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the nonlinearities in the models, the results are very sensitive to the quality of the meteorological forcing; thus, high-quality gridded datasets of screen-level meteorological variables are needed. Precipitation datasets are particularly difficult to produce due to the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of that variable. They do, however, have a large impact on the simulations, and it is thus necessary to carefully evaluate their quality in great detail. <br><br> This paper reports the quality of two high-resolution precipitation datasets for Spain at the daily time scale: the new SAFRAN-based dataset and Spain02. SAFRAN is a meteorological analysis system that was designed to force LSMs and has recently been extended to the entirety of Spain for a long period of time (1979/1980&ndash;2013/2014). Spain02 is a daily precipitation dataset for Spain and was created mainly to validate regional climate models. In addition, ERA-Interim is included in the comparison to show the differences between local high-resolution and global low-resolution products. The study compares the different precipitation analyses with rain gauge data and assesses their temporal and spatial similarities to the observations. <br><br> The validation of SAFRAN with independent data shows that this is a robust product. SAFRAN and Spain02 have very similar scores, although the latter slightly surpasses the former. The scores are robust with altitude and throughout the year, save perhaps in summer when a diminished skill is observed. As expected, SAFRAN and Spain02 perform better than ERA-Interim, which has difficulty capturing the effects of the relief on precipitation due to its low resolution. However, ERA-Interim reproduces spells remarkably well in contrast to the low skill shown by the high-resolution products. The high-resolution gridded products overestimate the number of precipitation days, which is a problem that affects SAFRAN more than Spain02 and is likely caused by the interpolation method. Both SAFRAN and Spain02 underestimate high precipitation events, but SAFRAN does so more than Spain02. The overestimation of low precipitation events and the underestimation of intense episodes will probably have hydrological consequences once the data are used to force a land surface or hydrological model. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:45","2018-01-19 22:58:45","","2187-2201","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; hydrological cycle; climate modeling; land surface; regional climate; Spain; heterogeneity; Climate models; Surface measurement; comparative study; data interpretation; model validation; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrological modeling; Quality control; estimation method; precipitation (climatology); Gages; Regional climate models; Rain gages; Precipitation products; Meteorological forcing; Meteorological variables; Interpolation method; Meteorological analysis; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The applied climate datasets were performed in the framework of the COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-Africa) project. After evaluation of the historical runs of the climate models' ensemble, a statistical bias correction (empirical quantile mapping) was applied to daily precipitation. Temperature and bias corrected precipitation data from the ensemble of RCMs-GCMs was then used as input for the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) to simulate water balance components. The mean hydrological and climate variables for two periods (1971-2000 and 2021-2050) were compared to assess the potential impact of climate change on water resources up to the middle of the 21st century under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The results indicate (i) a clear signal of temperature increase of about 0.1 to 2.6 °C for all members of the RCM-GCM ensemble; (ii) high uncertainty about how the catchment precipitation will evolve over the period 2021-2050; (iii) the applied bias correction method only affected the magnitude of the climate change signal; (iv) individual climate models results lead to opposite discharge change signals; and (v) the results for the RCM-GCM ensemble are too uncertain to give any clear direction for future hydrological development. Therefore, potential increase and decrease in future discharge have to be considered in climate change adaptation strategies in the catchment. The results further underline on the one hand the need for a larger ensemble of projections to properly estimate the impacts of climate change on water resources in the catchment and on the other hand the high uncertainty associated with climate projections for the West African region.

However, research into the consistency of these products for various regions has been limited and in many cases non-existent. This study inter-compares several gridded precipitation products over 15 terrestrial ecozones in Canada for different seasons. The spatial and temporal variability of the errors (relative to station observations) was quantified over the period of 1979 to 2012 at a 0.5° and daily spatio-temporal resolution. These datasets were assessed in their ability to represent the daily variability of precipitation amounts by four performance measures: percentage of bias, root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation ratio. Results showed that most of the datasets were relatively skilful in central Canada. However, they tended to overestimate precipitation amounts in the west and underestimate in the north and east, with the underestimation being particularly dominant in northern Canada (above 60°N). The global product by WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI) augmented by Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data (WFDEI [GPCC]) performed best with respect to different metrics. The Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA) product performed comparably with WFDEI [GPCC]; however, it only provides data starting in 2002.

Using a global sensitivity analysis, this study assessed the implications of baseline climate conditions on the sensitivity of PET to a large range of plausible changes in temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (Rs) and wind speed (uz). The analysis was conducted at 30 Australian locations representing different climatic zones, using the Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor PET models. Results from both models suggest that the baseline climate can have a substantial impact on overall PET sensitivity. In particular, approximately 2-fold greater changes in PET were observed in cool-climate energy-limited locations compared to other locations in Australia, indicating the potential for elevated water loss as a result of increasing actual evapotranspiration (AET) in these locations. The two PET models consistently indicated temperature to be the most important variable for PET, but showed large differences in the relative importance of the remaining climate variables. In particular for the Penman-Monteith model, wind and relative humidity were the second-most important variables for dry and humid catchments, respectively, whereas for the Priestley-Taylor model solar radiation was the second-most important variable, with the greatest influence in warmer catchments. This information can be useful to inform the selection of suitable PET models to estimate future PET for different climate conditions, providing evidence on both the structural plausibility and input uncertainty for the alternative models. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:53","2018-01-19 22:58:53","","2107-2126","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; catchment; potential evapotranspiration; solar radiation; temperature; sensitivity analysis; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Climate models; Global sensitivity analysis; Catchments; wind velocity; water budget; Location; Actual evapotranspiration; Potential evapotranspiration; Catchment water balance; Different climatic zones; climatic region; Penman-Monteith equation; baseline conditions; Climate condition; Input uncertainty; Penman-Monteith models; relative humidity; Solar radiation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of its importance for sustainable water use and food security, the changing patterns of streamflow and its association with climate change is not well understood. This study aims to improve the understanding of the linkages between rainfall and streamflow trends and identify possible drivers of streamflow variabilities in the basin. Trend analyses and change-point detections of rainfall and streamflow were analysed using Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests, respectively, using data records for 21 rainfall and 9 streamflow stations. The nature of changes and linkages between rainfall and streamflow were carefully examined for monthly, seasonal and annual flows, as well as indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). The trend and change-point analyses found that 19 of the tested 21 rainfall stations did not show statistically significant changes. In contrast, trend analyses on the streamflow showed both significant increasing and decreasing patterns. A decreasing trend in the dry season (October to February), short season (March to May), main rainy season (June to September) and annual totals is dominant in six out of the nine stations. Only one out of nine gauging stations experienced significant increasing flow in the dry and short rainy seasons, attributed to the construction of Tekezē hydropower dam upstream this station in 2009. Overall, streamflow trends and change-point timings were found to be inconsistent among the stations. Changes in streamflow without significant change in rainfall suggests factors other than rainfall drive the change. Most likely the observed changes in streamflow regimes could be due to changes in catchment characteristics of the basin. Further studies are needed to verify and quantify the hydrological changes shown in statistical tests by identifying the physical mechanisms behind those changes. The findings from this study are useful as a prerequisite for studying the effects of catchment management dynamics on the hydrological variabilities in the basin. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:55","2018-01-19 22:58:55","","2127-2142","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Runoff; rainfall; streamflow; trend analysis; climate change; Ethiopia; Floods; Food supply; spatiotemporal analysis; Water conservation; Catchments; flow measurement; Digital storage; Stream flow; Nile Basin; Hydrological variability; Catchment characteristics; Temporal and spatial variability; Atbara River; Change point detection; Change-point analysis; detection method; hydroelectric power plant; Indicators of hydrologic alteration (iha); Streamflow variability; Tekeze River; Temporal and spatial changes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of the focus has been on water scarcity and competition for the resource between agriculture, urban users, ecology and industry. However, water risks are multi-dimensional. Water-related hazards include flooding due to extreme rainfall, persistent drought and pollution, either due to industrial operations themselves, or to the failure of infrastructure. Most companies have risk management plans at each operational location to address these risks to a certain design level. The residual risk may or may not be managed, and is typically not quantified at a portfolio scale, i.e. across many sites. Given that climate is the driver of many of these extreme events, and there is evidence of quasi-periodic climate regimes at inter-annual and decadal timescales, it is possible that a portfolio is subject to persistent, multi-year exceedances of the design level. In other words, for a multi-national corporation, it is possible that there is correlation in the climate-induced portfolio water risk across its operational sites as multiple sites may experience a hazard beyond the design level in a given year. Therefore, from an investor's perspective, a need exists for a water risk index that allows for an exploration of the possible space and/or time clustering in exposure across many sites contained in a portfolio. This paper represents a first attempt to develop an index for financial exposure of a geographically diversified, global portfolio to the time-varying risk of climatic extremes using long daily global rainfall datasets derived from climate re-analysis models. Focusing on extreme daily rainfall amounts and using examples from major mining companies, we illustrate how the index can be developed. We discuss how companies can use it to explore their corporate exposure, and what they may need to disclose to investors and regulators to promote transparency as to risk exposure and mitigation efforts. For the examples of mining companies provided, we note that the actual exposure is substantially higher than would be expected in the absence of space and time correlation of risk as is usually tacitly assumed. We also find evidence for the increasing exposure to climate-induced risk, and for decadal variability in exposure. The relative vulnerability of different portfolios to multiple extreme events in a given year is also demonstrated. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:58:58","2018-01-19 22:58:58","","2075-2106","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","finance; Rain; Risk assessment; rainfall; water availability; Climatology; data set; Risk management; Risk perception; Climate models; risk assessment; Water pollution; mining industry; Hazards; conceptual framework; extreme event; climate effect; index method; Nongovernmental organizations; Risk management plans; Competition; Daily rainfall amounts; Decadal variability; Industrial operations; Multi-national corporations; Space and time correlations; Time-varying risks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imperfections in model physics, uncertainties in model land parameters and meteorological data, as well as the human impact on land changes often limit the accuracy of hydrological models in estimating water storages. To mitigate this problem, this study investigated the assimilation of terrestrial water storage variation (TWSV) estimates derived from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) data using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach. The region considered was the Hexi Corridor in northern China. The hydrological model used for the analysis was PCR-GLOBWB, driven by satellite-based forcing data from April 2002 to December 2010. The impact of the GRACE data assimilation (DA) scheme was evaluated in terms of the TWSV, as well as the variation of individual hydrological storage estimates. The capability of GRACE DA to adjust the storage level was apparent not only for the entire TWSV but also for the groundwater component. In this study, spatially correlated errors in GRACE data were taken into account, utilizing the full error variance-covariance matrices provided as a part of the GRACE data product. The benefits of this approach were demonstrated by comparing the EnKF results obtained with and without taking into account error correlations. The results were validated against in situ groundwater data from five well sites. On average, the experiments showed that GRACE DA improved the accuracy of groundwater storage estimates by as much as 25 %. The inclusion of error correlations provided an equal or greater improvement in the estimates. In contrast, a validation against in situ streamflow data from two river gauges showed no significant benefits of GRACE DA. This is likely due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of GRACE observations. Finally, results of the GRACE DA study were used to assess the status of water resources over the Hexi Corridor over the considered 9-year time interval. Areally averaged values revealed that TWS, soil moisture, and groundwater storages over the region decreased with an average rate of approximately 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1 cm yr-1 in terms of equivalent water heights, respectively. A particularly rapid decline in TWS (approximately -0.4 cm yr-1) was seen over the Shiyang River basin located in the southeastern part of Hexi Corridor. The reduction mostly occurred in the groundwater layer. An investigation of the relationship between water resources and agricultural activities suggested that groundwater consumption required to maintain crop yield in the growing season for this specific basin was likely the cause of the groundwater depletion. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:00","2018-01-19 22:59:00","","2053-2074","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Covariance matrix; China; Water resources; groundwater; satellite data; soil moisture; streamflow; GRACE; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; Meteorology; Agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; Water conservation; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; water storage; Digital storage; Spatial and temporal resolutions; error analysis; Errors; Kalman filter; semiarid region; resource assessment; Arid regions; Gansu; Geodetic satellites; Terrestrial water storage; Agricultural activities; Gravity recovery and climate experiment datum; Groundwater consumption; Groundwater depletion; Hexi Corridor; polymerase chain reaction; Shiyang River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predicting flow changes associated with urbanisation is not straightforward, as they are influenced by interactions between impervious cover, basin size, drainage connectivity and stormwater management infrastructure. In this study, we present an alternative approach to statistical analysis of hydrological response variability and basin flashiness, based on the distribution of inter-Amount times. We analyse inter-Amount time distributions of high-resolution streamflow time series for 17 (semi-)urbanised basins in North Carolina, USA, ranging from 13 to 238 km2 in size. We show that in the inter-Amount-Time framework, sampling frequency is tuned to the local variability of the flow pattern, resulting in a different representation and weighting of high and low flow periods in the statistical distribution. This leads to important differences in the way the distribution quantiles, mean, coefficient of variation and skewness vary across scales and results in lower mean intermittency and improved scaling. Moreover, we show that inter-Amount-Time distributions can be used to detect regulation effects on flow patterns, identify critical sampling scales and characterise flashiness of hydrological response. The possibility to use both the classical approach and the inter-Amount-Time framework to identify minimum observable scales and analyse flow data opens up interesting areas for future research. © Author(s) 2017.

SIM consists of three stages: (1) an atmospheric reanalysis (SAFRAN) over France, which forces (2) the three-layer ISBA land surface model, which then provides drainage and runoff inputs to (3) the MODCOU hydro-geological model. The drainage and runoff outputs from ISBA are validated by comparing the simulated river discharge from MODCOU with over 500 river-gauge observations over France and with a subset of stations with low-anthropogenic influence, over several years. This study makes use of the A-gs version of ISBA that allows for physiological processes. The atmospheric forcing for the ISBA-A-gs model underestimates direct shortwave and long-wave radiation by approximately 5ĝ€†<i>%</i> averaged over France. The ISBA-A-gs model also substantially underestimates the grassland LAI compared with satellite retrievals during winter dormancy. These differences result in an underestimation (overestimation) of evapotranspiration (drainage and runoff). The excess runoff flowing into the rivers and aquifers contributes to an overestimation of the SIM river discharge. Two experiments attempted to resolve these problems: (i) a correction of the minimum LAI model parameter for grasslands and (ii) a bias-correction of the model radiative forcing. Two data assimilation experiments were also performed, which are designed to correct random errors in the initial conditions: (iii) the assimilation of LAI observations and (iv) the assimilation of SSM and LAI observations. The data assimilation for (iii) and (iv) was done with a simplified extended Kalman filter (SEKF), which uses finite differences in the observation operator Jacobians to relate the observations to the model variables. Experiments (i) and (ii) improved the median SIM Nash scores by about 9ĝ€†<i>%</i> and 18ĝ€†<i>%</i> respectively. Experiment (iii) reduced the LAI phase errors in ISBA-A-gs but had little impact on the discharge Nash efficiency of SIM. In contrast, experiment (iv) resulted in spurious increases in drainage and runoff, which degraded the median discharge Nash efficiency by about 7ĝ€†<i>%</i>. The poor performance of the SEKF originates from the observation operator Jacobians. These Jacobians are dampened when the soil is saturated and when the vegetation is dormant, which leads to positive biases in drainage and/or runoff and to insufficient corrections during winter, respectively. Possible ways to improve the model are discussed, including a new multi-layer diffusion model and a more realistic response of photosynthesis to temperature in mountainous regions. The data assimilation should be advanced by accounting for model and forcing uncertainties. © The Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:06","2018-01-19 22:59:06","","2015-2033","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Vegetation; evapotranspiration; river discharge; satellite data; simulation; soil moisture; streamflow; land surface; data assimilation; Hydrogeology; Rivers; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; Surface measurement; Aquifers; runoff; France; Efficiency; Soil moisture; Soils; Physiological process; Land surface modeling; correction; drainage; Moisture; leaf area index; Streamflow simulations; Atmospheric radiation; Surface soil moisture; Land data assimilation; Anthropogenic influence; atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric reanalysis; Observation operator; Random errors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thereby quality of DOM affects function and behavior of DOM in aquatic ecosystems, but DOM quality can also help to track DOM sources and their export dynamics under specific hydrologic preconditions. The objective of this study was to elucidate controls on temporal variability in DOM concentration and quality in stream water draining a bog and a forested peaty riparian zone, particularly considering drought and storm flow events. DOM quality was monitored using spectrofluorometric indices for aromaticity (SUVA254), apparent molecular size (SR) and precursor organic material (FI), as well as PARAFAC modeling of excitation emission matrices (EEMs). Indices for DOM quality exhibited major changes due to different hydrologic conditions, but patterns were also dependent on season. Stream water at the forested site with mineral, peaty soils generally exhibited higher variability in DOM concentrations and quality compared to the outflow of an ombrotrophic bog, where DOM was less susceptible to changes in hydrologic conditions. During snowmelt and spring events, near-surface protein-like DOM pools were exported. A microbial DOM fraction originating from groundwater and deep peat layers was increasing during drought, while a strongly microbially altered DOM fraction was also exported by discharge events with dry preconditions at the forested site. This might be due to accelerated microbial activity in the peaty riparian zone of the forested site under these preconditions. Our study demonstrated that DOM export dynamics are not only a passive mixing of different hydrological sources, but monitoring studies have to consider that DOM quality depends on hydrologic preconditions and season. Moreover, the forested peaty riparian zone generated the most variability in headwater DOM quantity and quality, as could be tracked by the used spectrofluorometric indices. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:08","2018-01-19 22:59:08","","2035-2051","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","discharge; drought; groundwater; seasonality; Drought; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Aquatic ecosystems; Forestry; Biogeochemistry; riparian zone; Quality control; microbial activity; Dynamics; snowmelt; Wetlands; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; groundwater-surface water interaction; Temporal variability; Biological materials; dissolved organic matter; Organic compounds; headwater; Dissolved organic matters; Hydrologic conditions; outflow; Dynamics and control; Excitation emission matrices; Headwater stream; Microbial activities; Organic materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the terms in the hydrologic budget, precipitation is typically the most important input; however, measurements of precipitation are subject to large errors and biases. For example, an all-weather unshielded weighing precipitation gauge can collect less than 50% of the actual amount of solid precipitation when wind speeds exceed 5ms-1. Using results from two different precipitation test beds, such errors have been assessed for unshielded weighing gauges and for weighing gauges employing four of the most common windshields currently in use. Functions to correct wind-induced undercatch were developed and tested. In addition, corrections for the single-Alter weighing gauge were developed using the combined results of two separate sites in Norway and the USA. In general, the results indicate that the functions effectively correct the undercatch bias that affects such precipitation measurements. In addition, a single function developed for the single-Alter gauges effectively decreased the bias at both sites, with the bias at the US site improving from -12 to 0 %, and the bias at the Norwegian site improving from -27 to -4 %. These correction functions require only wind speed and air temperature as inputs, and were developed for use in national and local precipitation networks, hydrological monitoring, roadway and airport safety work, and climate change research.

This event has recently been studied from meteorological and streamflow perspective, but no analysis of the groundwater situation has been performed. One of the reasons is that real-Time groundwater level observations often are not available. In this study, we evaluate two alternative approaches to quantify the 2015 groundwater drought over two regions in southern Germany and eastern Netherlands. The first approach is based on spatially explicit relationships between meteorological conditions and historic groundwater level observations. The second approach uses the Gravity Recovery Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater anomalies derived from GRACE-TWS and (near-)surface storage simulations by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) models. We combined the monthly groundwater observations from 2040 wells to establish the spatially varying optimal accumulation period between the Standardised Groundwater Index (SGI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at a 0.25° gridded scale. The resulting optimal accumulation periods range between 1 and more than 24 months, indicating strong spatial differences in groundwater response time to meteorological input over the region. Based on the estimated optimal accumulation periods and available meteorological time series, we reconstructed the groundwater anomalies up to 2015 and found that in Germany a uniform severe groundwater drought persisted for several months during this year, whereas the Netherlands appeared to have relatively high groundwater levels. The differences between this event and the 2003 European benchmark drought are striking. The 2003 groundwater drought was less uniformly pronounced, both in the Netherlands and Germany. This is because slowly responding wells (the ones with optimal accumulation periods of more than 12 months) still were above average from the wet year of 2002, which experienced severe flooding in central Europe. GRACE-TWS and GRACE-based groundwater anomalies did not capture the spatial variability of the 2003 and 2015 drought events satisfactorily. GRACE-TWS did show that both 2003 and 2015 were relatively dry, but the differences between Germany and the Netherlands in 2015 and the spatially variable groundwater drought pattern in 2003 were not captured. This could be associated with the coarse spatial scale of GRACE. The simulated groundwater anomalies based on GRACE-TWS deviated considerably from the GRACE-TWS signal and from observed groundwater anomalies. The uncertainty in the GRACE-based groundwater anomalies mainly results from uncertainties in the simulation of soil moisture by the different GLDAS models. The GRACE-based groundwater anomalies are therefore not suitable for use in real-Time groundwater drought monitoring in our case study regions. The alternative approach based on the spatially variable relationship between meteorological conditions and groundwater levels is more suitable to quantify groundwater drought in near real-Time. Compared to the meteorological drought and streamflow drought (described in previous studies), the groundwater drought of 2015 had a more pronounced spatial variability in its response to meteorological conditions, with some areas primarily influenced by short-Term meteorological deficits and others influenced by meteorological deficits accumulated over the preceding 2 years or more. In drought management, this information is very useful and our approach to quantify groundwater drought can be used until real-Time groundwater observations become readily available.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:14","2018-01-19 22:59:14","","1947-1971","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Land data assimilation systems; drought; evapotranspiration; groundwater; satellite data; soil moisture; streamflow; GRACE; Meteorological drought; Drought; standardization; flooding; Climate models; Groundwater; Netherlands; Water supply; testing method; meteorology; Soil moisture; spatial variation; water storage; Digital storage; real time; water level; Stream flow; Meteorological condition; Meteorological input; Geodetic satellites; Terrestrial water storage; Simulated ground water; Central and Eastern Europe; Eastern Europe; Variable relationships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Now it is becoming controversial whether the recovery construction involving vegetation, particularly forest, is reducing the streamflow in the rivers of the Yellow River basin. In this study, we chose the Wei River, the largest branch of the Yellow River, with revegetated construction area as the study area. To do that, we apply the widely used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the upper and middle reaches of the Wei River basin. The SWAT model was forced with daily observed meteorological forcings (1960-2009) calibrated against daily streamflow for 1960-1969, validated for the period of 1970-1979, and used for analysis for 1980-2009. To investigate the impact of LUCC (land use and land cover change) on the streamflow, we firstly use two observed land use maps from 1980 and 2005 that are based on national land survey statistics merged with satellite observations. We found that the mean streamflow generated by using the 2005 land use map decreased in comparison with that using the 1980 one, with the same meteorological forcings. Of particular interest here is that the streamflow decreased on agricultural land but increased in forest areas. More specifically, the surface runoff, soil flow, and baseflow all decreased on agricultural land, while the soil flow and baseflow of forest areas increased. To investigate that, we then designed five scenarios: (S1) the present land use (1980) and (S2) 10%, (S3) 20%, (S4) 40%, and (S5) 100% of agricultural land that was converted into mixed forest. We found that the streamflow consistently increased with agricultural land converted into forest by about 7.4mm per 10%. Our modeling results suggest that forest recovery construction has a positive impact on both soil flow and baseflow by compensating for reduced surface runoff, which leads to a slight increase in the streamflow in the Wei River with the mixed landscapes on the Loess Plateau that include earth-rock mountain area. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:17","2018-01-19 22:59:17","","1929-1945","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; Vegetation; streamflow; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Sediments; vegetation cover; Land use; Agriculture; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds; Land use and land cover change; Soil and water assessment tool; Recovery; Water conservation; Forestry; Soils; Landforms; land use change; Soil conservation; agricultural land; Agricultural land; Stream flow; Loess Plateau; satellite imagery; Yellow River Basin; Agricultural runoff; Vegetation recovery; Satellite observations; Grain for green projects; Soil and water conservation; Wei Basin; Yellow River basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, planning for climate change impacts on water resource discharges is essential. We used a physically based distributed hydrological model, Shetran, to simulate discharge in the Yangtze River just below the Three Gorges Dam at Yichang (1 007 200 km2), obtaining an excellent match between simulated and measured daily discharge, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.95 for the calibration period (1996-2000) and 0.92 for the validation period (2001-2005). We then used a simple monthly delta change approach for 78 climate model projections (35 different general circulation models-GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to examine the effect of climate change on river discharge for 2041-2070 for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Projected changes to the basin's annual precipitation varied between-3.6 and +14.8 % but increases in temperature and consequently evapotranspiration (calculated using the Thornthwaite equation) were projected by all CMIP5 models, resulting in projected changes in the basin's annual discharge from-29.8 to +16.0 %. These large differences were mainly due to the predicted expansion of the summer monsoon north and west into the Yangtze Basin in some CMIP5 models, e.g. CanESM2, but not in others, e.g. CSIRO-Mk3-6-0. This was despite both models being able to simulate current climate well.

We (i) investigated the characteristic seasonal temperature patterns and recent trends in the thermal and stratification regimes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and (ii) tested the performance of the one-dimensional lake parameterization scheme FLake for the Tibetan lake system. For this purpose, we combined 3 years of in situ lake temperature measurements, several decades of satellite observations, and the global reanalysis data. We chose the two largest freshwater Tibetan lakes, Ngoring and Gyaring, as study sites. The lake model FLake faithfully reproduced the specific features of the high-altitude lakes and was subsequently applied to reconstruct the vertically resolved heat transport in both lakes during the last 4 decades. The model suggested that Ngoring and Gyaring were ice-covered for about 6 months and stratified in summer for about 4 months per year with a short spring overturn and a longer autumn overturn. In summer the surface mixed boundary layer extended to 6-8 m of depth and was about 20 % shallower in the more turbid Gyaring. The thermal regime of the transparent Ngoring responded more strongly to atmospheric forcing than Gyaring, where the higher turbidity damped the response. According to the reanalysis data, air temperatures and humidity have increased, whereas solar radiation has decreased, since the 1970s. Surprisingly, the modeled mean lake temperatures did not change, nor did the phenology of the ice cover or stratification. Lake surface temperatures in summer increased only marginally. The reason is that the increase in air temperature was offset by the decrease in radiation, probably due to increasing humidity. This study demonstrates that air temperature trends are not directly coupled to lake temperatures and underscores the importance of shortwave radiation for the thermal regime of high-altitude lakes. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:22","2018-01-19 22:59:22","","1895-1909","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; solar radiation; trend analysis; climate change; parameterization; Boundary layers; seasonal variation; Lakes; boundary layer; Parameterization schemes; air temperature; Atmospheric temperature; stratification; Atmospheric humidity; Short-wave radiation; shortwave radiation; ice cover; lacustrine environment; Temperature measurement; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; humidity; temperature profile; Satellite observations; atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric forcing; Gyaring Lake; Lake surface temperature; Lake temperatures; Ngoring Lake; overturn; Qinghai; Seasonal temperature; thermal regime; Tibetan Plateau; turbidity; upland region","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This correlation forms the base of the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture estimation method. The method is, however, complicated by the fact that several hydrogen pools other than soil moisture affect the neutron intensity. In order to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture estimation method and explore the potential for additional applications, knowledge about the environmental effect on cosmic-ray neutron intensity is essential (e.g., the effect of vegetation, litter layer and soil type). In this study the environmental effect is examined by performing a sensitivity analysis using neutron transport modeling. We use a neutron transport model with various representations of the forest and different parameters describing the subsurface to match measured height profiles and time series of thermal and epithermal neutron intensities at a field site in Denmark. Overall, modeled thermal and epithermal neutron intensities are in satisfactory agreement with measurements; however, the choice of forest canopy conceptualization is found to be significant. Modeling results show that the effect of canopy interception, soil chemistry and dry bulk density of litter and mineral soil on neutron intensity is small. On the other hand, the neutron intensity decreases significantly with added litter-layer thickness, especially for epithermal neutron energies. Forest biomass also has a significant influence on the neutron intensity height profiles at the examined field site, altering both the shape of the profiles and the ground-level thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio. This ratio increases with increasing amounts of biomass, and was confirmed by measurements from three sites representing agricultural, heathland and forest land cover. A much smaller effect of canopy interception on the ground-level thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratio was modeled. Overall, the results suggest a potential to use ground-level thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratios to discriminate the effect of different hydrogen contributions on the neutron signal. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:25","2018-01-19 22:59:25","","1875-1894","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Denmark; Sensitivity analysis; forest canopy; soil moisture; sensitivity analysis; Environmental conditions; Forestry; Soil moisture; Soils; bulk density; estimation method; Moisture; environmental conditions; cosmic ray; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Canopy interception; interception; measurement method; Cosmic ray neutron; Neutron intensities; Neutrons; Biomass; biomass; transport process; Soil moisture estimation; Dry bulk densities; environmental effect; Epithermal neutron; forest soil; fundamental particle; hydrogen; Neutron flux; Neutron transport; Transport properties; Upper atmosphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This opens up a new possibility of dynamically monitoring unsteady flows (i.e., hysteresis) during the course of flood wave propagation. Hysteresis in this context refers to a looped stage&ndash;discharge rating caused by unsteadiness of flows. Hysteresis is monitored in this study using a continuous slope area (CSA) method, which uses Manning's equation to calculate unsteady discharges based on continuously measured water surface slopes. In the rising stage, water surface slopes become steeper than a steady water surface slope, resulting in higher discharges than steady-based discharges, while the trends are reversed in the falling stage. The CSA method applied to Clear Creek near Oxford (Iowa, USA) estimates the maximum differences of peak discharges by 30&ndash;40ĝ€%, while it shows sound agreements for a low to medium range of discharges against USGS steady-based records. The primary cause of these differences is the use of a single channel bed slope in deriving Manning's roughness coefficients. The use of a single channel bed slope (conceptually equal to the water surface slopes at every stage in uniform flow conditions) causes substantial errors in estimating the channel roughness, specifically at high stages, because non-uniformities of natural channels result in varying (non-uniform) steady water surface slopes at each stage. While the CSA method is promising for dynamically tracking unsteady water surface slopes and flows in natural streams, more studies are still needed to increase the accuracy of the CSA method in future research.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:27","2018-01-19 22:59:27","","1863-1874","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom; United States; streamflow; tracking; Continuous measurements; slope; Iowa; roughness; England; flood wave; Water surface elevations; open channel flow; Open channel flow; Channel roughness; Clear Creek [Iowa]; Flood wave propagation; Hysteresis; low pressure; Manning's equations; Manning's roughness coefficient; Oxford; Oxfordshire; Substantial errors; Surface discharges; unsteady flow; Unsteady open channel flows; Wave propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These datasets include the Canadian Precipitation Analysis and the thin-plate smoothing splines (ANUSPLIN), North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), University of Washington (UW) and Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) gridded products. Uncertainties are evaluated at different stages of the VIC implementation, starting with the driving datasets, optimization of model parameters, and model calibration during cool and warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). <br><br> The inter-comparison of the forcing datasets (precipitation and air temperature) and their VIC simulations (snow water equivalent &ndash; SWE &ndash; and runoff) reveals widespread differences over the FRB, especially in mountainous regions. The ANUSPLIN precipitation shows a considerable dry bias in the Rocky Mountains, whereas the NARR winter air temperature is 2°C warmer than the other datasets over most of the FRB. In the VIC simulations, the elevation-dependent changes in the maximum SWE (maxSWE) are more prominent at higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains, where the PCIC-VIC simulation accumulates too much SWE and ANUSPLIN-VIC yields an underestimation. Additionally, at each elevation range, the day of maxSWE varies from 10 to 20 days between the VIC simulations. The snow melting season begins early in the NARR-VIC simulation, whereas the PCIC-VIC simulation delays the melting, indicating seasonal uncertainty in SWE simulations. When compared with the observed runoff for the Fraser River main stem at Hope, BC, the ANUSPLIN-VIC simulation shows considerable underestimation of runoff throughout the water year owing to reduced precipitation in the ANUSPLIN forcing dataset. The NARR-VIC simulation yields more winter and spring runoff and earlier decline of flows in summer due to a nearly 15-day earlier onset of the FRB springtime snowmelt. <br><br> Analysis of the parametric uncertainty in the VIC calibration process shows that the choice of the initial parameter range plays a crucial role in defining the model hydrological response for the FRB. Furthermore, the VIC calibration process is biased toward cool and warm phases of the PDO and the choice of proper calibration and validation time periods is important for the experimental setup. Overall the VIC hydrological response is prominently influenced by the uncertainties involved in the forcing datasets rather than those in its parameter optimization and experimental setups. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:30","2018-01-19 22:59:30","","1827-1847","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Snow; United States; optimization; data set; British Columbia; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Uncertainty analysis; Rivers; Climate models; runoff; calibration; Watersheds; Canada; Hydrology; Calibration and validations; climate effect; hydrological response; Rocky Mountains; Stream flow; air temperature; Snow melting systems; Atmospheric temperature; Variable infiltration capacity models; snow water equivalent; Washington [United States]; Pacific decadal oscillation; Fraser Basin; Melting; Parameter optimization; Parametric uncertainties; Thin plate smoothing splines; University of Washington","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analyses are based on parallel measurements carried out with these two methods at the research catchment Rietholzbach in northeastern Switzerland, and cover the time period of June 2009 to December 2015.

This highlights the representativeness of the site-level lysimeter and EC measurements for the entire catchment despite their comparatively small source areas and the heterogeneous land use and topography within the catchment. Furthermore, we identify that lack of reliable EC measurements using open-path gas analyzers during and following precipitation events (due to limitations of the measurement technique under these conditions) significantly contributes to an underestimation of EEC and to the overall energy balance gap at the site. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:38","2018-01-19 22:59:38","","1809-1825","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; evapotranspiration; time series analysis; lysimeter; Land use; comparative study; accuracy assessment; Catchments; Soil surveys; Switzerland; energy balance; eddy covariance; Catchment water balance; measurement method; Precipitation events; Accurate measurement; Eddy covariance; Electric conductivity measurement; Flux measurements; Gas analyzers; Lysimeters; Measurement techniques; Research applications; Rietholzbach; Saint Gall [Switzerland]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because continuous large-scale observations of such variables are not feasible, hydrologic or land surface models are applied to derive them. This study aims to analyze and provide a consistent high-resolution dataset of land surface variables over Germany, accounting for uncertainties caused by equifinal model parameters. The mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) is employed to derive an ensemble (100 members) of evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and runoff generated at high spatial and temporal resolutions (4 km and daily, respectively) for the period 1951-2010. The model is cross-evaluated against the observed daily streamflow in 222 basins, which are not used for model calibration. The mean (standard deviation) of the ensemble median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency estimated for these basins is 0.68 (0.09) for daily streamflow simulations. The modeled evapotranspiration and soil moisture reasonably represent the observations from eddy covariance stations. Our analysis indicates the lowest parametric uncertainty for evapotranspiration, and the largest is observed for groundwater recharge. The uncertainty of the hydrologic variables varies over the course of a year, with the exception of evapotranspiration, which remains almost constant.

In this study, the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are used as tracers to investigate the migration processes of soil water in the unsaturated zone in an arid region of China's Loess Plateau. Samples of precipitation, soil water, plant xylems and plant roots are collected and analysed. The conservative elements deuterium (D) and oxygen (18O) are used as tracers to identify variable source and mixing processes. The mixing model is used to quantify the contribution of each end member and calculate mixing amounts. The results show that the isotopic composition of precipitation in the Anjiagou River basin is affected by isotopic fractionation due to evaporation. The isotopic compositions of soil waters are plotted between or near the local meteoric water lines, indicating that soil waters are recharged by precipitation. The soil water migration is dominated by piston-type flow in the study area and rarely preferential flow. Water migration exhibited a transformation pathway from precipitation to soil water to plant water. δ18O and δD are enriched in the shallow (&lt;20 cm depth) soil water in most soil profiles due to evaporation. The isotopic composition of xylem water is close to that of soil water at the depth of 40-60 cm. These values reflect soil water signatures associated with Caragana korshinskii Kom. uptake at the depth of 40-60 cm. Soil water from the surface soil layer (20-40 cm) comprised 6-12 % of plant xylem water, while soil water at the depth of 40-60 cm is the largest component of plant xylem water (ranging from 60 to 66 %), soil water below 60 cm depth comprised 8-14 % of plant xylem water and only 5-8 % is derived directly from precipitation. This study investigates the migration process of soil water, identifies the source of plant water and finally provides a scientific basis for identification of model structures and parameters. It can provide a scientific basis for ecological water demand, ecological restoration, and management of water resources. © The Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:43","2018-01-19 22:59:43","","1757-1767","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water management; Water resources; Ecology; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; Sediments; Groundwater; water resource; Model structures; river basin; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; vadose zone; Landforms; Plants (botany); semiarid region; arid region; Mixing; Isotopes; isotopic fractionation; Isotopic fractionations; Loess Plateau; water chemistry; isotopic composition; deuterium; meteoric water; Arid regions; Ecological restoration; China's loess plateaux; Evaporation; oxygen isotope; plant water relations; precipitation (chemistry); Restoration; Caragana korshinskii; Caragana korshinskii kom; Ecological water demand; gully erosion; Identification of model; Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes; Transformation pathways; Water piping systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, precisely predicting the effect of an approaching ROS event on runoff formation is very important. Data analyses from past ROS events have shown that a snowpack experiencing ROS can either release runoff immediately or delay it considerably. This delay is a result of refreeze of liquid water and water transport, which in turn is dependent on snow grain properties but also on the presence of structures such as ice layers or capillary barriers. During sprinkling experiments, preferential flow was found to be a process that critically impacted the timing of snowpack runoff. However, current one-dimensional operational snowpack models are not capable of addressing this phenomenon. For this study, the detailed physics-based snowpack model SNOWPACK is extended with a water transport scheme accounting for preferential flow. The implemented Richards equation solver is modified using a dual-domain approach to simulate water transport under preferential flow conditions. To validate the presented approach, we used an extensive dataset of over 100 ROS events from several locations in the European Alps, comprising meteorological and snowpack measurements as well as snow lysimeter runoff data. The model was tested under a variety of initial snowpack conditions, including cold, ripe, stratified and homogeneous snow. Results show that the model accounting for preferential flow demonstrated an improved overall performance, where in particular the onset of snowpack runoff was captured better. While the improvements were ambiguous for experiments on isothermal wet snow, they were pronounced for experiments on cold snowpacks, where field experiments found preferential flow to be especially prevalent. © The Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:46","2018-01-19 22:59:46","","1741-1756","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Snow; snowpack; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; Preferential flows; runoff; one-dimensional modeling; water flow; Field experiment; flood; climate conditions; Alps; Capillary barriers; snow; Richards equation; Grain properties; Liquid water transports; reactive oxygen species; Richards Equation; Snowpack model; Water transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent developments towards more compact and robust analyzers have now made it possible to measure chemistry and water isotopes in the field at sub-hourly frequencies over extended periods. Here, we present laboratory and field tests of a membrane-vaporization continuous water sampler coupled to a cavity ring-down spectrometer for real-time measurements of δ18O and δ2H combined with a dual-channel ion chromatograph (IC) for the synchronous analysis of major cations and anions. The precision of the isotope analyzer was typically better than 0.03 for δ18O and 0.17 for δ2H in 10 min average readings taken at intervals of 30 min. Carryover effects were less than 1.2% between isotopically contrasting water samples for 30 min sampling intervals, and instrument drift could be corrected through periodic analysis of secondary reference standards. The precision of the ion chromatograph was typically g 0.1-1 ppm or better, with relative standard deviations of 1% or better for most major ions in stream water, which is sufficient to detect subtle biogeochemical signals in catchment runoff. We installed the coupled isotope analyzer/IC system in an uninsulated hut next to a stream of a small catchment and analyzed stream water and precipitation samples every 30-min over 28 days. These high-frequency measurements facilitated a detailed comparison of event-water fractions via endmember mixing analysis with both chemical and isotope tracers. For two events with relatively dry antecedent moisture conditions, the event-water fractions were &amp;lt; 21% based on isotope tracers but were significantly overestimated (40 to 82%) by the chemical tracers. These observations, coupled with the storm-to-storm patterns in precipitation isotope inputs and the associated stream water isotope response, led to a conceptual hypothesis for runoff generation in the catchment. Under this hypothesis, the pre-event water that is mobilized by precipitation events may, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, be significantly shallower, younger, and less mineralized than the deeper, older water that feeds baseflow and thus defines the endmember used in hydrograph separation. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential advantages of capturing isotopic and hydrochemical behavior at a high frequency over extended periods that span multiple hydrologic events. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:48","2018-01-19 22:59:48","","1721-1739","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Water quality; moisture; streamflow; water quality; Rivers; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Storms; Quality control; Chemical analysis; frequency analysis; Isotopes; stable isotope; Moisture; baseflow; precision; hydrogen isotope; isotopic analysis; oxygen isotope; travel time; Travel time; artifact; Chromatography; Conceptual hypothesis; End-member mixing analysis; High frequency analysis; High frequency measurements; Hydrochemical behavior; Importance sampling; Ions; Light measurement; Precipitation samples; Real time measurements; Relative standard deviations; separation; separatism; Soot blowers; vaporization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major problems with these projections are both climate model biases and the gap between gridbox and point scale. Wong et al. (2014) developed a model to jointly bias correct and downscale precipitation at daily scales. This approach, however, relied on pairwise correspondence between predictor and predictand for calibration, and, thus, on nudged simulations which are rarely available. Here we present an extension of this approach that separates the downscaling from the bias correction and in principle is applicable to free-running GCMs/RCMs. In a first step, we bias correct RCM-simulated precipitation against gridded observations at the same scale using a parametric quantile mapping (QMgrid) approach. In a second step, we bridge the scale gap: we predict local variance employing a regression-based model with coarse-scale precipitation as a predictor. The regression model is calibrated between gridded and point-scale (station) observations. For this concept we present one specific implementation, although the optimal model may differ for each studied location. To correct the whole distribution including extreme tails we apply a mixture distribution of a gamma distribution for the precipitation mass and a generalized Pareto distribution for the extreme tail in the first step. For the second step a vector generalized linear gamma model is employed. For evaluation we adopt the perfect predictor experimental setup of VALUE. We also compare our method to the classical QM as it is usually applied, i.e., between RCM and point scale (QMpoint). Precipitation is in most cases improved by (parts of) our method across different European climates. The method generally performs better in summer than in winter and in winter best in the Mediterranean region, with a mild winter climate, and worst for continental winter climate in Mid- and eastern Europe or Scandinavia. While QMpoint performs similarly (better for continental winter) to our combined method in reducing the bias and representing heavy precipitation, it is not capable of correctly modeling point-scale spatial dependence of summer precipitation. A strength of this two-step method is that the best combination of bias correction and downscaling methods can be selected. This implies that the concept can be extended to a wide range of method combinations. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 22:59:51","2018-01-19 22:59:51","","1693-1719","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Regression analysis; Scandinavia; downscaling; climate modeling; regional climate; Climate models; calibration; Stochastic systems; Pareto principle; experimental design; precipitation (climatology); correction; Mediterranean Region; Regional climate models; Summer precipitation; Heavy precipitation; Generalized Pareto Distributions; Mediterranean region; Mixture distributions; Regression-based model; Scale precipitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The homogeneity of these delineated regions is usually tested providing a yes/no decision. However, complementary measures that are able to quantify the degree of heterogeneity of a region are needed to compare regions, evaluate the impact of particular sites, and rank the performance of different delineating methods. Well-known existing heterogeneity measures are not well-defined for ranking regions, as they entail drawbacks such as assuming a given probability distribution, providing negative values and being affected by the region size. Therefore, a framework for defining and assessing desirable properties of a heterogeneity measure in the regional hydrological context is needed. In the present study, such a framework is proposed through a four-step procedure based on Monte Carlo simulations. Several heterogeneity measures, some of which commonly known and others which are derived from recent approaches or adapted from other fields, are presented and developed to be assessed. The assumption-free Gini index applied on the at-site L-variation coefficient (L-CV) over a region led to the best results. The measure of the percentage of sites for which the regional L-CV is outside the confidence interval of the at-site L-CV is also found to be relevant, as it leads to more stable results regardless of the regional L-CV value. An illustrative application is also presented for didactical purposes, through which the subjectivity of commonly used criteria to assess the performance of different delineation methods is underlined. © Author(s) 2017.

Inverse modeling of hydrochemical data constrained by isotopic data was used here to quantitatively assess the influence of geochemical processes: at depth, the dissolution of salts from the geological formations during upward leakage without evaporation explains the transitions from CI to CT and to a first end member, a cluster of Phr (cluster I); near the surface, the dissolution of salts from sabkhas by rainwater explains another cluster of Phr (cluster II). In every case, secondary precipitation of calcite occurs during dissolution. All Phr waters result from the mixing of these two clusters together with calcite precipitation and ion exchange processes. These processes are quantitatively assessed by the PHREEQC model.

A perceived increase in extreme floods in recent years has decreased public confidence in conventional flood risk estimates; the results affect society (insurance costs), individuals (personal vulnerability) and companies (e.g. water resource managers). Here, we show how historical records from Britain have improved understanding of high-magnitude floods, by examining past spatial and temporal variability. The findings identify that whilst recent floods are notable, several comparable periods of increased flooding are identifiable historically, with periods of greater frequency (flood-rich periods). Statistically significant relationships between the British flood index, the Atlantic Meridional Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index are identified. The use of historical records identifies that the largest floods often transcend single catchments affecting regions and that the current flood-rich period is not unprecedented. © The Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:00","2018-01-19 23:00:00","","1631-1650","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","North Atlantic Oscillation; United Kingdom; Water resources; river flow; Floods; flooding; risk assessment; nature-society relations; Catchments; extreme event; Flood risks; hazard assessment; historical record; Historical records; Spatial and temporal variability; Atmospheric pressure; flood frequency; Extreme flood; Flood index; Insurance cost; insurance system; meridional circulation; North atlantic oscillation indices; Resource managers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed using statistical approaches. Three methods (multiple linear models, artificial neural networks, random forest regression trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12 months of lead time. The following four main findings result from the study. 1. There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12 months. The results show high inter-station differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0.73 (cross validated). 2. A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well-established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures and antecedent streamflow as a proxy of catchment conditions. El Ninõ and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42% explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3. Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and random forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent nonlinear relationships. 4. Employed in early warning, the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast models have a skill better than a climatological forecast, which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). Seasonal statistical forecasts in the Limpopo show promising results, and thus it is recommended to employ them as complementary to existing forecasts in order to strengthen preparedness for droughts. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:02","2018-01-19 23:00:02","","1611-1629","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Oceanography; Runoff; catchment; drought; streamflow; teleconnection; statistical analysis; Teleconnection indices; sea surface temperature; Drought; hydrological modeling; Surface properties; Forecasting; Neural networks; runoff; comparative study; weather forecasting; model validation; Catchments; Forestry; early warning system; Surface waters; Deep neural networks; Stream flow; Decision trees; Non-linear relationships; Atmospheric temperature; Hydrological droughts; Seasonal forecasting; Sea surface temperature (SST); South Africa; Coefficient of determination; Multiple linear models; Limpopo Basin; Receiver operating characteristics; Submarine geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrated models have to be comprehensive enough to cover the aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual ""iWaQa"" model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major pollutant pathways in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:05","2018-01-19 23:00:05","","1593-1609","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Decision making; Runoff; Water management; Water quality; catchment; decision analysis; climate change; water quality; water management; Uncertainty analysis; Pollution; Climate models; Land use; Water pollution; Agriculture; integrated approach; Economic and social effects; Economics; Water conservation; Catchments; Surface waters; Quality control; Population statistics; Chains; organic pollutant; Quality management; Switzerland; River pollution; Sources of uncertainty; Urban growth; Water quality parameters; nonpoint source pollution; Agricultural environments; Integrated catchment model; Integrated modelling approach; Model structure uncertainties; Organic micro-pollutants; Socio-economic development; socioeconomic status; Swiss Plateau","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When models are fed with a single uniformly distributed rainfall realization, the response of the urban drainage system to the rainfall variability remains unexplored. The goal of this study was to understand how climate variability and spatial rainfall variability, jointly or individually considered, affect the response of a calibrated hydrodynamic urban drainage model. A stochastic spatially distributed rainfall generator (STREAP - Space-Time Realizations of Areal Precipitation) was used to simulate many realizations of rainfall for a 30-year period, accounting for both climate variability and spatial rainfall variability. The generated rainfall ensemble was used as input into a calibrated hydrodynamic model (EPA SWMM - the US EPA's Storm Water Management Model) to simulate surface runoff and channel flow in a small urban catchment in the city of Lucerne, Switzerland. The variability of peak flows in response to rainfall of different return periods was evaluated at three different locations in the urban drainage network and partitioned among its sources. The main contribution to the total flow variability was found to originate from the natural climate variability (on average over 74 %). In addition, the relative contribution of the spatial rainfall variability to the total flow variability was found to increase with longer return periods. This suggests that while the use of spatially distributed rainfall data can supply valuable information for sewer network design (typically based on rainfall with return periods from 5 to 15 years), there is a more pronounced relevance when conducting flood risk assessments for larger return periods. The results show the importance of using multiple distributed rainfall realizations in urban hydrology studies to capture the total flow variability in the response of the urban drainage systems to heavy rainfall events. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:08","2018-01-19 23:00:08","","1559-1572","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Rain; Rainfall variability; Risk assessment; Runoff; Water management; catchment; design; Climatology; Floods; Climate models; runoff; hydrodynamics; Spatial distribution; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Catchments; sewer network; drainage network; Precipitation (meteorology); urban drainage; Stochastic systems; Hydrology; Urban drainage systems; Gages; Switzerland; Flood risk assessments; Rain gages; Drainage; Relative contribution; channel flow; network design; Lucerne [Switzerland]; Natural climate variabilities; Spatial rainfall variabilities; Storm water management model; Urban drainage model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four conditioning statistics based on seasonal forecasts of cumulative precipitation and the standardised precipitation index were used to select relevant traces within historical streamflows and precipitation respectively. This resulted in eight conditioned streamflow forecast scenarios. These scenarios were compared to the climatology of historical streamflows, the ensemble streamflow prediction approach and the streamflow forecasts obtained from ECMWF System 4 precipitation forecasts. The impact of conditioning was assessed in terms of forecast sharpness (spread), reliability, overall performance and low-flow event detection. Results showed that conditioning past observations on seasonal precipitation indices generally improves forecast sharpness, but may reduce reliability, with respect to climatology. Conversely, conditioned ensembles were more reliable but less sharp than streamflow forecasts derived from System 4 precipitation. Forecast attributes from conditioned and unconditioned ensembles are illustrated for a case of drought-risk forecasting: the 2003 drought in France. In the case of low-flow forecasting, conditioning results in ensembles that can better assess weekly deficit volumes and durations over a wider range of lead times. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:12","2018-01-19 23:00:12","","1573-1591","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Streamflow forecast; climatology; drought; low flow; streamflow; Climatology; seasonality; Streamflow prediction; Drought; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; France; forecasting method; precipitation assessment; Stream flow; Reservoir management; general circulation model; General circulation model; Streamflow forecasting; Cumulative precipitation; Precipitation forecast; Precipitation indices; Seasonal precipitations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivities of natural soils, the soil medium within which the soil water flow occurs is essentially anisotropic. Accordingly, in this study the fractional dimensions in two horizontal and one vertical directions are considered to be different, resulting in multi-fractional multi-dimensional soil space within which the flow takes place. Toward the development of the fractional governing equations, first a dimensionally consistent continuity equation for soil water flow in multi-dimensional fractional soil space and fractional time is developed. It is shown that the fractional soil water flow continuity equation approaches the conventional integer form of the continuity equation as the fractional derivative powers approach integer values. For the motion equation of soil water flow, or the equation of water flux within the soil matrix in multi-dimensional fractional soil space and fractional time, a dimensionally consistent equation is also developed. Again, it is shown that this fractional water flux equation approaches the conventional Darcy equation as the fractional derivative powers approach integer values. From the combination of the fractional continuity and motion equations, the governing equation of transient soil water flow in multi-dimensional fractional soil space and fractional time is obtained. It is shown that this equation approaches the conventional Richards equation as the fractional derivative powers approach integer values. Then by the introduction of the Brooks-Corey constitutive relationships for soil water into the fractional transient soil water flow equation, an explicit form of the equation is obtained in multi-dimensional fractional soil space and fractional time. The governing fractional equation is then specialized to the case of only vertical soil water flow and of only horizontal soil water flow in fractional time-space. It is shown that the developed governing equations, in their fractional time but integer space forms, show behavior consistent with the previous experimental observations concerning the diffusive behavior of soil water flow. © The Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:15","2018-01-19 23:00:15","","1547-1557","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","equation; Equations of motion; Hydraulics; water flow; Flow of water; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; hydraulic conductivity; flux measurement; anisotropy; Anisotropy; Richards equation; Anisotropic media; anisotropic medium; Constitutive relationships; Continuity equations; Diffusive behavior; Fractional derivatives; Fractional equation; Governing equations; Soil water fluxes; Time and motion study; Vertical direction; vertical distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a tremendous increase in food production, a common problem when characterizing these zones is land degradation in the form of waterlogging. A clear example of this phenomenon is in the Nubariya depression in the Western Desert of Egypt. Following the reclamation of desert lands for agricultural production, an artificial brackish and contaminated pond started to develop in the late 1990s, which at present extends for about 2.5ĝ€km2. The available data provide evidence of a simultaneous general deterioration of the groundwater system. An extensive hydrogeophysical investigation was carried out in this challenging environment using magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) and ground-based time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) techniques with the following main objectives: (1) understanding the hydrological evolution of the area; (2) characterizing the hydrogeological setting; and (3) developing scenarios for artificial aquifer remediation and recharge. The integrated interpretation of the geophysical surveys provided a hydrogeological picture of the upper 100ĝ€m sedimentary setting in terms of both lithological distribution and groundwater quality. The information is then used to set up (1) a regional groundwater flow and (2) a local density-dependent flow and transport numerical model to reproduce the evolution of the aquifer system and develop a few scenarios for artificial aquifer recharge using the treated water provided by a nearby wastewater treatment plant. The research outcomes point to the hydrological challenges that emerge for the effective management of water resources in reclaimed desert areas, and they highlight the effectiveness of using advanced geophysical and modeling methodologies. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:18","2018-01-19 23:00:18","","1527-1545","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; Water quality; Water resources; Egypt; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Agriculture; numerical model; Geophysics; groundwater flow; Irrigation; irrigation system; Landforms; human activity; Wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Wastewater treatment plants; Effective management; Recharging (underground waters); wetland; Lithology; geophysics; land degradation; Time domain analysis; Agricultural productions; electromagnetic method; Hydrogeological settings; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance sounding (MRS); Modeling methodology; Regional groundwater flow; resonance; Time domain electromagnetics; Water treatment; Western Desert","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing this stochasticity is important for the conservation of soil and water resources; however, the stochasticity of erosion event in restoration vegetation types in water-limited environment has been little investigated. In this study, we constructed an event-driven framework to quantify the stochasticity of runoff and sediment generation in three typical restoration vegetation types (<i>Armeniaca sibirica</i> (T1), <i>Spiraea pubescens</i> (T2) and <i>Artemisia copria</i> (T3)) in closed runoff plots over five rainy seasons in the Loess Plateau of China. The results indicate that, under the same rainfall condition, the average probabilities of runoff and sediment in T1 (3.8 and 1.6ĝ€%) and T3 (5.6 and 4.4ĝ€%) were lowest and highest, respectively. The binomial and Poisson probabilistic model are two effective ways to simulate the frequency distributions of times of erosion events occurring in all restoration vegetation types. The Bayes model indicated that relatively longer-duration and stronger-intensity rainfall events respectively become the main probabilistic contributors to the stochasticity of an erosion event occurring in T1 and T3. Logistic regression modelling highlighted that the higher-grade rainfall intensity and canopy structure were the two most important factors to respectively improve and restrain the probability of stochastic erosion generation in all restoration vegetation types. The Bayes, binomial, Poisson and logistic regression models constituted an integrated probabilistic assessment to systematically simulate and evaluate soil erosion stochasticity. This should prove to be an innovative and important complement in understanding soil erosion from the stochasticity viewpoint, and also provide an alternative to assess the efficacy of ecological restoration in conserving soil and water resources in a semi-arid environment. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:22","2018-01-19 23:00:22","","1491-1514","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Regression analysis; Runoff; Vegetation; Water resources; Bayesian networks; probability; vegetation cover; integrated approach; runoff; Water conservation; Erosion; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Soils; stochasticity; soil erosion; hydrological response; Soil conservation; Frequency distributions; Bins; precipitation intensity; Loess Plateau; Loess plateau of chinas; Ecological restoration; environmental restoration; Restoration; Probabilistic modeling; Artemisia; Logistic regression models; Poisson distribution; Probabilistic assessments; restoration ecology; Runoff and sediment generation; Semi-arid environments; Spiraea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The magnitude and sign of the response of ET to deforestation depend both on the magnitude and regional patterns of land-cover change (LCC), as well as on climate change and CO2 levels. On the one hand, elevated CO2 decreases leaf-scale transpiration, but this effect could be offset by increased foliar area density. Using three regional LCC scenarios specifically established for the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon, we investigate the impacts of climate change and deforestation on the surface hydrology of the Amazon Basin for this century, taking 2009 as a reference. For each LCC scenario, three land surface models (LSMs), LPJmL-DGVM, INLAND-DGVM and ORCHIDEE, are forced by bias-corrected climate simulated by three general circulation models (GCMs) of the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4). On average, over the Amazon Basin with no deforestation, the GCM results indicate a temperature increase of 3.3ĝ€°C by 2100 which drives up the evaporative demand, whereby precipitation increases by 8.5&thinsp;%, with a large uncertainty across GCMs. In the case of no deforestation, we found that ET and runoff increase by 5.0 and 14ĝ€%, respectively. However, in south-east Amazonia, precipitation decreases by 10ĝ€% at the end of the dry season and the three LSMs produce a 6ĝ€% decrease of ET, which is less than precipitation, so that runoff decreases by 22&thinsp;%. For instance, the minimum river discharge of the Rio Tapajós is reduced by 31ĝ€% in 2100. To study the additional effect of deforestation, we prescribed to the LSMs three contrasted LCC scenarios, with a forest decline going from 7 to 34ĝ€% over this century. All three scenarios partly offset the climate-induced increase of ET, and runoff increases over the entire Amazon. In the south-east, however, deforestation amplifies the decrease of ET at the end of dry season, leading to a large increase of runoff (up to +27ĝ€% in the extreme deforestation case), offsetting the negative effect of climate change, thus balancing the decrease of low flows in the Rio Tapajós. These projections are associated with large uncertainties, which we attribute separately to the differences in LSMs, GCMs and to the uncertain range of deforestation. At the subcatchment scale, the uncertainty range on ET changes is shown to first depend on GCMs, while the uncertainty of runoff projections is predominantly induced by LSM structural differences. By contrast, we found that the uncertainty in both ET and runoff changes attributable to uncertain future deforestation is low. © Author(s) 2017.

Saline-freshwater interactions are controlled by physico-chemical processes that need to be accurately modeled. This in turn requires monitoring of these systems, a non-trivial task for which spatially extensive, high-resolution non-invasive techniques can provide key information. In this paper we present the field monitoring and numerical modeling components of an approach aimed at understanding complex saline-freshwater systems. The approach is applied to a freshwater injection experiment carried out in a hyper-saline aquifer near Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). The experiment was monitored using time-lapse cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). To investigate the flow dynamics, coupled numerical flow and transport modeling of the experiment was carried out using an advanced three-dimensional (3-D) density-driven flow-transport simulator. The simulation results were used to produce synthetic ERT inversion results to be compared against real field ERT results. This exercise demonstrates that the evolution of the freshwater bulb is strongly influenced by the system's (even mild) hydraulic heterogeneities. The example also highlights how the joint use of ERT imaging and gravity-dependent flow and transport modeling give fundamental information for this type of study. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:32","2018-01-19 23:00:32","","1439-1454","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Water management; Water resources; Hydrogeology; aquifer; Aquifers; saline intrusion; water resource; numerical model; Water; three-dimensional modeling; experimental study; porous medium; flow modeling; monitoring; Sardinia; Fresh water resources; Saline water; physicochemical property; Electrical resistivity tomography; Porous materials; Semi-arid environments; Cagliari; Density driven flows; Geophysical monitoring; Noninvasive technique; Physicochemical process; Threedimensional (3-d)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The categorical forecast skill of 10 precipitation and temperature indices was investigated using the 28-year sub-seasonal hindcasts from the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The forecast skill for mean precipitation and temperature as well as for the frequency and duration of extremes was highly dependent on the forecasting indices, regions, seasons, and leads. Forecasts for 7- and 14-day temperature indices showed skill even at weeks 3 and 4, and generally were more skillful than precipitation indices. Overall, temperature indices showed higher skill than precipitation indices over the entire CONUS region at sub-seasonal scale. While the forecast skill related to mean precipitations was low in summer over the CONUS, the number of rainy days, number of consecutive rainy days, and number of consecutive dry days showed considerably high skill for the western coastal region. The presence of active Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events improved CFSv2 weekly mean precipitation forecast skill over most parts of the CONUS, but it did not necessarily improve the weekly mean temperature forecasts. The 30-day forecasts of precipitation and temperature indices calculated from the downscaled monthly CFSv2 forecasts were less skillful than those calculated directly from CFSv2 daily forecasts, suggesting the usefulness of CFSv2 for sub-seasonal hydrological forecasting. © Author(s) 2017.

However, its ecological significance has generally been underestimated because it is relatively limited in amount, and the biotic mechanisms that affect it have not been thoroughly studied at the leaf scale. This study was conducted during the 2014 and 2015 rainy seasons at the northern Loess Plateau of China. We measured the branch stemflow volume (SFb), shrub stemflow equivalent water depth (SFd), stemflow percentage of incident precipitation (SF%), stemflow productivity (SFP), funnelling ratio (FR), the meteorological characteristics and the plant traits of branches and leaves of C. korshinskii and S. psammophila. This study evaluated stemflow efficiency for the first time with the combined results of SFP and FR, and sought to determine the inter- and intra-specific differences of stemflow yield and efficiency between the two species, as well as the specific bio-/abiotic mechanisms that affected stemflow. The results indicated that C. korshinskii had a greater stemflow yield and efficiency at all precipitation levels than that of S. psammophila. The largest inter-specific difference generally occurred at the 5-10mm branches during rains of ≤ 2mm. Precipitation amount was the most influential meteorological characteristic that affected stemflow yield and efficiency in these two endemic shrub species. Branch angle was the most influential plant trait on FR. For SFb, stem biomass and leaf biomass were the most influential plant traits for C. korshinskii and S. psammophila, respectively. For SFP of these two shrub species, leaf traits (the individual leaf area) and branch traits (branch size and biomass allocation pattern) had a great influence during lighter rains ≤ 10mm and heavier rains &gt; 15mm, respectively. The lower precipitation threshold to start stemflow allowed C. korshinskii (0.9mm vs. 2.1mm for S. psammophila) to employ more rains to harvest water via stemflow. The beneficial leaf traits (e.g., leaf shape, arrangement, area, amount) might partly explain the greater stemflow production of C. korshinskii. Comparison of SFb between the foliated and manually defoliated shrubs during the 2015 rainy season indicated that the newly exposed branch surface at the defoliated period and the resulting rainfall intercepting effects might be an important mechanism affecting stemflow in the dormant season. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:38","2018-01-19 23:00:38","","1421-1438","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Ecology; comparative study; Efficiency; Soils; Plants (botany); precipitation assessment; Loess Plateau; Loess plateau of chinas; rhizosphere; abiotic factor; Intra-specific differences; Biomass; biotic factor; biomass; shrub; biomass allocation; Biomass allocation; Dormant seasons; foliation; Influential factors; Precipitation level; Precipitation threshold; stemflow; water depth; Xerophytic shrubs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The summer of 2015 was characterized by exceptionally high temperatures in many parts of central and eastern Europe, with daily maximum temperatures 2 °C higher than the seasonal mean (1971-2000) over most of western Europe, and more than 3 °C higher in the east. It was the hottest and climatologically driest summer over the 1950-2015 study period for an area stretching from the eastern Czech Republic to Ukraine. For Europe, as a whole, it is among the six hottest and driest summers since 1950. High evapotranspiration rates combined with a lack of precipitation affected soil moisture and vegetation and led to record low river flows in several major rivers, even beyond the drought-hit region. The 2015 drought developed rather rapidly over the Iberian Peninsula, France, southern Benelux and central Germany in May and reached peak intensity and spatial extent by August, affecting especially the eastern part of Europe. Over the summer period, there were four heat wave episodes, all associated with persistent blocking events. Upper-level atmospheric circulation over Europe was characterized by positive 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies flanked by a large negative anomaly to the north and west (i.e., over the central North Atlantic Ocean extending to northern Fennoscandia) and another center of positive geopotential height anomalies over Greenland and northern Canada. Simultaneously, the summer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were characterized by large negative anomalies in the central North Atlantic Ocean and large positive anomalies in the Mediterranean basin. Composite analysis shows that the western Mediterranean SST is strongly related to the occurrence of dry and hot summers over the last 66 years (especially over the eastern part of Europe). The lagged relationship between the Mediterranean SST and summer drought conditions established in this study can provide valuable skill for the prediction of drought conditions over Europe on interannual to decadal timescales. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:41","2018-01-19 23:00:41","","1397-1419","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Europe; North Atlantic Ocean; Oceanography; atmospheric circulation; climatology; drought; evapotranspiration; river flow; Climatology; Mediterranean Sea; sea surface temperature; Drought; seasonal variation; Canada; Soil moisture; Surface waters; precipitation (climatology); Mediterranean basin; Atmospheric temperature; temperature anomaly; Atmospheric circulation; Arctic; Central and Eastern Europe; air-sea interaction; Atlantic Ocean (North); Fennoscandia; Geopotential height anomalies; Greenland; heat wave; Maximum temperature; Summer sea-surface temperatures; Western Mediterranean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale column experiments were performed to quantify partitioning processes responsible for the retardation of carbon disulfide (CS2) vapor in partially saturated porous media. The results were compared with a theoretical approach taking into account the partitioning into the aqueous phase as well as adsorption to the solid matrix and to the air-water interface. The experiments were conducted in large, vertical columns (i.d. of 0.109-m) of 2-m length packed with different porous media. A slug of CS2 vapor and the conservative tracer argon was injected at the bottom of the column followed by a nitrogen chase. Different seepage velocities were applied to characterize the transport and to evaluate their impact on retardation. Concentrations of CS2 and argon were measured at the top outlet of the column using two gas chromatographs. The temporal-moment analysis for step input was employed to evaluate concentration breakthrough curves and to quantify dispersion and retardation. The experiments conducted showed a pronounced retardation of CS2 in moist porous media which increased with water saturation. The comparison with an analytical solution helped to identify the relative contributions of partitioning processes to retardation. Thus, the experiments demonstrated that migrating CS2 vapor is retarded as a result of partitioning processes. Moreover, CS2 dissolved in the bulk water is amenable to biodegradation. The first evidence of CS2 decay by biodegradation was found in the experiments. The findings contribute to the understanding of vapor-plume transport in the unsaturated zone and provide valuable experimental data for the transfer to field-like conditions. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:44","2018-01-19 23:00:44","","1381-1396","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; seepage; aquifer; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; adsorption; experimental study; Biodegradation; vadose zone; Carbon; Air; Phase interfaces; porous medium; biodegradation; tracer; interface; Seepage; Relative contribution; Porous materials; Air water interfaces; argon; Argon; Break through curve; Carbon disulfide; Conservative tracers; Gas chromatographs; Nonaqueous phase liquids; Partially saturated porous media; plume; Theoretical approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in radar hardware, data processing, numerical models, and emerging fields within urban hydrology necessitate an updated review of the state of the art in such radar rainfall data and applications. Three key areas with significant advances over the past decade have been identified: (1) temporal and spatial resolution of rainfall data required for different types of hydrological applications, (2) rainfall estimation, radar data adjustment and data quality, and (3) nowcasting of radar rainfall and real-time applications. Based on these three fields of research, the paper provides recommendations based on an updated overview of shortcomings, gains, and novel developments in relation to urban hydrological applications. The paper also reviews how the focus in urban hydrology research has shifted over the last decade to fields such as climate change impacts, resilience of urban areas to hydrological extremes, and online prediction/warning systems.

Increases in precipitation and local evaporation in the Arctic, known as the acceleration components of the hydrologic cycle, coupled with land cover changes, have resulted in significant changes in the regional surface energy budget. Quantifying spatiotemporal trends in surface energy flux partitioning is key to forecasting ecological responses to changing climate conditions in the Arctic. An extensive local evaluation of the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB)-a remote-sensing-based model using thermal infrared retrievals of land surface temperature-was performed using tower measurements collected over different tundra types in Alaska in all sky conditions over the full growing season from 2008 to 2012. Based on comparisons with flux tower observations, refinements in the original TSEB net radiation, soil heat flux and canopy transpiration parameterizations were identified for Arctic tundra. In particular, a revised method for estimating soil heat flux based on relationships with soil temperature was developed, resulting in significantly improved performance. These refinements result in mean turbulent flux errors generally less than 50 W m-2 at half-hourly time steps, similar to errors typically reported in surface energy balance modeling studies conducted in more temperate climatic regimes. The MODIS leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing product proved to be useful for estimating energy fluxes in Arctic tundra in the absence of field data on the local biomass amount. Model refinements found in this work at the local scale build toward a regional implementation of the TSEB model over Arctic tundra ecosystems, using thermal satellite remote sensing to assess response of surface fluxes to changing vegetation and climate conditions. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:49","2018-01-19 23:00:49","","1339-1358","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; hydrological cycle; satellite data; land cover; remote sensing; Ecology; Climate models; Surface measurement; spatiotemporal analysis; energy flux; Remote sensing; Budget control; Soils; Landforms; estimation method; Heat flux; MODIS; energy balance; Energy balance; snowmelt; soil temperature; Satellite remote sensing; Land surface temperature; Atmospheric temperature; climate conditions; leaf area index; permafrost; ecosystem response; Alaska; biomass; growing season; Interfacial energy; surface energy; Surface energy fluxes; Arctic; Canopy transpirations; plant community; Permafrost degradation; Sandwich structures; Surface energy balance modeling; Surface energy budget; tundra; Two-source energy balance model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latest numerical weather forecast model could provide 1&ndash;15-day quantitative precipitation forecasting products in grid format, and by coupling this product with a distributed hydrological model could produce long lead time watershed flood forecasting products. This paper studied the feasibility of coupling the Liuxihe model with the Weather Research and Forecasting quantitative precipitation forecast (WRF QPF) for large watershed flood forecasting in southern China. The QPF of WRF products has three lead times, including 24, 48 and 72 h, with the grid resolution being 20 km × 20 km. The Liuxihe model is set up with freely downloaded terrain property; the model parameters were previously optimized with rain gauge observed precipitation, and re-optimized with the WRF QPF. Results show that the WRF QPF has bias with the rain gauge precipitation, and a post-processing method is proposed to post-process the WRF QPF products, which improves the flood forecasting capability. With model parameter re-optimization, the model's performance improves also. This suggests that the model parameters be optimized with QPF, not the rain gauge precipitation. With the increasing of lead time, the accuracy of the WRF QPF decreases, as does the flood forecasting capability. Flood forecasting products produced by coupling the Liuxihe model with the WRF QPF provide a good reference for large watershed flood warning due to its long lead time and rational results. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:52","2018-01-19 23:00:52","","1279-1294","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; performance assessment; hydrological modeling; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; Flood forecasting; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; numerical model; Watersheds; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; precipitation (climatology); flood forecasting; quantitative analysis; warning system; Gages; raingauge; Rain gages; Distributed hydrological model; feasibility study; mitigation; Emergency response; Postprocessing methods; Numerical weather forecasts; Quantitative precipitation forecast; Quantitative precipitation forecasting; Weather research and forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data from both point-scale soil water content (SWC) sensors and the area-average technique of cosmic-ray neutron probes were evaluated against independent ETa estimates from a co-located eddy covariance tower. While this methodology has been successfully used for estimates of groundwater recharge, it was essential to assess the performance of other components of the water balance such as ETa. In light of recent evaluations of land surface models (LSMs), independent estimates of hydrologic state variables and fluxes are critically needed benchmarks. The results here indicate reasonable estimates of daily and annual ETa from the point sensors, but with highly varied soil hydraulic function parameterizations due to local soil texture variability. The results of multiple soil hydraulic parameterizations leading to equally good ETa estimates is consistent with the hydrological principle of equifinality. While this study focused on one particular site, the framework can be easily applied to other SWC monitoring networks across the globe. The value-added products of groundwater recharge and ETa flux from the SWC monitoring networks will provide additional and more robust benchmarks for the validation of LSM that continues to improve their forecast skill. In addition, the value-added products of groundwater recharge and ETa often have more direct impacts on societal decision-making than SWC alone. Water flux impacts human decision-making from policies on the long-term management of groundwater resources (recharge), to yield forecasts (ETa), and to optimal irrigation scheduling (ETa). Illustrating the societal benefits of SWC monitoring is critical to insure the continued operation and expansion of these public datasets. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:55","2018-01-19 23:00:55","","1263-1277","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Evapotranspiration; Nebraska; United States; evapotranspiration; water content; Parameter estimation; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical model; Economic and social effects; decision making; Optimal irrigation scheduling; Scheduling; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; vadose zone; benchmarking; maize; Zea mays; Human decision making; Ground water recharge; recharge; agricultural land; Actual evapotranspiration; monitoring system; Recharging (underground waters); eddy covariance; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Glycine max; feasibility study; Inverse problems; Eddy covariance towers; soil texture; Agricultural monitoring; Soil hydraulic functions; Soil hydraulic parameterizations; soybean","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study concerns the coupled unsaturated&ndash;saturated flow process induced by vertical, horizontal, and slant wells positioned in an unconfined aquifer. A mathematical model is established with special consideration of the coupled unsaturated&ndash;saturated flow process and the well orientation. Groundwater flow in the saturated zone is described by a three-dimensional governing equation and a linearized three-dimensional Richards' equation in the unsaturated zone. A solution in the Laplace domain is derived by the Laplace&ndash;finite-Fourier-transform and the method of separation of variables, and the semi-analytical solutions are obtained using a numerical inverse Laplace method. The solution is verified by a finite-element numerical model. It is found that the effects of the unsaturated zone on the drawdown of a pumping test exist at any angle of inclination of the pumping well, and this impact is more significant in the case of a horizontal well. The effects of the unsaturated zone on the drawdown are independent of the length of the horizontal well screen. The vertical well leads to the largest water volume drained from the unsaturated zone (W) during the early pumping time, and the effects of the well orientation on W values become insignificant at the later time. The screen length of the horizontal well does not affect W for the whole pumping period. The proposed solutions are useful for the parameter identification of pumping tests with a general well orientation (vertical, horizontal, and slant) in unconfined aquifers affected from above by the unsaturated flow process. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:00:58","2018-01-19 23:00:58","","1251-1262","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","equation; Hydrogeology; flow pattern; Groundwater flow; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical model; numerical method; Numerical methods; Water levels; groundwater flow; vadose zone; Pumps; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; unconfined aquifer; Unconfined aquifers; Horizontal wells; phreatic zone; well water; Fourier transform; Governing equations; Conventional models; drawdown; Finite element method; Finite element numerical models; Finite Fourier transform; Laplace transform; Laplace transforms; Method of separation of variables; Richards 'equation; Semi-analytical solution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first step, the AEM data are inverted to form a 3-D geophysical model. In the second step, the 3-D geophysical model is translated, using a spatially dependent petrophysical relationship, to form a 3-D hydraulic conductivity distribution. The geophysical models and the hydrological data are used to estimate spatially distributed petrophysical shape factors. The shape factors primarily work as translators between resistivity and hydraulic conductivity, but they can also compensate for structural defects in the geophysical model. The method is demonstrated for a synthetic case study with sharp transitions among various types of deposits. Besides demonstrating the methodology, we demonstrate the importance of using geophysical regularization constraints that conform well to the depositional environment. This is done by inverting the AEM data using either smoothness (smooth) constraints or minimum gradient support (sharp) constraints, where the use of sharp constraints conforms best to the environment. The dependency on AEM data quality is also tested by inverting the geophysical model using data corrupted with four different levels of background noise. Subsequently, the geophysical models are used to construct competing groundwater models for which the shape factors are calibrated. The performance of each groundwater model is tested with respect to four types of prediction that are beyond the calibration base: a pumping well's recharge area and groundwater age, respectively, are predicted by applying the same stress as for the hydrologic model calibration; and head and stream discharge are predicted for a different stress situation. As expected, in this case the predictive capability of a groundwater model is better when it is based on a sharp geophysical model instead of a smoothness constraint. This is true for predictions of recharge area, head change, and stream discharge, while we find no improvement for prediction of groundwater age. Furthermore, we show that the model prediction accuracy improves with AEM data quality for predictions of recharge area, head change, and stream discharge, while there appears to be no accuracy improvement for the prediction of groundwater age. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:01","2018-01-19 23:01:01","","1321-1337","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","prediction; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Groundwater; Geophysics; calibration; three-dimensional modeling; Predictive capabilities; data quality; hydraulic conductivity; recharge; groundwater resource; Recharging (underground waters); Hydraulic conductivity; Airborne electromagnetic; airborne survey; Conductivity distributions; Depositional environment; Efficient construction; Electric discharges; electromagnetic survey; Geophysical modeling; Magnetometers; Petrophysical relationship; Smoothness constraints","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model parametrizations are based on a comprehensive field data set, expert knowledge and process-based reasoning. Evaluation against streamflow data highlights that both models predicted the annual pattern of streamflow generation as well as the hydrographs acceptably. However, a look beyond performance measures revealed deficiencies in streamflow simulations during the summer season and during individual rainfall-runoff events as well as a mismatch between observed and simulated soil water dynamics. Some of these shortcomings can be related to our perception of the systems and to the chosen hydrological model, while others point to limitations of the representative hillslope concept itself. Nevertheless, our results confirm that representative hillslope models are a suitable tool to assess the importance of different data sources as well as to challenge our perception of the dominant hydrological processes we want to represent therein.

In order to help bridge the gap between these scales using modelling, a new dataset of daily meteorological variables was created at 1ĝ€km resolution over Great Britain for the years 1961&ndash;2012, by interpolating coarser resolution climate data and including the effects of local topography. These variables were used to calculate atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) at the same spatial and temporal resolution. Two functions that represent AED were chosen: one is a standard form of potential evapotranspiration (PET) and the other is a derived PET measure used by hydrologists that includes the effect of water intercepted by the canopy (PETI). Temporal trends in these functions were calculated, with PET found to be increasing in all regions, and at an overall rate of 0.021±0.021ĝ€mmĝ€dayĝ'1ĝ€decadeĝ'1 in Great Britain. PETI was found to be increasing at a rate of 0.019±0.020ĝ€mmĝ€dayĝ'1ĝ€decadeĝ'1 in Great Britain, but this was not statistically significant. However, there was a trend in PETI in England of 0.023±0.023ĝ€mmĝ€dayĝ'1ĝ€decadeĝ'1. The trends were found to vary by season, with spring PET increasing by 0.043±0.019ĝ€mmĝ€dayĝ'1ĝ€decadeĝ'1 (0.038±0.018ĝ€mmĝ€dayĝ'1ĝ€decadeĝ'1 when the interception correction is included) in Great Britain, while there is no statistically significant trend in other seasons. The trends were attributed analytically to trends in the climate variables; the overall positive trend was predominantly driven by rising air temperature, although rising specific humidity had a negative effect on the trend. Recasting the analysis in terms of relative humidity revealed that the overall effect is that falling relative humidity causes the PET to rise. Increasing downward short-and longwave radiation made an overall positive contribution to the PET trend, while decreasing wind speed made a negative contribution to the trend in PET. The trend in spring PET was particularly strong due to a strong decrease in relative humidity and increase in downward shortwave radiation in the spring. © Author(s) 2017.

The accompanying perforation of the subsurface for those purposes has increased the risk of short-circuiting of originally separated aquifers. This study shows how this short-circuiting negatively impacts the freshwater recovery efficiency (RE) during aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) in coastal aquifers. ASR was applied in a shallow saltwater aquifer overlying a deeper, confined saltwater aquifer, which was targeted for seasonal aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES). Although both aquifers were considered properly separated (i.e., a continuous clay layer prevented rapid groundwater flow between both aquifers), intrusion of deeper saltwater into the shallower aquifer quickly terminated the freshwater recovery. The presumable pathway was a nearby ATES borehole. This finding was supported by field measurements, hydrochemical analyses, and variable-density solute transport modeling (SEAWAT version 4; Langevin et al., 2007). The potentially rapid short-circuiting during storage and recovery can reduce the RE of ASR to null. When limited mixing with ambient groundwater is allowed, a linear RE decrease by short-circuiting with increasing distance from the ASR well within the radius of the injected ASR bubble was observed. Interception of deep short-circuiting water can mitigate the observed RE decrease, although complete compensation of the RE decrease will generally be unattainable. Brackish water upconing from the underlying aquitard towards the shallow recovery wells of the ASR system with multiple partially penetrating wells (MPPW-ASR) was observed. This <q>leakage</q> may lead to a lower recovery efficiency than based on current ASR performance estimations. © Author(s) 2017.

To characterize land use intensity, we analyzed spatial and temporal changes in livestock density and land disturbance (i.e., bare soil resulting from vegetation loss by either grazing or forest harvesting) at the catchment scale, as well as fertilizer inputs at the national scale. Using simple multivariate statistical analyses across the 77 catchments, we found that median visual water clarity was best predicted inversely by areal coverage of intensively managed pastures. The primary predictor for all four nutrient variables (TN, NO/, TP, DRP), however, was cattle density, with plantation forest coverage as the secondary predictor variable. While land disturbance was not itself a strong predictor of water quality, it did help explain outliers of land use-water quality relationships. From 1990 to 2014, visual clarity significantly improved in 35 out of 77 (34g77) catchments, which we attribute mainly to increased dairy cattle exclusion from rivers (despite dairy expansion) and the considerable decrease in sheep numbers across the NZ landscape, from 58 million sheep in 1990 to 31 million in 2012. Nutrient concentrations increased in many of NZ's rivers with dissolved oxidized nitrogen significantly increasing in 27g77 catchments, which we largely attribute to increased cattle density and legacy nutrients that have built up on intensively managed grasslands and plantation forests since the 1950s and are slowly leaking to the rivers. Despite recent improvements in water quality for some NZ rivers, these legacy nutrients and continued agricultural intensification are expected to pose broad-scale environmental problems for decades to come.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:12","2018-01-19 23:01:12","","1149-1171","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Vegetation; Water quality; Water resources; catchment; New Zealand; water quality; Rivers; Land use; Agriculture; Environmental problems; environmental impact; Environmental impact; Catchments; Forestry; river system; Multivariant analysis; river water; human activity; Fertilizers; Complex networks; Nutrients; land use; Spatial and temporal changes; River water quality; Predictor variables; Nutrient concentrations; nutrient enrichment; agricultural intensification; Agricultural intensification; Bos; Large river system; livestock farming; Multivariate statistical analysis; Ovis aries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially challenging in forested montane watersheds where the combined effects of terrain, climate, and land cover affect seasonal snowpack. We present a coupled modeling approach used to objectively identify representative snow-monitoring locations in a forested watershed in the western Oregon Cascades mountain range. We used a binary regression tree (BRT) non-parametric statistical model to classify peak snow water equivalent (SWE) based on physiographic landscape characteristics in an average snow year, an above-average snow year, and a below-average snow year. Training data for the BRT classification were derived using spatially distributed estimates of SWE from a validated physically based model of snow evolution. The optimal BRT model showed that elevation and land cover type were the most significant drivers of spatial variability in peak SWE across the watershed (R2 Combining double low line 0.93, p value &amp;lt; 0.01). Geospatial elevation and land cover data were used to map the BRT-derived snow classes across the watershed. Specific snow-monitoring sites were selected randomly within the dominant BRT-derived snow classes to capture the range of spatial variability in snowpack conditions in the McKenzie River basin. The Forest Elevational Snow Transect (ForEST) is a result of this coupled modeling approach and represents combinations of forested and open land cover types at low, mid-, and high elevations. After 5 years of snowpack monitoring, the ForEST network provides a valuable and detailed dataset of snow accumulation, snow ablation, and snowpack energy balance in forested and open sites from the rain&amp;ndash;snow transition zone to the upper seasonal snow zone in the western Oregon Cascades. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:15","2018-01-19 23:01:15","","1137-1147","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; United States; snowpack; Statistical modeling; regression analysis; watershed; Watersheds; Forestry; spatial variation; Landforms; Classification (of information); Oregon; monitoring system; Binary trees; peak flow; ablation; Ablation; Cascade Range; snow accumulation; Snow water equivalent; mountain region; ground-based measurement; Physically based modeling; Forested watersheds; Ground-based stations; Landscape characteristic; McKenzie River; Monitoring locations; montane forest; Satellite ground stations; Snowpack accumulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most important active agent in catchments is the ecosystem. It manipulates and partitions moisture in a way that supports the essential functions of survival and productivity: infiltration of water, retention of moisture, mobilization and retention of nutrients, and drainage. Ecosystems do this in the most efficient way, establishing a continuous, ever-evolving feedback loop with the landscape and climatic drivers. In brief, hydrological systems are alive and have a strong capacity to adjust themselves to prevailing and changing environmental conditions. Although most models take Newtonian theory at heart, as best they can, what they generally miss is Darwinian theory on how an ecosystem evolves and adjusts its environment to maintain crucial hydrological functions. In addition, catchments, such as many other natural systems, do not only evolve over time, but develop features of spatial organization, including surface or sub-surface drainage patterns, as a by-product of this evolution. Models that fail to account for patterns and the associated feedbacks miss a critical element of how systems at the interface of atmosphere, biosphere and pedosphere function. In contrast to what is widely believed, relatively simple, semi-distributed conceptual models have the potential to accommodate organizational features and their temporal evolution in an efficient way, a reason for that being that because their parameters (and their evolution over time) are effective at the modelling scale, and thus integrate natural heterogeneity within the system, they may be directly inferred from observations at the same scale, reducing the need for calibration and related problems. In particular, the emergence of new and more detailed observation systems from space will lead towards a more robust understanding of spatial organization and its evolution. This will further permit the development of relatively simple time-dynamic functional relationships that can meaningfully represent spatial patterns and their evolution over time, even in poorly gauged environments. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:18","2018-01-19 23:01:18","","1107-1116","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; moisture; Ecology; Environmental conditions; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; Ecosystems; infiltration; conceptual framework; ecosystem function; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modelling; drainage; Moisture; Observation systems; Hydrological system; Spatial organization; mobilization; water retention; Biology; Hydrological functions; Essential characteristic; Functional relationship; nutrient availability; survival; temporal evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous work has demonstrated that groundwater&ndash;surface water interactions will shift Budyko relationships. While modified Budyko approaches have been proposed to account for storage changes, given the limited ability to quantify groundwater fluxes and storage across spatial scales, additional research is needed to understand the implications of these approximations. This study evaluates the impact of storage changes on Budyko relationships given three common approaches to estimating evapotranspiration fractions: (1) determining evapotranspiration from observations, (2) calculating evapotranspiration from precipitation and surface water outflow, and (3) adjusting precipitation to account for storage changes. We show conceptually that groundwater storage changes will shift the Budyko relationship differently depending on the way evapotranspiration is estimated. A 1-year transient simulation is used to mimic all three approaches within a numerical framework in which groundwater&ndash;surface water exchanges are prevalent and can be fully quantified. The model domain spans the majority of the continental US and encompasses 25ĝ€000 nested watersheds ranging in size from 100ĝ€km2 to over 3ĝ€000ĝ€000ĝ€km2. Model results illustrate that storage changes can generate different spatial patterns in Budyko relationships depending on the approach used. This shows the potential for systematic bias when comparing studies that use different approaches to estimating evapotranspiration. Comparisons between watersheds are also relevant for studies that seek to characterize variability in the Budyko space using other watershed characteristics. Our results demonstrate that within large complex domains the correlation between storage changes and other relevant watershed properties, such as aridity, makes it difficult to easily isolate storage changes as an independent predictor of behavior. However, we suggest that, using the conceptual models presented here, comparative studies could still easily evaluate a range of spatially heterogeneous storage changes by perturbing individual points to better incorporate uncertain storage changes into analysis. © Author(s) 2017.

Between these two campaigns, the sea surface level decreased by 3.2m. The periods of the fundamental modes were identified as 36 and 14h, respectively. In both years, either second or third vertical modes were found. In general, the vertical modes in 2013 were higher because of the broad and strong pycnocline. For both years, it was found that the deep quasi-homogeneous mixed upper layer could sustain internal waves under mild wind conditions. The observed first and second vertical modes in 2006 are the first and second horizontal modes and the second and third vertical modes in 2013 are the second and third horizontal modes.

Such qualities complicate the inclusion of beaver ponds in local and regional water balances, and in hydrological models, as reliable estimates of surface-water storage are difficult to acquire without time- and labour-intensive topographic surveys. A simpler approach to overcome this challenge is needed, given the abundance of the beaver ponds in North America, Eurasia, and southern South America. We investigated whether simple morphometric characteristics derived from readily available aerial imagery or quickly measured field attributes of beaver ponds can be used to approximate surface-water storage among the range of environmental settings in which beaver ponds are found. Studied were a total of 40 beaver ponds from four different sites in North and South America. The simplified volume-area-depth (V-A-h) approach, originally developed for prairie potholes, was tested. With only two measurements of pond depth and corresponding surface area, this method estimated surface-water storage in beaver ponds within 5 % on average. Beaver pond morphometry was characterized by a median basin coefficient of 0.91, and dam length and pond surface area were strongly correlated with beaver pond storage capacity, regardless of geographic setting. These attributes provide a means for coarsely estimating surface-water storage capacity in beaver ponds. Overall, this research demonstrates that reliable estimates of surface-water storage in beaver ponds only requires simple measurements derived from aerial imagery and/or brief visits to the field. Future research efforts should be directed at incorporating these simple methods into both broader beaver-related tools and catchment-scale hydrological models. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:26","2018-01-19 23:01:26","","1039-1050","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","catchment; surface water; Hydrological models; topography; Estimation; North America; hydrological modeling; Catchments; Hydrology; water storage; morphometry; Lakes; Surface waters; Aerial photography; water budget; Reliable estimates; surface area; South America; pond; Eurasia; Geographic setting; Morphometric characteristics; Ponds; Regional water balance; Southern south america; Topographic surveys; volume change; Water storage capacity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider the case of modeling of two-fluid-phase flow in porous media, and we focus on issues of scale as they relate to various measures of pressure, capillary pressure, and state equations needed to produce solvable models. We apply TCAT to perform physics-based data assimilation to understand how the internal behavior influences the macroscale state of two-fluid porous medium systems. A microfluidic experimental method and a lattice Boltzmann simulation method are used to examine a key deficiency associated with standard approaches. In a hydrologic process such as evaporation, the water content will ultimately be reduced below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation determined from experiments. This is problematic since the derived closure relationships cannot predict the associated capillary pressures for these states. We demonstrate that the irreducible wetting-phase saturation is an artifact of the experimental design, caused by the fact that the boundary pressure difference does not approximate the true capillary pressure. Using averaging methods, we compute the true capillary pressure for fluid configurations at and below the irreducible wetting-phase saturation. Results of our analysis include a state function for the capillary pressure expressed as a function of fluid saturation and interfacial area. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:28","2018-01-19 23:01:28","","1063-1076","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evaporation; simulation; data assimilation; water content; experimental design; porous medium; hydrological regime; Equations of state; Experimental methods; saturation; Porous materials; Boundary pressure; Capillarity; Capillary flow; capillary pressure; Capillary tubes; Fluid configuration; Hydrologic process; Interfacial areas; Lattice Boltzmann simulations; Mechanical permeability; Porous medium systems; Thermodynamically constrained averaging theories; thermodynamics; wetting; Wetting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because irrigation increases soil moisture, feedback on the surface energy balance, rainfall recycling, and atmospheric dynamics is not represented and may lead to reduced model skill. In this work, we describe four plausible and relatively simple irrigation routines that can be coupled to the next generation of hyper-resolution LSMs operating at scales of 1 km or less. The irrigation output from the four routines (crop model, precipitation delayed, evapotranspiration replacement, and vadose zone model) is compared against a historical field-scale irrigation database (2008-2014) from a 35 km2 study area under maize production and center pivot irrigation in western Nebraska (USA). We find that the most yield-conservative irrigation routine (crop model) produces seasonal totals of irrigation that compare well against the observed irrigation amounts across a range of wet and dry years but with a low bias of 80 mm yrg-1. The most aggressive irrigation saving routine (vadose zone model) indicates a potential irrigation savings of 120 mm yrg-1 and yield losses of less than 3 % against the crop model benchmark and historical averages. The results of the various irrigation routines and associated yield penalties will be valuable for future consideration by local water managers to be informed about the potential value of irrigation saving technologies and irrigation practices. Moreover, the routines offer the hyper-resolution LSM community a range of irrigation routines to better constrain irrigation decision-making at critical temporal (daily) and spatial scales (&lt;-1 km). © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:31","2018-01-19 23:01:31","","1051-1062","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Nebraska; United States; database; Atmospheric dynamics; land surface; water management; hydrological modeling; Surface measurement; Groundwater; field method; decision making; crop production; Crops; Irrigation; irrigation system; Soil moisture; vadose zone; Land surface modeling; maize; Zea mays; spatial resolution; Land surface models; Managers; Center-pivot irrigation; Irrigation patterns; Irrigation practices; Operational forecasts; Vadose zone modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rainfall data collected from a cluster of eight paired rain gauges in a 400 × 200m urban catchment are used in combination with spatial stochastic simulation to obtain optimal predictions of the spatially averaged rainfall intensity at any point in time within the urban catchment. The uncertainty in the prediction of catchment average rainfall intensity is obtained for multiple combinations of intensity ranges and temporal averaging intervals. The two main challenges addressed in this study are scarcity of rainfall measurement locations and non-normality of rainfall data, both of which need to be considered when adopting a geostatistical approach. Scarcity of measurement points is dealt with by pooling sample variograms of repeated rainfall measurements with similar characteristics. Normality of rainfall data is achieved through the use of normal score transformation. Geostatistical models in the form of variograms are derived for transformed rainfall intensity. Next spatial stochastic simulation which is robust to nonlinear data transformation is applied to produce realisations of rainfall fields. These realisations in transformed space are first back-transformed and next spatially aggregated to derive a random sample of the spatially averaged rainfall intensity. Results show that the prediction uncertainty comes mainly from two sources: spatial variability of rainfall and measurement error. At smaller temporal averaging intervals both these effects are high, resulting in a relatively high uncertainty in prediction. With longer temporal averaging intervals the uncertainty becomes lower due to stronger spatial correlation of rainfall data and relatively smaller measurement error. Results also show that the measurement error increases with decreasing rainfall intensity resulting in a higher uncertainty at lower intensities. Results from this study can be used for uncertainty analyses of hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling of similar-sized urban catchments as it provides information on uncertainty associated with rainfall estimation, which is arguably the most important input in these models. This will help to better interpret model results and avoid false calibration and force-fitting of model parameters. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:34","2018-01-19 23:01:34","","1077-1091","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; catchment; rainfall; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; numerical model; Metadata; hydrodynamics; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Errors; Spatial correlations; Prediction uncertainty; upscaling; Mathematical transformations; Gages; raingauge; precipitation intensity; Rain gages; Rainfall estimations; Geostatistical approach; Geostatistical models; Hydrodynamic modelling; Measurement errors; Rainfall measurements; Spatial stochastic simulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for diagnosing ET patterns over heterogeneous landscapes; however, limitations on the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data, combined with the effects of cloud contamination, constrain the amount of detail that a single satellite can provide. In this study, we describe an application of a multi-sensor ET data fusion system over a mixed forested/agricultural landscape in North Carolina, USA, during the growing season of 2013. The fusion system ingests ET estimates from the Two-Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) applied to thermal infrared remote sensing retrievals of land surface temperature from multiple satellite platforms: hourly geostationary satellite data at 4 km resolution, daily 1 km imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and biweekly Landsat thermal data sharpened to 30 m. These multiple ET data streams are combined using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to estimate daily ET at 30m resolution to investigate seasonal water use behavior at the level of individual forest stands and land cover patches. A new method, also exploiting the STARFM algorithm, is used to fill gaps in the Landsat ET retrievals due to cloud cover and/or the scan-line corrector (SLC) failure on Landsat 7. The retrieved daily ET time series agree well with observations at two AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux tower sites in a managed pine plantation within the modeling domain: US-NC2 located in a mid-rotation (20-year-old) loblolly pine stand and USNC3 located in a recently clear-cut and replanted field site. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) for NC2 and NC3 were 0.99 and 1.02mmday-1, respectively, with mean absolute errors of approximately 29% at the daily time step, 12% at the monthly time step and 0.7% over the full study period at the two flux tower sites. Analyses of water use patterns over the plantation indicate increasing seasonal ET with stand age for young to mid-rotation stands up to 20 years, but little dependence on age for older stands. An accounting of consumptive water use by major land cover classes representative of the modeling domain is presented, as well as relative partitioning of ET between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T ) components obtained with the TSEB.

The traditional interpolation methods or satellite-based remote sensing products are known to have limitations in capturing the spatial variability of precipitation in mountainous areas. In this study, we develop a fusion framework to improve the annual precipitation estimation in mountainous areas by jointly utilizing the satellite-based precipitation, gauge measured precipitation, and vegetation index. The development consists of vegetation data merging, vegetation response establishment, and precipitation remapping. The framework is then applied to the mountainous areas of the Nu River basin for precipitation estimation. The results demonstrate the reliability of the framework in reproducing the high-resolution precipitation regime and capturing its high spatial variability in the Nu River basin. In addition, the framework can significantly reduce the errors in precipitation estimates as compared with the inverse distance weighted (IDW) method and the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation product. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:39","2018-01-19 23:01:39","","999-1015","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Vegetation; remote sensing; Rivers; mapping method; Watersheds; Remote sensing; Precipitation (meteorology); spatial variation; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); raingauge; annual variation; Rain gages; Precipitation regimes; vegetation dynamics; Precipitation products; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Annual precipitation; Inverse problems; mountain region; Vegetation response; Inverse distance weighted; Interpolation method; Precipitation estimation; Salween River; vegetation index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Land-use and land-cover changes such as these may have altered the timing and quantity of water yield (Q). We examined 80 years of streamflow and vegetation data in an experimental watershed that underwent forest-grass-forest conversion (i.e., old-field succession treatment). We hypothesized that changes in forest species composition and water use would largely explain long-term changes in Q. Aboveground biomass was comparable among watersheds before the treatment (208.3 Mg ha-1), and again after 45 years of forest regeneration (217.9 Mg ha-1). However, management practices in the treatment watershed altered resulting species composition compared to the reference watershed. Evapotranspiration (ET) and Q in the treatment watershed recovered to pretreatment levels after 9 years of abandonment, then Q became less (averaging 5.4 % less) and ET more (averaging 4.5 % more) than expected after the 10th year up to the present day. We demonstrate that the decline in Q and corresponding increase in ET could be explained by the shift in major forest species from predominantly Quercus and Carya before treatment to predominantly Liriodendron and Acer through old-field succession. The annual change in Q can be attributed to changes in seasonal Q. The greatest management effect on monthly Q occurred during the wettest (i.e., above median Q) growing-season months, when Q was significantly lower than expected. In the dormant season, monthly Q was higher than expected during the wettest months. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:42","2018-01-19 23:01:42","","981-997","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evapotranspiration; land cover; water management; Land use; Agriculture; Management practices; Watersheds; Land use and land cover change; Water supply; Forestry; water use; land use change; forest ecosystem; quantitative analysis; water budget; Reforestation; grassland; Above ground biomass; Appalachians; abandoned land; Acer; Carya; Experimental watersheds; Forest regeneration; Forest transition; Liriodendron; Quercus; Southern appalachians; Species composition; succession; transition zone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inasmuch as an RCM grid box represents a spatial average, the effects of areal averaging of rainfall data on characteristics of events are investigated using the observed data. Rainfall events from the RCM simulations are then compared to those from the at-site and area-average observations. Simulated number of heavy events and seasonal total precipitation due to heavy events are on average represented relatively well despite the higher spatial variation compared to observations. RCM-simulated event depths are comparable to the area-average observations, while event durations are overestimated and other characteristics related to rainfall intensity are significantly underestimated. The differences between RCM-simulated and at-site observed rainfall event characteristics are in general dominated by the biases of the climate models rather than the areal-averaging effect. Most of the rainfall event characteristics in the majority of the RCM simulations show a similar altitude-dependence pattern as in the observed data. The number of heavy events and seasonal total precipitation due to heavy events increase with altitude, and this dependence is captured better by the RCM simulations with higher spatial resolution. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:48","2018-01-19 23:01:48","","963-980","","2","21","","Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Spatial resolution; rainfall; Czech Republic; climate modeling; regional climate; Climate models; spatial variation; extreme event; precipitation assessment; Rainfall intensity; Spatial variations; Total precipitation; Averaging effect; Regional climate model simulation; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Simulated events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, methods to incorporate these observations into mathematical water models have also been developed. Besides, in recent years, the continued technological advances, in combination with the growing inclusion of citizens in participatory processes related to water resources management, have encouraged the increase of citizen science projects around the globe. In turn, this has stimulated the spread of low-cost sensors to allow citizens to participate in the collection of hydrological data in a more distributed way than the classic static physical sensors do. However, two main disadvantages of such crowdsourced data are the irregular availability and variable accuracy from sensor to sensor, which makes them challenging to use in hydrological modelling. This study aims to demonstrate that streamflow data, derived from crowdsourced water level observations, can improve flood prediction if integrated in hydrological models. Two different hydrological models, applied to four case studies, are considered. Realistic (albeit synthetic) time series are used to represent crowdsourced data in all case studies. In this study, it is found that the data accuracies have much more influence on the model results than the irregular frequencies of data availability at which the streamflow data are assimilated. This study demonstrates that data collected by citizens, characterized by being asynchronous and inaccurate, can still complement traditional networks formed by few accurate, static sensors and improve the accuracy of flood forecasts. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:51","2018-01-19 23:01:51","","839-861","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; Water resources management; streamflow; Hydrological models; data assimilation; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Forecasting; water resource; numerical model; participatory approach; accuracy assessment; sensor; Hydrology; Water levels; resource management; Hydrological modelling; flood forecasting; flood; Stream flow; Technological advances; Hydrological variables; Hydrological data; Monitoring stations; Participatory process","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Precipitation was heaviest in the region broadly encompassing the city of Baton Rouge, with a 3-day maximum found at a station in Livingston, LA (east of Baton Rouge), from 12 to 14 August 2016 (648.3ĝ€mm, 25.5ĝ€inches). The intense precipitation was followed by inland flash flooding and river flooding and in subsequent days produced additional backwater flooding. On 16 August, Louisiana officials reported that 30ĝ€000 people had been rescued, nearly 10ĝ€600 people had slept in shelters on the night of 14 August and at least 60ĝ€600 homes had been impacted to varying degrees. As of 17 August, the floods were reported to have killed at least 13 people. As the disaster was unfolding, the Red Cross called the flooding the worst natural disaster in the US since Super Storm Sandy made landfall in New Jersey on 24 October 2012. Before the floodwaters had receded, the media began questioning whether this extreme event was caused by anthropogenic climate change. To provide the necessary analysis to understand the potential role of anthropogenic climate change, a rapid attribution analysis was launched in real time using the best readily available observational data and high-resolution global climate model simulations. <br><br> The objective of this study is to show the possibility of performing rapid attribution studies when both observational and model data and analysis methods are readily available upon the start. It is the authors' aspiration that the results be used to guide further studies of the devastating precipitation and flooding event. Here, we present a first estimate of how anthropogenic climate change has affected the likelihood of a comparable extreme precipitation event in the central US Gulf Coast. While the flooding event of interest triggering this study occurred in south Louisiana, for the purposes of our analysis, we have defined an extreme precipitation event by taking the spatial maximum of annual 3-day inland maximum precipitation over the region of 29-31°ĝ€N, 85-95°ĝ€W, which we refer to as the central US Gulf Coast. Using observational data, we find that the observed local return time of the 12-14 August precipitation event in 2016 is about 550 years (95ĝ€% confidence interval (CI): 450-1450). The probability for an event like this to happen anywhere in the region is presently 1 in 30 years (CI 11-110). We estimate that these probabilities and the intensity of extreme precipitation events of this return time have increased since 1900. A central US Gulf Coast extreme precipitation event has effectively become more likely in 2016 than it was in 1900. The global climate models tell a similar story; in the most accurate analyses, the regional probability of 3-day extreme precipitation increases by more than a factor of 1.4 due to anthropogenic climate change. The magnitude of the shift in probabilities is greater in the 25ĝ€km (higher-resolution) climate model than in the 50ĝ€km model. The evidence for a relation to El Niño half a year earlier is equivocal, with some analyses showing a positive connection and others none.","2017","2018-01-19 23:01:53","2018-01-19 23:01:53","","897-921","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Disasters; Extreme precipitation; United States; Global climate model; climate change; probability; Floods; Climate models; natural disaster; Precipitation (meteorology); extreme event; real time; precipitation assessment; flood; Anthropogenic climate changes; confidence interval; Precipitation events; precipitable water; Gulf Coast [United States]; Probability; Extreme precipitation events; design flood; Louisiana; Baton Rouge; Global climate model simulations; Intense precipitation; Livingston Parish; low pressure system; Low pressure systems; New Jersey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In one approach, we use GLEAM to constrain the evapotranspiration estimates generated by the model, thereby modifying daily water balance and improving model performance. In an alternative approach, we instead change the structure of the model to improve its ability to simulate actual evapotranspiration (as estimated by GLEAM). Finally, we test whether the GLEAM product is able to further improve the performance of the structurally modified model.

This heterogeneity is even more evident in semiarid regions, where the high variability of the climate produces various accumulation melting cycles throughout the year and a large spatial heterogeneity of the snow cover. This variability in a watershed can often be represented by snow accumulation-depletion curves (ADCs). In this study, terrestrial photography (TP) of a cell-sized area (30ĝ€ × ĝ€30ĝ€m) was used to define local snow ADCs at a Mediterranean site. Snow-cover fraction (SCF) and snow-depth (<i>h</i>) values obtained with this technique constituted the two datasets used to define ADCs. A flexible sigmoid function was selected to parameterize snow behaviour on this subgrid scale. It was then fitted to meet five different snow patterns in the control area: one for the accumulation phase and four for the melting phase in a cycle within the snow season. Each pattern was successfully associated with the snow conditions and previous evolution. The resulting ADCs were associated to certain physical features of the snow, which were used to incorporate them in the point snow model formulated by Herrero et al. (2009) by means of a decision tree. The final performance of this model was tested against field observations recorded over four hydrological years (2009-2013). The calibration and validation of this ADC snow model was found to have a high level of accuracy, with global RMSE values of 105.8ĝ€mm for the average snow depth and 0.21ĝ€m2ĝ€mĝ'2 for the snow-cover fraction in the control area.

Since we apply a common atmospheric forcing data set to all hydrological models considered, we conclude that those discrepancies are not entirely related to uncertainties in meteorologic input, but instead to the model structure and parametrization, and in particular to the representation of individual storage components with different spatial characteristics in each of the models. TWS as monitored by the GRACE mission is therefore a valuable validation data set for global numerical simulations of the terrestrial water storage since it is sensitive to very different model physics in individual basins, which offers helpful insight to modellers for the future improvement of large-scale numerical models of the global terrestrial water cycle. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:05","2018-01-19 23:02:05","","821-837","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","basin; discharge; hydrological cycle; satellite data; GRACE; Hydrological models; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Climate models; numerical model; accuracy assessment; water storage; Digital storage; hydrometeorology; satellite mission; Geodetic satellites; Terrestrial water storage; Numerical models; Gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites; atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric structure; Future improvements; Global numerical simulations; Global water cycle; Spatial characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The anticipated climate and socio-economic changes may further increase water stress. Many studies have investigated the changes in renewable water resources under various climate change scenarios, but few have considered the joint pressure from both climate change and socio-economic development. In this study, we assess water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways with emphasis on the impact of water scarcity on food production. The water demands in the 21st century are estimated based on the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and renewable water supply is estimated using the climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The assessment predicts that the renewable water resources would decrease slightly then increase. The domestic and industrial water withdrawals are projected to increase in the next a few decades and then remain at the high level or decrease slightly during the 21st century. The increase in water withdrawals will put the middle and lower reaches in a condition of severe water scarcity beginning in the next a few decades. If 40ĝ€% of the renewable water resources were used to sustain ecosystems, a portion of irrigated land would have to be converted to rain-fed agriculture, which would lead to a 2-11ĝ€% reduction in food production.

Based on state-of-the-art data of the hydrological cycle we derive a global average residence time of 8.9 ± 0.4 days (uncertainty given as 1 standard deviation). We use two different atmospheric moisture tracking models (WAM-2layers and 3D-T) to obtain atmospheric residence time characteristics in time and space. The tracking models estimate the global average residence time to be around 8.5 days based on ERA-Interim data. We conclude that the statement of a recent study that the global average residence time of water in the atmosphere is 4-5 days, is not correct. We derive spatial maps of residence time, attributed to evaporation and precipitation, and age of atmospheric water, showing that there are different ways of looking at temporal characteristics of atmospheric water. Longer evaporation residence times often indicate larger distances towards areas of high precipitation. From our analysis we find that the residence time over the ocean is about 2 days less than over land. It can be seen that in winter, the age of atmospheric moisture tends to be much lower than in summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, due to the contrast in ocean-to-land temperature and associated evaporation rates, the age of atmospheric moisture increases following atmospheric moisture flow inland in winter, and decreases in summer. Looking at the probability density functions of atmospheric residence time for precipitation and evaporation, we find long-tailed distributions with the median around 5 days. Overall, our research confirms the 8&ndash;10-day traditional estimate for the global mean residence time of atmospheric water, and our research contributes to a more complete view of the characteristics of the turnover of water in the atmosphere in time and space. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:10","2018-01-19 23:02:10","","779-790","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evaporation; hydrological cycle; spatiotemporal analysis; Probability distributions; tracking; probability density function; Probability density function; Moisture; precipitation intensity; Hydrological cycles; Evaporation; residence time; Northern Hemispheres; Mean residence time; atmospheric moisture; Atmospheric moisture; Atmospheric residence time; Average residence time; Long-tailed distributions; Residence time distribution; temperature effect; Temporal characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially valid for the case study of this work, the Brahmaputra Basin in South Asia. Commonly, satellite altimeters are used in various ways to provide information about such river basins. Most missions provide virtual station time series of water levels at locations where their repeat orbits cross rivers. CryoSat-2 is equipped with a new type of altimeter, providing estimates of the actual ground location seen in the reflected signal. It also uses a drifting orbit, challenging conventional ways of processing altimetry data to river water levels and their incorporation in hydrologic&ndash;hydrodynamic models. However, CryoSat-2 altimetry data provides an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution. This paper suggests a procedure to (i) filter CryoSat-2 observations over rivers to extract water-level profiles along the river, and (ii) use this information in combination with a hydrologic&ndash;hydrodynamic model to fit the simulated water levels with an accuracy that cannot be reached using information from globally available digital elevation models (DEMs) such as from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) only. The filtering was done based on dynamic river masks extracted from Landsat imagery, providing spatial and temporal resolutions high enough to map the braided river channels and their dynamic morphology. This allowed extraction of river water levels over previously unmonitored narrow stretches of the river. In the Assam Valley section of the Brahmaputra River, CryoSat-2 data and Envisat virtual station data were combined to calibrate cross sections in a 1-D hydrodynamic model of the river. The hydrologic&ndash;hydrodynamic model setup and calibration are almost exclusively based on openly available remote sensing data and other global data sources, ensuring transferability of the developed methods. They provide an opportunity to achieve forecasts of both discharge and water levels in a poorly gauged river system. © Author(s) 2017.

In order to design and manage cities to be able to deal with the growing number of extreme rainfall events, rainfall data are required at higher temporal and spatial resolutions than those needed for rural catchments. However, the density of operational rainfall monitoring networks managed by local or national authorities is typically low in urban areas. A growing number of automatic personal weather stations (PWSs) link rainfall measurements to online platforms. Here, we examine the potential of such crowdsourced datasets for obtaining the desired resolution and quality of rainfall measurements for the capital of the Netherlands. Data from 63 stations in Amsterdam (∼75 km2) that measure rainfall over at least 4 months in a 17-month period are evaluated. In addition, a detailed assessment is made of three Netatmo stations, the largest contributor to this dataset, in an experimental setup. The sensor performance in the experimental setup and the density of the PWS network are promising. However, features in the online platforms, like rounding and thresholds, cause changes from the original time series, resulting in considerable errors in the datasets obtained. These errors are especially large during low-intensity rainfall, although they can be reduced by accumulating rainfall over longer intervals. Accumulation improves the correlation coefficient with gauge-adjusted radar data from 0.48 at 5 min intervals to 0.60 at hourly intervals. Spatial rainfall correlation functions derived from PWS data show much more small-scale variability than those based on gauge-adjusted radar data and those found in similar research using dedicated rain gauge networks. This can largely be attributed to the noise in the PWS data resulting from both the measurement setup and the processes occurring in the data transfer to the online PWS platform. A double mass comparison with gauge-adjusted radar data shows that the median of the stations resembles the rainfall reference better than the real-time (unadjusted) radar product. Averaging nearby raw PWS measurements further improves the match with gauge-adjusted radar data in that area. These results confirm that the growing number of internet-connected PWSs could successfully be used for urban rainfall monitoring. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:16","2018-01-19 23:02:16","","765-777","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; rainfall; radar; Netherlands; environmental monitoring; sensor; Catchments; urban area; Precipitation (meteorology); experimental design; precipitation assessment; Gages; raingauge; crowdsourcing; precipitation intensity; Rain gages; Radar measurement; Radar; Radar stations; Correlation coefficient; Temporal and spatial; Automatic weather stations; Weather information services; weather station; Rainfall measurements; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Data transfer; Low-intensity rainfall; North Holland; Rainfall monitoring network; Small scale variability; Spatial rainfall correlations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To cope with this challenge, two efforts could be made; one is to improve the model's computation efficiency in a large watershed, the other is implementing the model on a high-performance supercomputer. This study sets up a physically based distributed hydrological model for flood forecasting of the Liujiang River basin in south China. Terrain data digital elevation model (DEM), soil and land use are downloaded from the website freely, and the model structure with a high resolution of 200m × 200m grid cell is set up. The initial model parameters are derived from the terrain property data, and then optimized by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm; the model is used to simulate 29 observed flood events. It has been found that by dividing the river channels into virtual channel sections and assuming the cross section shapes as trapezoid, the Liuxihe model largely increases computation efficiency while keeping good model performance, thus making it applicable in larger watersheds. This study also finds that parameter uncertainty exists for physically deriving model parameters, and parameter optimization could reduce this uncertainty, and is highly recommended. Computation time needed for running a distributed hydrological model increases exponentially at a power of 2, not linearly with the increasing of model spatial resolution, and the 200m × 200m model resolution is proposed for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood with the Liuxihe model in this study. To keep the model with an acceptable performance, minimum model spatial resolution is needed. The suggested threshold model spatial resolution for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood is a 500m × 500m grid cell, but the model spatial resolution with a 200m × 200m grid cell is recommended in this study to keep the model at a better performance. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:20","2018-01-19 23:02:20","","735-749","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; algorithm; optimization; performance assessment; Rivers; hydrological modeling; computer simulation; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Land use; watershed; Watersheds; Hydrology; Computational efficiency; Efficiency; terrain; digital elevation model; flood forecasting; Computation efficiency; Digital elevation model; Surveying; Supercomputers; spatial resolution; Image resolution; land use; Distributed hydrological model; river channel; Parameter uncertainty; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Parameter optimization; Acceptable performance; Cross section shape; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Liu River; Particle swarm optimization algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An original methodology is developed to identify the spatial statistical parameters (mean, variance, correlation range) of the hydraulic conductivity in a three-dimensional (3-D) setting by using geological and geophysical data. More specifically, a large number of inexpensive vertical electric soundings are integrated with a facies model developed from borehole lithologic data to simulate the log10(K) continuous distributions in multiple-zone heterogeneous alluvial megafans. The Chaobai River alluvial fan in the Beijing Plain, China, is used as an example to test the proposed approach. Due to the non-stationary property of the K distribution in the alluvial fan, a multiple-zone parameterization approach is applied to analyze the conductivity statistical properties of different hydrofacies in the various zones. The composite variance in each zone is computed to describe the evolution of the conductivity along the flow direction. Consistently with the scales of the sedimentary transport energy, the results show that conductivity variances of fine sand, medium-coarse sand, and gravel decrease from the upper (zone 1) to the lower (zone 3) portion along the flow direction. In zone 1, sediments were moved by higher-energy flooding, which induces poor sorting and larger conductivity variances. The composite variance confirms this feature with statistically different facies from zone 1 to zone 3. The results of this study provide insights to improve our understanding on conductivity heterogeneity and a method for characterizing the spatial distribution of K in alluvial fans. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:25","2018-01-19 23:02:25","","721-733","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Statistical methods; flow pattern; hydrological modeling; parameterization; heterogeneity; sediment transport; Geophysics; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; three-dimensional modeling; Landforms; data acquisition; hydraulic conductivity; Hydraulic properties; North China Plain; Statistical properties; Hydraulic conductivity; alluvial fan; permeability; Threedimensional (3-d); Continuous distribution; Beijing [China]; Beijing Plain; Chaobai River; Depositional process; depositional sequence; facies; Non-stationary properties; Permeability distribution; Statistical parameters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the effects of climate change on glaciers and snow cover will have increasingly significant consequences for runoff. Hydrological modeling has become an indispensable research approach to water resources management in large glacierized river basins, but there is a lack of focus in the modeling of glacial discharge. This paper reviews the status of hydrological modeling in glacierized catchments of central Asia, discussing the limitations of the available models and extrapolating these to future challenges and directions. After reviewing recent efforts, we conclude that the main sources of uncertainty in assessing the regional hydrological impacts of climate change are the unreliable and incomplete data sets and the lack of understanding of the hydrological regimes of glacierized catchments of central Asia. Runoff trends indicate a complex response to changes in climate. For future variation of water resources, it is essential to quantify the responses of hydrologic processes to both climate change and shrinking glaciers in glacierized catchments, and scientific focus should be on reducing uncertainties linked to these processes. © Author(s) 2017.

Using precipitation and air temperature forecasts from the Climate Forecast System v2 (CFSv2), the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFSv2) and four products from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), here we show that the IITM ensemble mean (mean of all four products from the IITM) can be used operationally to provide a hydrologic forecast in India at a 7-45-day accumulation period. The IITM ensemble mean forecast was further improved using bias correction for precipitation and air temperature. Bias corrected precipitation forecast showed an improvement of 2.1-mm (on the all-India median mean absolute error-MAE), while all-India median bias corrected temperature forecast was improved by 2.1-°C for a 45-day accumulation period. Moreover, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model simulated forecast of runoff and soil moisture successfully captured the observed anomalies during the severe drought years.

It has been widely evaluated at the canopy scale, where aerodynamic and canopy resistance to water vapour are difficult to estimate directly, leading to various empirical corrections when scaling from leaf to canopy. Here, we evaluated the PM equation directly at the leaf scale, using a detailed leaf energy balance model and direct measurements in a controlled, insulated wind tunnel using artificial leaves with fixed and predefined stomatal conductance. Experimental results were consistent with a detailed leaf energy balance model; however, the results revealed systematic deviations from PM-predicted fluxes, which pointed to fundamental problems with the PM equation. Detailed analysis of the derivation by Monteith(1965) and subsequent amendments revealed two errors: one in neglecting two-sided exchange of sensible heat by a planar leaf, and the other related to the representation of hypostomatous leaves, which are very common in temperate climates. The omission of two-sided sensible heat flux led to bias in simulated latent heat flux by the PM equation, which was as high as 50% of the observed flux in some experiments. Furthermore, we found that the neglect of feedbacks between leaf temperature and radiative energy exchange can lead to additional bias in both latent and sensible heat fluxes. A corrected set of analytical solutions for leaf temperature as well as latent and sensible heat flux is presented, and comparison with the original PM equation indicates a major improvement in reproducing experimental results at the leaf scale. The errors in the original PM equation and its failure to reproduce experimental results at the leaf scale (for which it was originally derived) propagate into inaccurate sensitivities of transpiration and sensible heat fluxes to changes in atmospheric conditions, such as those associated with climate change (even with reasonable present-day performance after calibration). The new formulation presented here rectifies some of the shortcomings of the PM equation and could provide a more robust starting point for canopy representation and climate change studies. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:33","2018-01-19 23:02:33","","685-706","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; evapotranspiration; climate change; experimental study; Plants (botany); Heat flux; latent heat flux; aerodynamics; Energy balance; Wind tunnels; Sensible heat flux; flux measurement; water vapor; Systematic deviation; Transpiration; Penman-Monteith equation; sensible heat flux; Energy balance models; Transpiration rates; Sandwich structures; Atmospheric conditions; Canopy representation; Penman-Monteith equations; stomatal conductance; Stomatal conductance; temperate environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such stormwater predictions in turn require reliable rainfall information. Especially for urban centres, the problem is that the spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall observations should be substantially higher than commonly provided by weather services with their standard rainfall monitoring networks. Commercial microwave links (CMLs) are non-traditional sensors, which have been proposed about a decade ago as a promising solution. CMLs are line-of-sight radio connections widely used by operators of mobile telecommunication networks. They are typically very dense in urban areas and can provide path-integrated rainfall observations at sub-minute resolution. Unfortunately, quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) from CMLs are often highly biased due to several epistemic uncertainties, which significantly limit their usability. In this manuscript we therefore suggest a novel method to reduce this bias by adjusting QPEs to existing rain gauges. The method has been specifically designed to produce reliable results even with comparably distant rain gauges or cumulative observations. This eliminates the need to install reference gauges and makes it possible to work with existing information. First, the method is tested on data from a dedicated experiment, where a CML has been specifically set up for rainfall monitoring experiments, as well as operational CMLs from an existing cellular network. Second, we assess the performance for several experimental layouts of <q>ground truth</q> from rain gauges (RGs) with different spatial and temporal resolutions. The results suggest that CMLs adjusted by RGs with a temporal aggregation of up to 1ĝh (i) provide precise high-resolution QPEs (relative errorĝ &lt;&thinsp;7ĝ%, Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency coefficientĝ &gt; ĝ0.75) and (ii) that the combination of both sensor types clearly outperforms each individual monitoring system. Unfortunately, adjusting CML observations to RGs with longer aggregation intervals of up to 24ĝh has drawbacks. Although it substantially reduces bias, it unfavourably smoothes out rainfall peaks of high intensities, which is undesirable for stormwater management. A similar, but less severe, effect occurs due to spatial averaging when CMLs are adjusted to remote RGs. Nevertheless, even here, adjusted CMLs perform better than RGs alone. Furthermore, we provide first evidence that the joint use of multiple CMLs together with RGs also reduces bias in their QPEs. In summary, we believe that our adjustment method has great potential to improve the space&ndash;time resolution of current urban rainfall monitoring networks. Nevertheless, future work should aim to better understand the reason for the observed systematic error in QPEs from CMLs. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:36","2018-01-19 23:02:36","","617-634","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; prediction; rainfall; urbanization; Uncertainty analysis; runoff; urban area; Storm-water managements; Storms; Spatial and temporal resolutions; precipitation assessment; Storm sewers; resolution; Gages; raingauge; monitoring system; Rain gages; Microwave sensors; Temporal aggregation; Rainfall monitoring network; Efficiency coefficient; Epistemic uncertainties; Individual monitoring; Microwave links; microwave radiation; Mobile telecommunication networks; severe weather","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we provide 3 years of rainfall and throughfall data in a tropical secondary dipterocarp forest characterized by few large trees in northern Thailand, along with selected soil moisture dynamics, to address this issue. Throughfall was an estimated 88ĝ€% of rainfall, varying from 86 to 90ĝ€% in individual years. Data from 167 events demonstrate that canopy interception was only weakly associated (via a nonlinear relationship) with total event rainfall, but not significantly correlated with duration, mean intensity, or antecedent 2-day precipitation (API2). Mean interception during small events (≤ ĝ€35ĝ€mm) was 17ĝ€% (<i>n</i>ĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€135 events) compared with only 7ĝ€% for large events (&gt;ĝ€35ĝ€mm; <i>n</i>ĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€32). Examining small temporal intervals within the largest and highest intensity events that would potentially trigger landslides revealed complex patterns of interception. The tropical forest canopy had little smoothing effect on incident rainfall during the largest events. During events with high peak intensities, high wind speeds, and/or moderate-to-high pre-event wetting, measured throughfall was occasionally higher than rainfall during large event peaks, demonstrating limited buffering. However, in events with little wetting and low-to-moderate wind speed, early event rainfall peaks were buffered by the canopy. As rainfall continued during most large events, there was little difference between rainfall and throughfall depths. A comparison of both rainfall and throughfall depths to conservative mean intensity-duration thresholds for landslide initiation revealed that throughfall exceeded the threshold in 75ĝ€% of the events in which rainfall exceeded the threshold for both wet and dry conditions. Throughfall intensity for the 11 largest events (rainfallĝ€ Combining double low line ĝ€65-116ĝ€mm) plotted near or above the intensity-duration threshold for landslide initiation during wet conditions; 5 of the events were near or above the threshold for dry conditions. Soil moisture responses during large events were heavily and progressively buffered at depths of 1 to 2ĝ€m, indicating that the timescale of any short-term smoothing of peak rainfall inputs (i.e., ≤ ĝ€1ĝ€h) has little influence on peak pore water pressure at depths where landslides would initiate in this area. Given these findings, we conclude that canopy interception would have little effect on mitigating shallow landslide initiation during the types of monsoon rainfall conditions in this and similar tropical secondary forest sites. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:39","2018-01-19 23:02:39","","651-667","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; forest canopy; rainfall; soil moisture; monsoon; tropical forest; Wind; Water; Forestry; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; Soils; landslide; Landslides; Thailand; timescale; Non-linear relationships; Moisture; Canopy interception; interception; Tropics; Soil moisture dynamics; Wetting; porewater; pore pressure; Pore pressure; Pore-water pressures; Pressure distribution; secondary forest; Shallow landslide; Temporal intervals; throughfall; Total event rainfalls; Tropical secondary forests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The temporal variability of MSWEP was determined by weighted averaging of P anomalies from seven datasets; two based solely on interpolation of gauge observations (CPC Unified and GPCC), three on satellite remote sensing (CMORPH, GSMaP-MVK, and TMPA 3B42RT), and two on atmospheric model reanalysis (ERA-Interim and JRA-55). For each grid cell, the weight assigned to the gauge-based estimates was calculated from the gauge network density, while the weights assigned to the satellite- and reanalysis-based estimates were calculated from their comparative performance at the surrounding gauges. The quality of MSWEP was compared against four state-of-the-art gauge-adjusted P datasets (WFDEI-CRU, GPCP-1DD, TMPA 3B42, and CPC Unified) using independent P data from 125 FLUXNET tower stations around the globe. MSWEP obtained the highest daily correlation coefficient (R) among the five P datasets for 60.0% of the stations and a median R of 0.67 vs. 0.44-0.59 for the other datasets. We further evaluated the performance of MSWEP using hydrological modeling for 9011 catchments (&lt; 50 000 km/2) across the globe. Specifically, we calibrated the simple conceptual hydrological model HBV (Hydrologiska Byräns Vattenbalansavdelning) against daily Q observations with P from each of the different datasets. For the 1058 sparsely gauged catchments, representative of 83.9 % of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), MSWEP obtained a median calibration NSE of 0.52 vs. 0.29-0.39 for the other P datasets.

While statistical models used to predict constituent concentrations have been developed considerably over the last few years, measures of uncertainty on constituent loads are rarely reported. Loads are the product of two predictions, constituent concentration and discharge, integrated over a time period, which does not make it straightforward to produce a standard error or a confidence interval. In this paper, a linear mixed model is used to estimate sediment concentrations. A bootstrap method is then developed that accounts for the uncertainty in the concentration and discharge predictions, allowing temporal correlation in the constituent data, and can be used when data transformations are required. The method was tested for a small watershed in Northwest Vietnam for the period 2010-2011. The results showed that confidence intervals were asymmetric, with the highest uncertainty in the upper limit, and that a load of 6262 Mg year-1 had a 95% confidence interval of (4331, 12 267) in 2010 and a load of 5543 Mg an interval of (3593, 8975) in 2011. Additionally, the approach demonstrated that direct estimates from the data were biased downwards compared to bootstrap median estimates. These results imply that constituent loads predicted from regression-type water quality models could frequently be underestimating sediment yields and their environmental impact. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:45","2018-01-19 23:02:45","","571-588","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; correlation; discharge; water quality; Statistical methods; bootstrapping; Sediments; Forecasting; watershed; Environmental impact; uncertainty analysis; irrigation system; Soil pollution; Reservoirs (water); Water quality models; Financial data processing; confidence interval; sediment analysis; Sediment concentration; sediment yield; Reservoir sedimentation; Viet Nam; Discharge predictions; Temporal correlations; environmental effect; Bootstrap confidence interval; Environmental process; Irrigation channels; siltation; soil fertility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike the streamflow hydrograph, they describe the movement and storage of water within and throughout the hydrological system. Until recently, studies using such travel-time distributions have generally either been applied to lumped models or to real-world catchments using available time series, e.g., stable isotopes. Whereas the former are limited in their realism and lack information on the spatial arrangements of the relevant quantities, the latter are limited in their use of available data sets. In our study, we employ the spatially distributed mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) and apply it to a catchment in central Germany. Being able to draw on multiple large data sets for calibration and verification, we generate a large array of spatially distributed states and fluxes. These hydrological outputs are then used to compute the travel-time distributions for every grid cell in the modeling domain. A statistical analysis indicates the general soundness of the upscaling scheme employed in mHM and reveals precipitation, saturated soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration as important predictors for explaining the spatial heterogeneity of mean travel times. In addition, we demonstrate and discuss the high information content of mean travel times for characterization of internal hydrological processes. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:48","2018-01-19 23:02:48","","549-570","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Runoff; catchment; hydrological cycle; potential evapotranspiration; soil moisture; streamflow; heterogeneity; calibration; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; Catchments; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; Digital storage; precipitation assessment; Spatial heterogeneity; Potential evapotranspiration; Moisture; Soil moisture dynamics; travel time; Travel time; Travel time distributions; Characterization; Calibration and verification; hydrographic survey; Spatial arrangements; Streamflow hydrograph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it has been proposed that the D-excess of water vapour (dv =δ2H-8× δ18O) can provide a diagnostic tracer of continental moisture recycling. However, D-excess exhibits a diurnal cycle that has been observed across a variety of ecosystems and may be influenced by a range of processes beyond regional-scale moisture recycling, including local evaporation (ET) fluxes. There is a lack of measurements of D-excess in evaporation (ET) fluxes, which has made it difficult to assess how ET fluxes modify the Dexcess in water vapour (dv). With this in mind, we employed a chamber-based approach to directly measure D-excess in ET (dET) fluxes. We show that ET fluxes imposed a negative forcing on the ambient vapour and could not explain the higher daytime dv values. The low dET observed here was sourced from a soil water pool that had undergone an extended drying period, leading to low D-excess in the soil moisture pool. A strong correlation between daytime dv and locally measured relative humidity was consistent with an oceanic moisture source, suggesting that remote hydrological processes were the major contributor to daytime dv variability. During the early evening, ET fluxes into a shallow nocturnal inversion layer caused a lowering of dv values near the surface. In addition, transient mixing of vapour with a higher D-excess from above the nocturnal inversion modified these values, causing large variability during the night. These results indicate dET can generally be expected to show large spatial and temporal variability and to depend on the soil moisture state. For long periods between rain events, common in semi-arid environments, ET would be expected to impose negative forcing on the surface dv. Spatial and temporal variability of D-excess in ET fluxes therefore needs to be considered when using dv to study moisture recycling and during extended dry periods with weak moisture recycling may act as a tracer of the relative humidity at the oceanic moisture source. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:51","2018-01-19 23:02:51","","533-548","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evapotranspiration; soil moisture; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; spatial variation; Hydrological process; temporal variation; Recycling; Water recycling; Moisture; Strong correlation; moisture content; Moisture sources; isotopic composition; Spatial and temporal variability; water vapor; Evaporation; air-soil interaction; Water vapor; Land atmosphere interaction; relative humidity; Semi-arid environments; inversion layer; Stable isotopic compositions; Traditional measurement techniques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empirical models are more readily used because of their simplicity and the associated lower data requirements. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the capability of some empirical models to mimic the RWU distribution under varying environmental conditions predicted from numerical simulations with a detailed physical model. A review of some empirical models used as sub-models in ecohydrological models is presented, and alternative empirical RWU models are proposed. All these empirical models are analogous to the standard Feddes model, but differ in how RWU is partitioned over depth or how the transpiration reduction function is defined. The parameters of the empirical models are determined by inverse modelling of simulated depth-dependent RWU. The performance of the empirical models and their optimized empirical parameters depends on the scenario. The standard empirical Feddes model only performs well in scenarios with low root length density R, i.e. for scenarios with low RWU ""compensation"". For medium and high R, the Feddes RWU model cannot mimic properly the root uptake dynamics as predicted by the physical model. The Jarvis RWU model in combination with the Feddes reduction function (JMf) only provides good predictions for low and medium R scenarios. For high R, it cannot mimic the uptake patterns predicted by the physical model. Incorporating a newly proposed reduction function into the Jarvis model improved RWU predictions. Regarding the ability of the models to predict plant transpiration, all models accounting for compensation show good performance. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) indicates that the Jarvis (2010) model (JMII), with no empirical parameters to be estimated, is the ""best model"". The proposed models are better in predicting RWU patterns similar to the physical model. The statistical indices point to them as the best alternatives for mimicking RWU predictions of the physical model. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:54","2018-01-19 23:02:54","","473-493","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evapotranspiration; prediction; ecohydrology; Environmental conditions; data processing; Forecasting; empirical analysis; benchmarking; Hydraulic parameters; water uptake; environmental conditions; Transpiration; Eco-hydrological models; Akaike information criterion; compensation; Empirical parameters; Plant transpiration; Root length density; root system; Statistical indices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the use of non-invasive EMI for imaging spatial soil properties is very attractive, the dependence of ECa on several factors challenges any interpretation with respect to individual soil properties or states such as soil moisture (θ). The major aim of this study was to further investigate the potential of repeated EMI measurements to map θ, with particular focus on the temporal variability of the spatial patterns of ECa and θ. To this end, we compared repeated EMI measurements with high-resolution θ data from a wireless soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring network for an extensively managed hillslope area for which soil properties and θ dynamics are known. For the investigated site, (i) ECa showed small temporal variations whereas θ varied from very dry to almost saturation, (ii) temporal changes of the spatial pattern of ECa differed from those of the spatial pattern of θ, and (iii) the ECa&ndash;θ relationship varied with time. Results suggest that (i) depending upon site characteristics, stable soil properties can be the major control of ECa measured with EMI, and (ii) for soils with low clay content, the influence of θ on ECa may be confounded by changes of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution. Further, this study discusses the complex interplay between factors controlling ECa and θ, and the use of EMI-based ECa data with respect to hydrological applications. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:57","2018-01-19 23:02:57","","495-513","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","soil moisture; field method; mapping method; Mapping; model validation; Soil moisture; Soils; hillslope; Complex networks; Soil surveys; imaging method; monitoring system; Moisture; soil temperature; Moisture control; Soil moisture monitoring; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Temporal variability; Temporal variation; Electric conductivity; Electromagnetic induction; Electromagnetic inductions (EMI); electromagnetic method; Apparent electrical conductivity; clay soil; EMI measurements; Site characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently available experimental data on people instability in floodwaters suffer from a large dispersion primarily depending on the large variability of the physical characteristics of the subjects. This paper introduces a dimensionless mobility parameter θP for people partly immersed in flood flows, which accounts for both flood and subject characteristics. The parameter θP is capable of identifying a unique threshold of instability depending on a Froude number, thus reducing the scatter of existing experimental data. Moreover, a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model describing the detailed geometry of a human body and reproducing a selection of critical pairs of water depth and velocity is presented. The numerical results in terms of hydrodynamic forces and force coefficients are analysed and discussed. Both the mobility parameter θP and the numerical results hint at the crucial role of the Froude number and relative submergence as the most relevant dimensionless numbers to interpret the loss of stability. Finally, the mobility parameter θP is compared with an analogous dimensionless parameter for vehicles' instability in floodwaters, providing a new contribution to support flood risk management and educating people. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:02:59","2018-01-19 23:02:59","","515-531","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Risk management; Floods; flooding; Flood control; risk assessment; numerical model; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; disaster management; Flood risk management; safety; Stability; dimensionless number; Threedimensional (3-d); Dimensionless number; Dimensionless parameters; environmental education; Froude number; hydrodynamic force; Hydrodynamic forces; Mobility parameters; pedestrian; Physical characteristics; Threshold of instability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, incorporating the processes governing water movement through a chalk unsaturated zone in a numerical model is complicated mainly due to the fractured nature of chalk that creates high-velocity preferential flow paths in the subsurface. In general, flow through a chalk unsaturated zone is simulated using the dual-porosity concept, which often involves calibration of a relatively large number of model parameters, potentially undermining applications to large regions. In this study, a simplified parameterization, namely the Bulk Conductivity (BC) model, is proposed for simulating hydrology in a chalk unsaturated zone. This new parameterization introduces only two additional parameters (namely the macroporosity factor and the soil wetness threshold parameter for fracture flow activation) and uses the saturated hydraulic conductivity from the chalk matrix. The BC model is implemented in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) and applied to a study area encompassing the Kennet catchment in the southern UK. This parameterization is further calibrated at the point scale using soil moisture profile observations. The performance of the calibrated BC model in JULES is assessed and compared against the performance of both the default JULES parameterization and the uncalibrated version of the BC model implemented in JULES. Finally, the model performance at the catchment scale is evaluated against independent data sets (e.g. runoff and latent heat flux). The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the BC model in JULES improves simulated land surface mass and energy fluxes over the chalk-dominated Kennet catchment. Therefore, the simple approach described in this study may be used to incorporate the flow processes through a chalk unsaturated zone in large-scale land surface modelling applications. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:03","2018-01-19 23:03:03","","459-471","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Runoff; United Kingdom; Water resources; chalk; soil moisture; land surface; Groundwater flow; preferential flow; Surface measurement; Groundwater; water resource; numerical model; management practice; Management practices; Catchments; Hydrology; Soil moisture; vadose zone; Hydrological process; Parameterization; porous medium; Heat flux; subsurface flow; hydraulic conductivity; resource assessment; England; Limestone; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Fracture; Porosity; Porous materials; Soil moisture profiles; Chalk unsaturated zone; fracture flow; Kennet River; Land surface modelling; Resource assessments; Threshold parameters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These observations are consistent with theoretical considerations of a warming climate. However, until recently these trends have not been shown to consistently affect dry regions over land. A recent study, published by Donat et al. (2016), now identified significant increases in annual-maximum daily extreme precipitation (Rx1d) and annual precipitation totals (PRCPTOT) in dry regions. Here, we revisit the applied methods and explore the sensitivity of changes in precipitation extremes and annual totals to alternative choices of defining a dry region (i.e. in terms of aridity as opposed to precipitation characteristics alone). We find that (a) statistical artifacts introduced by data pre-processing based on a time-invariant reference period lead to an overestimation of the reported trends by up to 40%, and that (b) the reported trends of globally aggregated extremes and annual totals are highly sensitive to the definition of a ""dry region of the globe"". For example, using the same observational dataset, accounting for the statistical artifacts, and based on different aridity-based dryness definitions, we find a reduction in the positive trend of Rx1d from the originally reported +1.6%decade-1 to +0.2 to +0.9%decade-1 (period changes for 1981-2010 averages relative to 1951-1980 are reduced to -1.32 to +0.97% as opposed to +4.85% in the original study). If we include additional but less homogenized data to cover larger regions, the global trend increases slightly (Rx1d: +0.4 to +1.1%decade-1), and in this case we can indeed confirm (partly) significant increases in Rx1d. However, these globally aggregated estimates remain uncertain as considerable gaps in long-term observations in the Earth's arid and semi-arid regions remain. In summary, adequate data pre-processing and accounting for uncertainties regarding the definition of dryness are crucial to the quantification of spatially aggregated trends in precipitation extremes in the world's dry regions. In view of the high relevance of the question to many potentially affected stakeholders, we call for a well-reflected choice of specific data processing methods and the inclusion of alternative dryness definitions to guarantee that communicated results related to climate change be robust. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:06","2018-01-19 23:03:06","","441-458","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Extreme precipitation; trend analysis; climate change; data processing; Data handling; Precipitation (meteorology); extreme event; precipitation assessment; semiarid region; arid region; Precipitation extremes; Annual precipitation; Arid and semi-arid regions; long-term change; aridity; Data processing methods; Long term observations; Precipitation characteristics; Statistical artifacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although model comparison studies are very valuable for international cooperation, they do often not lead to very clear new insights regarding the relevance of the modelled processes. We hypothesise that this is partly caused by model complexity and the comparison methods used, which focus too much on a good overall performance instead of focusing on a variety of specific events. In this study, we use an approach that focuses on the evaluation of specific events and characteristics. Eight international research groups calibrated their hourly model on the Ourthe catchment in Belgium and carried out a validation in time for the Ourthe catchment and a validation in space for nested and neighbouring catchments. The same protocol was followed for each model and an ensemble of best-performing parameter sets was selected. Although the models showed similar performances based on general metrics (i.e. the Nash&ndash;Sutcliffe efficiency), clear differences could be observed for specific events. We analysed the hydrographs of these specific events and conducted three types of statistical analyses on the entire time series: cumulative discharges, empirical extreme value distribution of the peak flows and flow duration curves for low flows. The results illustrate the relevance of including a very quick flow reservoir preceding the root zone storage to model peaks during low flows and including a slow reservoir in parallel with the fast reservoir to model the recession for the studied catchments. This intercomparison enhanced the understanding of the hydrological functioning of the catchment, in particular for low flows, and enabled to identify present knowledge gaps for other parts of the hydrograph. Above all, it helped to evaluate each model against a set of alternative models. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:08","2018-01-19 23:03:08","","423-440","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Flow duration curve; Runoff; Time series analysis; catchment; reservoir; statistical analysis; hydrological modeling; comparative study; research work; model test; Catchments; Hydrological modeling; complexity; guideline; Reservoirs (water); Belgium; Comparison methods; Extreme value distributions; International collaborations; international comparison; International cooperation; International model; International researches; Research institutes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, parameter calibration efficiency has a direct relation with parameter range. Furthermore, parameter range selection is affected by probability distribution of parameter values, parameter sensitivity, and correlation. A newly proposed method is employed to determine the optimal combination of multi-parameter ranges for improving the calibration of hydrological models. At first, the probability distribution was specified for each parameter of the model based on genetic algorithm (GA) calibration. Then, several ranges were selected for each parameter according to the corresponding probability distribution, and subsequently the optimal range was determined by comparing the model results calibrated with the different selected ranges. Next, parameter correlation and sensibility were evaluated by quantifying two indexes, RCY;X and SE, which can be used to coordinate with the negatively correlated parameters to specify the optimal combination of ranges of all parameters for calibrating models. It is shown from the investigation that the probability distribution of calibrated values of any particular parameter in a Xinanjiang model approaches a normal or exponential distribution. The multi-parameter optimal range selection method is superior to the single-parameter one for calibrating hydrological models with multiple parameters. The combination of optimal ranges of all parameters is not the optimum inasmuch as some parameters have negative effects on other parameters. The application of the proposed methodology gives rise to an increase of 0.01 in minimum Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) compared with that of the pure GA method. The rising of minimum ENS with little change of the maximum may shrink the range of the possible solutions, which can effectively reduce uncertainty of the model performance. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:11","2018-01-19 23:03:11","","393-407","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; genetic algorithm; probability; hydrological modeling; calibration; Probability distributions; Hydrology; Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Exponential distributions; Hydrological model calibrations; Probability; Parameter calibration; coordinate; Correlated parameters; Multiple parameters; Optimal combination; Parameter correlation; Parameter sensitivities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the ability to reproduce the two drought peaks in 2002 and 2006 was investigated. Overall, the RCM was found to reproduce both the temporal and the spatial structure of the drought-related precipitation anomalies quite well, despite using climatological seasonal surface characteristics such as vegetation fraction and albedo. This result concurs with previous studies that found that about two-thirds of the precipitation decline can be attributed to the El Ninõ&ndash;Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Simulation experiments that allowed the vegetation fraction and albedo to vary as observed illustrated that the intensity of the drought was underestimated by about 10ĝ% when using climatological surface characteristics. These results suggest that in terms of drought development, capturing the feedbacks related to vegetation and albedo changes may be as important as capturing the soil moisture&ndash;precipitation feedback. In order to improve our modelling of multi-year droughts, the challenge is to capture all these related surface changes simultaneously, and provide a comprehensive description of land surface&ndash;precipitation feedback during the droughts development. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:14","2018-01-19 23:03:14","","409-422","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Southern oscillation; Vegetation; drought; soil moisture; Climatology; climate modeling; land surface; regional climate; Drought; vegetation cover; Climate models; Surface measurement; Soil moisture; precipitation (climatology); El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Precipitation anomalies; Atmospheric pressure; Solar radiation; Regional climate modeling (RCM); albedo; Land surface albedo; Millennium droughts; Surface characteristics; Vegetation feedbacks; Vegetation fractions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to improve the performance of the 1-D freshwater lake (FLake) model using satellite-derived Kd for Lake Erie. The CoastColour algorithm was applied to MERIS satellite imagery to estimate Kd. The constant (0.2m1) and satellite-derived Kd values as well as radiation fluxes and meteorological station observations were then used to run FLake for a meteorological station on Lake Erie. Results improved compared to using the constant Kd value (0.2m1). No significant improvement was found in FLake-simulated lake surface water temperature (LSWT) when Kd variations in time were considered using a monthly average. Therefore, results suggest that a timeindependent, lake-specific, and constant satellite-derived Kd value can reproduce LSWT with sufficient accuracy for the Lake Erie station. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of various Kd values on the simulation outputs. Results show that FLake is sensitive to variations in Kd to estimate the thermal structure of Lake Erie. Dark waters result in warmer spring and colder fall temperatures compared to clear waters. Dark waters always produce colder mean water column temperature (MWCT) and lake bottom water temperature (LBWT), shallower mixed layer depth (MLD), longer ice cover duration, and thicker ice. The sensitivity of FLake to Kd variations was more pronounced in the simulation of MWCT, LBWT, and MLD. The model was particularly sensitive to Kd values below 0.5m-1. This is the first study to assess the value of integrating Kd from the satellite-based CoastColour algorithm into the FLake model. Satellite-derived Kd is found to be a useful input parameter for simulations with FLake and possibly other lake models, and it has potential for applicability to other lakes where Kd is not commonly measured. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:16","2018-01-19 23:03:16","","377-391","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; algorithm; sensitivity analysis; Temperature; Meteorology; Satellites; Great Lakes [North America]; Lakes; Surface waters; water column; water temperature; satellite imagery; extinction coefficient; Light extinction; Light extinction coefficients; thermal structure; Thermal structure; Fresh water lakes; bottom water; Lake Erie; Satellite imagery; Meteorological station; thermal regime; Extinction coefficients; MERIS; Mixed layer depths; Simulation outputs; Surface water temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brightness temperatures are key in this process, as they are the main input in the retrieval algorithm which yields SSM estimates. The work exposed compares brightness temperatures measured by the SMOS mission to two different sets of modelled ones, over the Iberian Peninsula from 2010 to 2012. The two modelled sets were estimated using a radiative transfer model and state variables from two land-surface models: (i) ORCHIDEE and (ii) H-TESSEL. The radiative transfer model used is the CMEM. Measured and modelled brightness temperatures show a good agreement in their temporal evolution, but their spatial structures are not consistent. An empirical orthogonal function analysis of the brightness temperature's error identifies a dominant structure over the south-west of the Iberian Peninsula which evolves during the year and is maximum in autumn and winter. Hypotheses concerning forcing-induced biases and assumptions made in the radiative transfer model are analysed to explain this inconsistency, but no candidate is found to be responsible for the weak spatial correlations at the moment. Further hypotheses are proposed and will be explored in a forthcoming paper. The analysis of spatial inconsistencies between modelled and measured TBs is important, as these can affect the estimation of geophysical variables and TB assimilation in operational models, as well as result in misleading validation studies. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:19","2018-01-19 23:03:19","","357-375","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iberian Peninsula; algorithm; soil moisture; spatial analysis; seasonality; Temperature; comparative study; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Spatial correlations; empirical orthogonal function analysis; Orthogonal functions; radiative transfer; Radiative transfer; Atmospheric humidity; brightness temperature; Brightness temperatures; Luminance; SMOS; surface temperature; Land surface models; Surface soil moisture; Retrieval algorithms; Empirical orthogonal function analysis; Radiative transfer model; radiometric survey; Radiometry; Temporal evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many urban water systems are designed using time series with a high temporal resolution. To assess the impact of climate change on these systems, similarly high-resolution precipitation time series for future climate are necessary. Climate models cannot at their current resolutions provide these time series at the relevant scales. Known methods for stochastic downscaling of climate change to urban hydrological scales have known shortcomings in constructing realistic climate-changed precipitation time series at the sub-hourly scale. In the present study we present a deterministic methodology to perturb historical precipitation time series at the minute scale to reflect non-linear expectations to climate change. The methodology shows good skill in meeting the expectations to climate change in extremes at the event scale when evaluated at different timescales from the minute to the daily scale. The methodology also shows good skill with respect to representing expected changes of seasonal precipitation. The methodology is very robust against the actual magnitude of the expected changes as well as the direction of the changes (increase or decrease), even for situations where the extremes are increasing for seasons that in general should have a decreasing trend in precipitation. The methodology can provide planners with valuable time series representing future climate that can be used as input to urban hydrological models and give better estimates of climate change impacts on these systems. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:22","2018-01-19 23:03:22","","345-355","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Time series; water supply; climate modeling; Hydrological models; seasonality; climate change; water management; hydrological modeling; Climate models; distribution system; testing method; Stochastic systems; Urban water systems; Climate change impact; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); urban planning; infrastructure planning; timescale; Reliable estimates; High temporal resolution; Seasonal precipitations; coal supply; Current resolution; Precipitation time series","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current hydrology literature, Kc has been widely used as a parameter to estimate crop water demand by water managers but has not been well examined for other types of ecosystems such as forests and other perennial vegetation. Understanding the seasonal dynamics of this variable for all ecosystems is important for projecting the ecohydrological responses to climate change and accurately quantifying water use at watershed to global scales. This study aimed at deriving monthly Kc for multiple vegetation cover types and understanding its environmental controls by analyzing the accumulated global eddy flux (FLUXNET) data. We examined monthly Kc data for seven vegetation covers, including open shrubland (OS), cropland (CRO), grassland (GRA), deciduous broad leaf forest (DBF), evergreen needle leaf forest (ENF), evergreen broad leaf forest (EBF), and mixed forest (MF), across 81 sites. We found that, except for evergreen forests (EBF and ENF), Kc values had large seasonal variation across all land covers. The spatial variability of Kc was well explained by latitude, suggesting site factors are a major control on Kc. Seasonally, Kc increased significantly with precipitation in the summer months, except in EBF. Moreover, leaf area index (LAI) significantly influenced monthly Kc in all land covers, except in EBF. During the peak growing season, forests had the highest Kc values, while croplands (CRO) had the lowest. We developed a series of multivariate linear monthly regression models for Kc by land cover type and season using LAI, site latitude, and monthly precipitation as independent variables. The Kc models are useful for understanding water stress in different ecosystems under climate change and variability as well as for estimating seasonal ET for large areas with mixed land covers. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:25","2018-01-19 23:03:25","","311-322","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Rain; Regression analysis; Vegetation; evapotranspiration; seasonality; climate change; Ecology; environmental factor; vegetation cover; Climate models; Ecosystems; Crops; global perspective; Water supply; Forestry; Independent variables; water stress; Plants (botany); precipitation (climatology); forest ecosystem; eddy covariance; flux measurement; leaf area index; Spatial variability; Seasonal variation; land type; environmental effect; Environmental engineering; Environmental control; Evergreen forests; Land-cover types; Seasonal dynamics; Vegetation cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the evaluation of large-scale evaporation retrievals is not a straightforward task. While a number of studies have intercompared a range of these evaporation products by examining the variance amongst them, or by comparison of pixel-scale retrievals against ground-based observations, there is a need to explore more appropriate techniques to comprehensively evaluate remote-sensing-based estimates. One possible approach is to establish the level of product agreement between related hydrological components: for instance, how well do evaporation patterns and response match with precipitation or water storage changes? To assess the suitability of this <q>consistency</q>-based approach for evaluating evaporation products, we focused our investigation on four globally distributed basins in arid and semi-arid environments, comprising the Colorado River basin, Niger River basin, Aral Sea basin, and Lake Eyre basin. In an effort to assess retrieval quality, three satellite-based global evaporation products based on different methodologies and input data, including CSIRO-PML, the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration product (MOD16), and Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM), were evaluated against rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) along with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) water storage anomalies. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluated consistency using a degree correlation approach after transforming both evaporation and precipitation data into spherical harmonics. Overall we found no persistent hydrological consistency in these dryland environments. Indeed, the degree correlation showed oscillating values between periods of low and high water storage changes, with a phase difference of about 2-3 months. Interestingly, after imposing a simple lag in GRACE data to account for delayed surface runoff or baseflow components, an improved match in terms of degree correlation was observed in the Niger River basin. Significant improvements to the degree correlations (from ∼0 to about 0.6) were also found in the Colorado River basin for both the CSIRO-PML and GLEAM products, while MOD16 showed only half of that improvement. In other basins, the variability in the temporal pattern of degree correlations remained considerable and hindered any clear differentiation between the evaporation products. Even so, it was found that a constant lag of 2 months provided a better fit compared to other alternatives, including a zero lag. From a product assessment perspective, no significant or persistent advantage could be discerned across any of the three evaporation products in terms of a sustained hydrological consistency with precipitation and water storage anomaly data. As a result, our analysis has implications in terms of the confidence that can be placed in independent retrievals of the hydrological cycle, raises questions on inter-product quality, and highlights the need for additional techniques to evaluate large-scale products. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:28","2018-01-19 23:03:28","","323-343","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Evapotranspiration; Rain; evaporation; hydrological cycle; satellite data; GRACE; Rivers; runoff; Metadata; Watersheds; Water supply; Remote sensing; Precipitation (meteorology); water storage; Digital storage; Quality control; precipitation assessment; hydrological response; semiarid region; South Australia; MODIS; Geodetic satellites; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Evaporation; Ground-based observations; pixel; Colorado Basin [North America]; Semi-arid environments; Aral Sea; Appropriate techniques; Evaporation products; Global precipitation climatology projects; Lake Eyre Basin; Large-scale products; Niger Basin; Space-based observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Runoff ratio decreased across the catchments with non-stationary hydrologic response with the exception of one catchment in northern Australia. Annual runoff ratio sensitivity to annual fractional vegetation cover was similar to or greater than sensitivity to annual precipitation in most of the catchments with non-stationary hydrologic response indicating vegetation impacts on streamflow. We use precipitation-productivity relationships as the first-order control for ecohydrologic catchment classification. A total of 12 out of 20 catchments present a positive precipitation-productivity relationship possibly enhanced by CO2 fertilization effect.

These models also typically ignore topographically driven lateral redistribution of water (either as groundwater or surface flows), both within and between model grid cells. Here, we present a first attempt to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity and lateral redistribution on grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes. Our approach uses Budyko curves, as a simple model of ET as a function of atmospheric forcing by <i>P</i> and PET. From these Budyko curves, we derive a simple sub-grid closure relation that quantifies how spatial heterogeneity affects average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We show that averaging over sub-grid heterogeneity in P and PET, as typical Earth system models do, leads to overestimations of average ET. For a sample high-relief grid cell in the Himalayas, this overestimation bias is shown to be roughly 12%; for adjacent lower-relief grid cells, it is substantially smaller. We use a similar approach to derive sub-grid closure relations that quantify how lateral redistribution of water could alter average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We derive expressions for the maximum possible effect of lateral redistribution on average ET, and the amount of lateral redistribution required to achieve this effect, using only estimates of P and PET in possible source and recipient locations as inputs. We show that where the aridity index P/PET increases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will increase average ET (and models that overlook lateral redistribution will underestimate average ET). Conversely, where the aridity index P/PET decreases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will decrease average ET. The effects of both sub-grid heterogeneity and lateral redistribution will be most pronounced where P is inversely correlated with PET across the landscape. Our analysis provides first-order estimates of the magnitudes of these sub-grid effects, as a guide for more detailed modeling and analysis. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:36","2018-01-19 23:03:36","","217-233","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; evapotranspiration; potential evapotranspiration; climate modeling; land surface; heterogeneity; Groundwater; Cells; Cytology; precipitation (climatology); Spatial heterogeneity; Potential evapotranspiration; Himalayas; soil column; atmospheric forcing; Atmospheric forcing; Heterogeneous landscapes; Detailed modeling; Earth system model; Land surface properties; Simple modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As with conceptual models, they are limited in data-sparse basins by the lack of streamflow data for calibration. Short periods of observational data (less than 1 year) may be obtained from fragmentary historical records of previously existing gauging stations or from temporary gauging during field surveys, which might be of value for model calibration. However, unlike lumped conceptual models, such an approach has not been explored sufficiently for physically based distributed models. This study explored how the use of limited continuous daily streamflow data might support the application of a physically based distributed model in data-sparse basins. The influence of the length of the observation period on the calibration of the widely applied soil and water assessment tool model was evaluated in four Chinese basins with differing climatic and geophysical characteristics. The evaluations were conducted by comparing calibrations based on short periods of data with calibrations based on data from a 3-year period, which were treated as benchmark calibrations of the four basins, respectively. To ensure the differences in the model simulations solely come from differences in the calibration data, the generalized likelihood uncertainty analysis scheme was employed for the automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis. In the four basins, contrary to the common understanding of the need for observations over a period of several years, data records with lengths of less than 1 year were shown to calibrate the model effectively, i.e., performances similar to the benchmark calibrations were achieved. The models of the wet Jinjiang and Donghe basins could be effectively calibrated using a shorter data record (1 month), compared with the dry Heihe and upstream Yalongjiang basins (6 months). Even though the four basins are very different, when using 1-year or 6-month (covering a whole dry season or rainy season) data, the results show that data from wet seasons and wet years are generally more reliable than data from dry seasons and dry years, especially for the two dry basins. The results demonstrated that this idea could be a promising approach to the problem of calibration of physically based distributed hydrological models in data-sparse basins, and findings from the discussion in this study are valuable for assessing the effectiveness of short-period data for model calibration in real-world applications. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:39","2018-01-19 23:03:39","","251-265","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; dry season; streamflow; Drought; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; soil and water assessment tool; Automatic calibration; calibration; Soil and Water assessment tools; uncertainty analysis; Distributed modeling; Hydrology; river basin; benchmarking; Hydrological simulations; Stream flow; Distributed hydrological model; Historical records; Observation Period; field survey; Observational data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article is a continuation of previous work by Gregow et al. (2013) in the same research field. A new lightning data assimilation method has been implemented and validated within the Finnish Meteorological Institute-Local Analysis and Prediction System. Lightning data do improve the analysis when no radars are available, and even with radar data, lightning data have a positive impact on the results. The radar-gauge assimilation method is highly dependent on statistical relationships between radar and gauges, when performing the correction to the precipitation accumulation field. Here, we investigate the usage of different time integration intervals: 1, 6, 12, 24 h and 7 days. This will change the amount of data used and affect the statistical calculation of the radar-gauge relations. Verification shows that the real-time analysis using the 1 h integration time length gives the best results. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:42","2018-01-19 23:03:42","","267-279","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","radar; statistical analysis; data assimilation; integrated approach; numerical method; Integration; data acquisition; precipitation assessment; Gages; Radar measurement; Radar; Statistical relationship; Intense precipitation; Correction method; Gauge measurements; Lightning; Lightning observations; Local analysis and prediction systems; Real time analysis; Statistical calculations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various studies have unanimously cited the shortwave incoming radiation (Rs) to be the most robust reference variable explaining the ratio between ETd and ETi. This study aims to contribute in ETi upscaling for global studies using the ratio between daily and instantaneous incoming shortwave radiation (Rsd/Rsi) as a factor for converting ETi to ETd.This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning algorithm first to predict RSd from RSi followed by using the RSd/RSi ratio to convert ETi to ETd across different terrestrial ecosystems. Using RSi and RSd observations from multiple sub-networks of the FLUXNET database spread across different climates and biomes (to represent inputs that would typically be obtainable from remote sensors during the overpass time) in conjunction with some astronomical variables (e.g. solar zenith angle, day length, exoatmospheric shortwave radiation), we developed the ANN model for reproducing &lt;i&gt;RSd and further used it to upscale ETi to ETd. The efficiency of the ANN is evaluated for different morning and afternoon times of day, under varying sky conditions, and also at different geographic locations. RS-based upscaled ETd produced a significant linear relation (R2=0.65 to 0.69), low bias (-0.31 to-0.56MJm-2d-1 approx. 4%), and good agreement (RMSE 1.55 to 1.86 MJm-2d-1 approx. 10 %) with the observed ETd, although a systematic overestimation of ETd was also noted under persistent cloudy sky conditions. Inclusion of soil moisture and rainfall information in ANN training reduced the systematic overestimation tendency in predominantly overcast days. An intercomparison with existing upscaling method at daily, 8-day, monthly, and yearly temporal resolution revealed a robust performance of the ANN-driven RS-based ETi upscaling method and was found to produce lowest RMSE under cloudy conditions. Sensitivity analysis revealed variable sensitivity of the method to biome selection and high ETd prediction errors in forest ecosystems are primarily associated with greater rainfall and cloudiness. The overall methodology appears to be promising and has substantial potential for upscaling ETi to ETd for field and regional-scale evapotranspiration mapping studies using polar orbiting satellites. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:45","2018-01-19 23:03:45","","197-215","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; algorithm; artificial neural network; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; sensitivity analysis; remote sensing; machine learning; Ecology; Climate models; Neural networks; Ecosystems; Mapping; Remote sensing; sensor; Soil moisture; forest ecosystem; upscaling; Learning systems; Learning algorithms; Temporal resolution; satellite altimetry; Short-wave radiation; shortwave radiation; Terrestrial ecosystems; Geographic location; Artificial neural network approach; Daily evapotranspirations; Polar-orbiting satellites; Remote sensing applications; Silicon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the long-term dynamics of gully networks and the variations in sediment production in gullies are not well known. Available studies are often conducted only over a few years, while many gully networks form, grow, and change in response to environmental and land use or management changes over a long period. In order to clarify the effect of these changes, it is important to analyse the evolution of the gully network with a high temporal resolution. This study aims at analysing gully morphodynamics over a long timescale (1956-2013) in a large Mediterranean area in order to quantify gully erosion processes and their contribution to overall sediment dynamics. A gully network of 20km2 located in southwestern Spain has been analysed using a sequence of 10 aerial photographs in the period 1956-2013. The extension of the gully network both increased and decreased in the study period. Gully drainage density varied between 1.93km-2 in 1956, a minimum of 1.37km-2 in 1980, and a maximum of 5.40km-2 in 2013. The main controlling factor of gully activity appeared to be rainfall. Land use changes were found to have only a secondary effect. A new Monte Carlo-based approach was proposed to reconstruct gully erosion rates from orthophotos. Gully erosion rates were found to be relatively stable between 1956 and 2009, with a mean value of 11.2tha-1yr-1. In the period 2009-2011, characterized by severe winter rainfalls, this value increased significantly to 591tha-1yr-1. These results show that gully erosion rates are highly variable and that a simple interpolation between the starting and ending dates greatly underestimates gully contribution during certain years, such as, for example, between 2009 and 2011. This illustrates the importance of the methodology applied using a high temporal resolution of orthophotos. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:47","2018-01-19 23:03:47","","235-249","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; interpolation; Spain; Land use; land use planning; Erosion; drainage network; Landforms; precipitation assessment; aerial photography; timescale; Dynamics; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean basin; High temporal resolution; Agricultural areas; Aerial Photographs; sediment yield; morphodynamics; gully erosion; Long term dynamics; Main controlling factors; Mediterranean areas; Sediment production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Satellite-based rainfall products, which allow for a better coverage than both radar network and rain gauges on the Tibetan Plateau, can be suitable alternatives for studies on investigating the hydrological processes and climate change. In this study, a newly developed daily satellite-based precipitation product, termed Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), is used as input for a hydrologic model to simulate streamflow in the upper Yellow and Yangtze River basins on the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the simulated streamflows using PERSIANN-CDR precipitation and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) precipitation are closer to observation than that using limited gauge-based precipitation interpolation in the upper Yangtze River basin. The simulated streamflow using gauge-based precipitation are higher than the streamflow observation during the wet season. In the upper Yellow River basin, gauge-based precipitation, GLDAS precipitation, and PERSIANN-CDR precipitation have similar good performance in simulating streamflow. The evaluation of streamflow simulation capability in this study partly indicates that the PERSIANN-CDR rainfall product has good potential to be a reliable dataset and an alternative information source of a limited gauge network for conducting long-term hydrological and climate studies on the Tibetan Plateau. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:50","2018-01-19 23:03:50","","169-181","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Land data assimilation systems; Rain; artificial neural network; rainfall; satellite data; streamflow; data set; remote sensing; climate change; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Neural networks; Watersheds; Precipitation (meteorology); river basin; Soil moisture; Hydrological process; precipitation (climatology); Gages; raingauge; Stream flow; Rain gages; Precipitation products; Yangtze River; Yellow River Basin; Streamflow simulations; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Alternative information; Climate data records; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information; Precipitation interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impacts of LULC and climate changes on water resources must be assessed in these areas. However, conflicting results regarding the effects of LULC and climate changes on runoff have been reported in relatively large basins, such as the Jinghe River basin (JRB), which is a typical catchment (&gt;45000 km2) located in a semi-humid and arid transition zone on the central Loess Plateau, northwest China. In this study, we focused on quantifying both the combined and isolated impacts of LULC and climate changes on surface runoff. We hypothesized that under climatic warming and drying conditions, LULC changes, which are primarily caused by intensive human activities such as the Grain for Green Program, will considerably alter runoff in the JRB. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was adopted to perform simulations. The simulated results indicated that although runoff increased very little between the 1970s and the 2000s due to the combined effects of LULC and climate changes, LULC and climate changes affected surface runoff differently in each decade, e.g., runoff increased with increased precipitation between the 1970s and the 1980s (precipitation contributed to 88% of the runoff increase). Thereafter, runoff decreased and was increasingly influenced by LULC changes, which contributed to 44% of the runoff changes between the 1980s and 1990s and 71% of the runoff changes between the 1990s and 2000s. Our findings revealed that large-scale LULC under the Grain for Green Program has had an important effect on the hydrological cycle since the late 1990s. Additionally, the conflicting findings regarding the effects of LULC and climate changes on runoff in relatively large basins are likely caused by uncertainties in hydrological simulations. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:53","2018-01-19 23:03:53","","183-196","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Runoff; Water resources; hydrological cycle; land cover; climate change; Land use; water resource; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; Soil and water assessment tool; Catchments; human activity; precipitation (climatology); land use change; Hydrological simulations; semiarid region; Loess Plateau; Hydrological cycles; climate conditions; Arid and semi-arid regions; transition zone; Drying condition; humid environment; Jing Basin; Land use/land cover; limiting factor; Simulated results; Vulnerable ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such flood events therefore need to be addressed with large-scale modelling approaches to capture these processes. Many approaches currently in place are based on either a hydrologic or a hydrodynamic model. However, the resulting lack of interaction between hydrology and hydrodynamics, for instance, by implementing groundwater infiltration on inundated floodplains, can hamper modelled inundation and discharge results where such interactions are important. In this study, the global hydrologic model PCR-GLOBWB at 30ĝ€arcmin spatial resolution was one-directionally and spatially coupled with the hydrodynamic model Delft 3D Flexible Mesh (FM) for the Amazon River basin at a grid-by-grid basis and at a daily time step. The use of a flexible unstructured mesh allows for fine-scale representation of channels and floodplains, while preserving a coarser spatial resolution for less flood-prone areas, thus not unnecessarily increasing computational costs. In addition, we assessed the difference between a 1-D channel/2-D floodplain and a 2-D schematization in Delft 3D FM. Validating modelled discharge results shows that coupling PCR-GLOBWB to a hydrodynamic routing scheme generally increases model performance compared to using a hydrodynamic or hydrologic model only for all validation parameters applied. Closer examination shows that the 1-D/2-D schematization outperforms 2-D for <i>r</i>2 and root mean square error (RMSE) whilst having a lower Kling&ndash;Gupta efficiency (KGE). We also found that spatial coupling has the significant advantage of a better representation of inundation at smaller streams throughout the model domain. A validation of simulated inundation extent revealed that only those set-ups incorporating 1-D channels are capable of representing inundations for reaches below the spatial resolution of the 2-D mesh. Implementing 1-D channels is therefore particularly of advantage for large-scale inundation models, as they are often built upon remotely sensed surface elevation data which often enclose a strong vertical bias, hampering downstream connectivity. Since only a one-directional coupling approach was tested, and therefore important feedback processes are not incorporated, simulated discharge and inundation extent for both coupled set-ups is generally overpredicted. Hence, it will be the subsequent step to extend it to a two-directional coupling scheme to obtain a closed feedback loop between hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes. The current findings demonstrating the potential of one-directionally and spatially coupled models to obtain improved discharge estimates form an important step towards a large-scale inundation model with a full dynamic coupling between hydrology and hydrodynamics. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:03:56","2018-01-19 23:03:56","","117-132","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Groundwater; infiltration; hydrodynamics; floodplain; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; model validation; Hydrology; groundwater flow; Mesh generation; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; spatial resolution; Image resolution; flood wave; Amazon Basin; Hydrodynamic process; Flood wave propagation; Wave propagation; Closed feedback loop; Directional coupling; Ground-water infiltration; Surface elevation data; Validation parameters; wave propagation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to lengthy return intervals and cloud cover, data acquisition is not continuous over time, particularly for satellite sensors operating at medium (∼100 m) or finer resolutions. To fill the data gaps between clear-sky data acquisitions, interpolation methods that take advantage of the relationship between ET and other environmental properties that can be continuously monitored are often used. This study sought to evaluate the accuracy of this approach, which is commonly referred to as temporal upscaling, as a function of satellite revisit interval. Using data collected at 20 Ameriflux sites distributed throughout the contiguous United States and representing four distinct land cover types (cropland, grassland, forest, and open-canopy) as a proxy for perfect retrievals on satellite overpass dates, this study assesses daily ET estimates derived using five different reference quantities (incident solar radiation, net radiation, available energy, reference ET, and equilibrium latent heat flux) and three different interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, and Hermite spline). Not only did the analyses find that the temporal autocorrelation, i.e., persistence, of all of the reference quantities was short, it also found that those land cover types with the greatest ET exhibited the least persistence. This carries over to the error associated with both the various scaled quantities and flux estimates. In terms of both the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), the errors increased rapidly with increasing return interval following a logarithmic relationship. Again, those land cover types with the greatest ET showed the largest errors. Moreover, using a threshold of 20% relative error, this study indicates that a return interval of no more than 5 days is necessary for accurate daily ET estimates. It also found that the spline interpolation methods performed erratically for long return intervals and should be avoided. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:05","2018-01-19 23:04:05","","83-98","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; United States; evapotranspiration; interpolation; land cover; remote sensing; Satellites; spatial distribution; Remote sensing; data acquisition; Errors; Data acquisition; Interpolation; Heat flux; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; upscaling; autocorrelation; Actual evapotranspiration; threshold; satellite sensor; Remotely sensed data; Remotely sensed evapotranspirations; error correction; cloud cover; Environmental property; Incident solar radiation; Logarithmic relationship; Operational applications; Spline interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individually characterizing streamflow recessions often involves describing the similarities and differences between model parameters fitted to each recession time series. Significant methodological sensitivity has been identified in the fitting and parameterization of models that describe populations of many recessions, but the dependence of estimated model parameters on methodological choices has not been evaluated for event-by-event forms of analysis. Here, we use daily streamflow data from 16 catchments in northern California and southern Oregon to investigate how combinations of commonly used streamflow recession definitions and fitting techniques impact parameter estimates of a widely used power law recession model. Results are relevant to watersheds that are relatively steep, forested, and rain-dominated. The highly seasonal mediterranean climate of northern California and southern Oregon ensures study catchments explore a wide range of recession behaviors and wetness states, ideal for a sensitivity analysis. In such catchments, we show the following: (i) methodological decisions, including ones that have received little attention in the literature, can impact parameter value estimates and model goodness of fit; (ii) the central tendencies of event-scale recession parameter probability distributions are largely robust to methodological choices, in the sense that differing methods rank catchments similarly according to the medians of these distributions; (iii) recession parameter distributions are method-dependent, but roughly catchment-independent, such that changing the choices made about a particular method affects a given parameter in similar ways across most catchments; and (iv) the observed correlative relationship between the power-law recession scale parameter and catchment antecedent wetness varies depending on recession definition and fitting choices. Considering study results, we recommend a combination of four key methodological decisions to maximize the quality of fitted recession curves, and to minimize bias in the related populations of fitted recession parameters. © 2017 Author(s).","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:11","2018-01-19 23:04:11","","65-81","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; United States; catchment; streamflow; regression analysis; sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Parameter estimation; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Probability distributions; Parameter distributions; California; Oregon; Stream flow; Mediterranean climates; Mediterranean environment; Model parameters; power law; Central tendencies; Correlative relationship; Fitting techniques; Impact-parameter; Recession analysis; uncertainty role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emerging technology of airborne topobathymetric light detection and ranging (lidar) is capable of providing both topographic and bathymetric elevation information, using only a single green laser, resulting in a seamless coverage of the land-water transition zone. However, there is no transparent and reproducible method for processing green topobathymetric lidar data into a digital elevation model (DEM). The general processing steps involve data filtering, water surface detection and refraction correction. Specifically, the procedure of water surface detection and modelling, solely using green laser lidar data, has not previously been described in detail for tidal environments. The aim of this study was to fill this gap of knowledge by developing a step-by-step procedure for making a digital water surface model (DWSM) using the green laser lidar data. The detailed description of the processing procedure augments its reliability, makes it user-friendly and repeatable. A DEM was obtained from the processed topobathymetric lidar data collected in spring 2014 from the Knudedyb tidal inlet system in the Danish Wadden Sea. The vertical accuracy of the lidar data is determined to ±8 cm at a 95 % confidence level, and the horizontal accuracy is determined as the mean error to ±10 cm. The lidar technique is found capable of detecting features with a size of less than 1 m2. The derived high-resolution DEM was applied for detection and classification of geomorphometric and morphological features within the natural environment of the study area. Initially, the bathymetric position index (BPI) and the slope of the DEM were used to make a continuous classification of the geomorphometry. Subsequently, stage (or elevation in relation to tidal range) and a combination of statistical neighbourhood analyses (moving average and standard deviation) with varying window sizes, combined with the DEM slope, were used to classify the study area into six specific types of morphological features (i.e. subtidal channel, intertidal flat, intertidal creek, linear bar, swash bar and beach dune). The developed classification method is adapted and applied to a specific case, but it can also be implemented in other cases and environments. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:13","2018-01-19 23:04:13","","43-63","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Denmark; performance assessment; Environmental conditions; data processing; Data handling; Forestry; Bathymetry; Classification (of information); digital elevation model; airborne sensing; Digital elevation model; lidar; Surveying; shallow water; Optical radar; Feature extraction; Light detection and ranging; Tides; geomorphological response; water depth; transition zone; intertidal environment; bathymetric survey; Classification methods; Morphological classifications; Morphological features; North Sea; Step by step procedure; tidal inlet; Tidal power; Wadden Sea; Water Surface Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we used environmental tracers (stable isotopes of water and electrical conductivity) to obtain new insight into the hydrology of glacierized catchments, using the Saldur River catchment, Italian Alps, as a pilot site. We analysed the controls on the spatial and temporal patterns of the tracer signature in the main stream, its selected tributaries, shallow groundwater, snowmelt and glacier melt over a 3-year period. We found that stream water electrical conductivity and isotopic composition showed consistent patterns in snowmelt-dominated periods, whereas the streamflow contribution of glacier melt altered the correlations between the two tracers. By applying two- and three-component mixing models, we quantified the seasonally variable proportion of groundwater, snowmelt and glacier melt at different locations along the stream. We provided four model scenarios based on different tracer signatures of the end-members; the highest contributions of snowmelt to streamflow occurred in late spring&ndash;early summer and ranged between 70 and 79%, according to different scenarios, whereas the largest inputs by glacier melt were observed in mid-summer, and ranged between 57 and 69%. In addition to the identification of the main sources of uncertainty, we demonstrated how a careful sampling design is critical in order to avoid underestimation of the meltwater component in streamflow. The results of this study supported the development of a conceptual model of streamflow response to meltwater dynamics in the Saldur catchment, which is likely valid for other glacierized catchments worldwide. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:16","2018-01-19 23:04:16","","23-41","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Runoff; catchment; streamflow; Rivers; Groundwater; runoff; hydrodynamics; conceptual framework; Catchments; Spatial and temporal patterns; Dynamics; Stream flow; Sources of uncertainty; Isotopes; tracer; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Shallow groundwater; isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Alps; Streamflow response; glacial hydrology; glacier dynamics; Electric conductivity; meltwater; Bolzano; Environmental tracers; Saldur Basin; Stable isotopes of water; Trentino-Alto Adige","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The presence of snow, rain, or mixed-phase precipitation affects the initial and boundary conditions that drive hydrological models. Despite their foundational importance to terrestrial hydrology, typical phase partitioning methods (PPMs) specify the phase based on near-surface air temperature only. Our review conveys the diversity of tools available for PPMs in hydrological modeling and the advancements needed to improve predictions in complex terrain with large spatiotemporal variations in precipitation phase. Initially, we review the processes and physics that control precipitation phase as relevant to hydrologists, focusing on the importance of processes occurring aloft. There is a wide range of options for field observations of precipitation phase, but there is a lack of a robust observation networks in complex terrain. New remote sensing observations have the potential to increase PPM fidelity, but generally require assumptions typical of other PPMs and field validation before they are operational. We review common PPMs and find that accuracy is generally increased at finer measurement intervals and by including humidity information. One important tool for PPM development is atmospheric modeling, which includes microphysical schemes that have not been effectively linked to hydrological models or validated against near-surface precipitation-phase observations. The review concludes by describing key research gaps and recommendations to improve PPMs, including better incorporation of atmospheric information, improved validation datasets, and regional-scale gridded data products. Two key points emerge from this synthesis for the hydrologic community: (1) current PPMs are too simple to capture important processes and are not well validated for most locations, (2) lack of sophisticated PPMs increases the uncertainty in estimation of hydrological sensitivity to changes in precipitation phase at local to regional scales. The advancement of PPMs is a critical research frontier in hydrology that requires scientific cooperation between hydrological and atmospheric modelers and field scientists. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:20","2018-01-19 23:04:20","","1-22","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Snow; prediction; rainfall; remote sensing; hydrological modeling; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; analytical method; Remote sensing; uncertainty analysis; model validation; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; complex terrain; Digital storage; Spatio-temporal variation; precipitation (climatology); Complex networks; hydrometeorology; boundary condition; air temperature; Atmospheric humidity; Initial and boundary conditions; Measurement interval; Mixed phase precipitation; Near surface air temperature; Near surface precipitation; Scientific cooperation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the previous decades, space agency efforts have brought forth well-known and immensely useful satellites such as the Landsat series and the Gravity Research and Climate Experiment (GRACE) system, with costs typically of the order of 1 billion dollars per satellite and with concept-to-launch timelines of the order of 2 decades (for new missions). More recently, the proliferation of smartphones has helped to miniaturize sensors and energy requirements, facilitating advances in the use of CubeSats that can be launched by the dozens, while providing ultra-high (3- 5 m) resolution sensing of the Earth on a daily basis. Startup companies that did not exist a decade ago now operate more satellites in orbit than any space agency, and at costs that are a mere fraction of traditional satellite missions. With these advances come new space-borne measurements, such as real-time high-definition video for tracking air pollution, storm-cell development, flood propagation, precipitation monitoring, or even for constructing digital surfaces using structure-from-motion techniques. Closer to the surface, measurements from small unmanned drones and tethered balloons have mapped snow depths, floods, and estimated evaporation at sub-metre resolutions, pushing back on spatio-temporal constraints and delivering new process insights. At ground level, precipitation has been measured using signal attenuation between antennae mounted on cell phone towers, while the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled citizen scientists to catalogue photos of environmental conditions, estimate daily average temperatures from battery state, and sense other hydrologically important variables such as channel depths using commercially available wireless devices. Global internet access is being pursued via highaltitude balloons, solar planes, and hundreds of planned satellite launches, providing a means to exploit the ""internet of things"" as an entirely new measurement domain. Such global access will enable real-time collection of data from billions of smartphones or from remote research platforms. This future will produce petabytes of data that can only be accessed via cloud storage and will require new analytical approaches to interpret. The extent to which today's hydrologic models can usefully ingest such massive data volumes is unclear. Nor is it clear whether this deluge of data will be usefully exploited, either because the measurements are superfluous, inconsistent, not accurate enough, or simply because we lack the capacity to process and analyse them. What is apparent is that the tools and techniques afforded by this array of novel and game-changing sensing platforms present our community with a unique opportunity to develop new insights that advance fundamental aspects of the hydrological sciences. To accomplish this will require more than just an application of the technology: in some cases, it will demand a radical rethink on how we utilize and exploit these new observing systems. © Author(s) 2017.","2017","2018-01-19 23:04:23","2018-01-19 23:04:23","","3879-3914","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","hydrology; GRACE; Environmental conditions; hydrological modeling; Floods; Satellites; sensor; Internet; Digital storage; precipitation (climatology); mobile communication; mobile phone; flood; Landsat; environmental conditions; Geodetic satellites; Observatories; Earth (planet); Orbits; Analytical approach; Balloons; High definition video; High-altitude balloons; Mobile telecommunication systems; Real-time collection; Smartphones; Space platforms; Spatio-temporal constraints; Structure from motion; Tools and techniques; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); unmanned vehicle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The flow calibration process was based on the Latin Hypercube Sampling of uncertain hydraulic parameters and the polynomial regression analysis of hundreds of transient flow simulations. The minimization of the objective function led to a good matching of computed and measured time series of state variables.

Moderate temperature rise (+3 °C) concurrent with rising CO2 concentration increased net photosynthesis of cohorts, but decreased biomass production because of increased maintenance respiration costs. However, an increase of 6 °C decreased both photosynthesis and biomass production, regardless of species optimal temperature. Increasing precipitation generally increased photosynthesis and biomass.

Conversely, Slope-Unit (SU) based susceptibility models allows to investigate the same areas offering two main advantages: 1) a smaller computational burden and 2) a more geomorphologically-oriented interpretation. In this contribution, we generate SU-based landslide susceptibility for the Sado Island in Japan. This island is characterized by deep-seated landslides which we assume can only limitedly be explained by the first two statistical moments (mean and variance) of a set of predictors within each slope unit. As a consequence, in a nested experiment, we first analyse the distributions of a set of continuous predictors within each slope unit computing the standard deviation and quantiles from 0.05 to 0.95 with a step of 0.05. These are then used as predictors for landslide susceptibility. In addition, we combine shape indices for polygon features and the normalized extent of each class belonging to the outcropping lithology in a given SU. This procedure significantly enlarges the size of the predictor hyperspace, thus producing a high level of slope-unit characterization. In a second step, we adopt a LASSO-penalized Generalized Linear Model to shrink back the predictor set to a sensible and interpretable number, carrying only the most significant covariates in the models. As a result, we are able to document the geomorphic features (e.g., 95% quantile of Elevation and 5% quantile of Plan Curvature) that primarily control the SU-based susceptibility within the test area while producing high predictive performances. The implementation of the statistical analyses are included in a parallelized R script (LUDARA) which is here made available for the community to replicate analogous experiments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:34:13","2018-01-19 22:34:13","","145-156","","","97","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the model is nonlinear and input variables are spatially averaged, the regional mean will be in error. A formula for estimating the upscaling error can be derived from Taylor expansion of the model (Bresler and Dagan 1988). We test this for simple models under three different input distributions (Gaussian, exponential, lognormal). In several cases the formula is exact, in others it provides a reasonable approximation. We then study models for emissions of methane, ammonia, and nitrous oxide across the UK. We scale from 1 × 1 km to 32 × 32 km. The UK-average upscaling errors are −12%, −48% and −3%, well estimated using the formula. The formula is a useful tool for modellers desiring to correct upscaling error for their application.

A multi-scale analysis is carried out and it is found that while domain-and-time averaged fluxes and state variables are not sensitive to land-surface heterogeneity, atmospheric patterns are. Close to the surface, atmospheric patterns are dominated by land-surface forced patterns; away from the surface, “eigen” patterns dominate and forced patterns reemerge for large averaging times.

It suggests that individual models should expose necessary interfaces for provenance capturing in IEM environments. The provenance is represented using the W3C PROV model for interoperability.

We discuss that perturbation scale is inherent to any (local and global) SA approach, and explain how derivative-based SA approaches (e.g., method of Morris) focus on small-scale perturbations, while variance-based approaches (e.g., method of Sobol) focus on large-scale perturbations. We employ a novel variogram-based approach, called Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS), which bridges derivative- and variance-based approaches. Our analyses with different real-world environmental models demonstrate significant implications of subjectivity in the perturbation-scale choice and the need for strategies to address these implications. It is further shown how VARS can uniquely characterize the perturbation-scale dependency and generate sensitivity measures that encompass all sensitivity-related information across the full spectrum of perturbation scales. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:34:59","2018-01-19 22:34:59","","115-131","","","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; groundwater; sensitivity analysis; Computer software; software; Ecology; environmental modeling; Hydrogeosphere; hydrological modeling; Environmental modelling; finite element method; interdisciplinary approach; MESH; perturbation; Perturbation scale; soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; VARS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the WNTR modeling framework is presented and a case study is described that uses WNTR to simulate the effects of an earthquake on a water distribution system. The case study illustrates that the severity of damage is not only a function of system integrity and earthquake magnitude, but also of the available resources and repair strategies used to return the system to normal operating conditions.

This paper describes the design of an integrated transportation and air quality modelling framework capable of simulating traffic emissions and air pollution at a refined spatio-temporal scale. For this purpose, emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) were estimated in the Greater Montreal Region at the level of individual trips and vehicles. In turn, hourly Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations were simulated across different seasons and validated against observations. Our validation results reveal a reasonable performance of the modelling chain. The modelling system was used to evaluate the impact of an extensive regional transit improvement strategy revealing reductions in NO2concentrations across the territory by about 3.6% compared to the base case in addition to a decrease in the frequency and severity of NO2hot spots. This is associated with a reduction in total NOxemissions of 1.9% compared to the base case; some roads experienced reductions by more than half. Finally, a methodology for assessing individuals’ daily exposure is developed (by tracking activity locations and trajectories) and we observed a reduction of 20.8% in daily exposures compared to the base case. The large difference between reductions in the mean NO2concentration across the study domain and the mean NO2exposure across the sample population results from the fact that NO2concentrations dropped largely in the areas which attract the most individuals. This exercise illustrates that evaluating the air quality impacts of transportation scenarios by solely quantifying reductions in air pollution concentrations across the study domain would lead to an underestimation of the potential health gains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:35:27","2018-01-19 22:35:27","","186-198","","","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","software; environmental modeling; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; Pollution; concentration (composition); air quality; Air quality; CALMET; Calpuff; Canada; Crashworthiness; dispersion; Dispersion Modelling; Investments; Montreal; nitrogen dioxide; Nitrogen dioxides; Nitrogen oxides; policy approach; Policy scenario; pollution exposure; Public transit; public transport; Quebec [Canada]; Reduction; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; traffic emission; Traffic emissions; Transportation; transportation policy; Urban transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a literature review with the aim of improving our understanding of model integration process, and also presenting better strategies for building integrated modeling systems. We identified five different phases to characterize integration process: pre-integration assessment, preparation of models for integration, orchestration of models during simulation, data interoperability, and testing. Commonly, there is little reuse of existing frameworks beyond the development teams and not much sharing of science components across frameworks.

In contrast to ABM, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping takes a macro-level view of the world that represents causal connections between concepts rather than individual entities. Researchers have expressed interest in reconciling the two, i.e. taking a hybrid approach and drawing of the strengths of each to more accurately model socio-ecological interactions. The intuition is to take FCMs, which can be quickly developed using participatory modeling tools and use them to create a virtual population of agents with sophisticated decision-making processes.

These results highlight the importance of accurate knowledge of the values of these variables when calculating the risk of wind damage with ForestGALES. Conversely, rooting depth and soil type, i.e. the model input variables on which the empirical component of ForestGALES that describes the resistance to overturning is based, contribute only marginally to the variation in the outputs.

Unlike Latin hypercube sampling, PLHS generates a series of smaller sub-sets (slices) such that (1) the first slice is Latin hypercube, (2) the progressive union of slices remains Latin hypercube and achieves maximum stratification in any one-dimensional projection, and as such (3) the entire sample set is Latin hypercube.

The goal of this study was to develop a multi-scale modeling platform for drainage infrastructure resilience assessment in a coastal watershed. The model employs scale-dependent informatics, including hydroinformatics, climate informatics, and geoinformatics, to support a comprehensive hydrodynamic stormwater and hydrologic model, called the Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing Model. Low Impact Development (LID), deemed as green drainage infrastructure, was adopted and assessed in the Cross Bayou Watershed, Florida. The Cross Bayou Canal is the grey infrastructure, which dissects the watershed and connects both Tampa Bay and Boca Ciega Bay on its northeastern and southwestern ends, respectively. Modeling scenarios are driven by watershed-scale rainfall/runoff, coastal high tide, and global sea level rise, respectively or collectively, to evaluate the green-grey drainage infrastructure system in response to current and future coastal flood hazards predicted for year 2030. The quantitative resilience metrics, such as peak inflow reduction at flood zone, were chosen to reflect storms that pose threats to the watershed, now and in the future year 2030, for climate change scenarios derived by the Statistical Downscaling Model. Results indicate that the effectiveness of LID depends on the rainfall type being considered, such as convective storm versus frontal rain, and sub-daily rainfall patterns, as well as a groundwater table analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:36:06","2018-01-19 22:36:06","","1-26","","","90","","Environmental Modelling and Software","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; United States; Watershed modeling; downscaling; sustainability; climate change; water management; hydrological modeling; Floods; environmental assessment; Climate models; Groundwater; runoff; watershed; Watersheds; hydrodynamics; flood damage; Coastal sustainability; Drainage infrastructure; drainage network; Florida [United States]; global climate; informatics; Information science; infrastructure; Precipitation (meteorology); Resilience assessment; Sea level; sea level change; Sea level rise; Storm-water managements; Storms; Tampa Bay; urban drainage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A large proportion of the world fish stocks are, however, getting fully or over-exploited. In this article we address these issues in the context of the small-scale fisheries of the Solomon Islands. The paper explores the extent to which in-shore Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) can help increasing the resilience of the small scale fishery system and reconciling social, economic and ecological priorities. Based on the concept of ‘time of crisis’ developed recently in the viability literature, we propose to calculate a resilience index through a dynamic stochastic model calibrated by ethnological observations. The resilience index calculation reveals two major findings: (i) the resilience of the small scale fishery system is currently nonexistent and (ii) the introduction of FADs can improve it. The effects of the FADs' implementation are then discussed in the light of a socio-economic perspective. Such results bring new insights into the question of the future of the small scale fishery sector, especially in relation to the local economy evolution from a barter dominance to a cash oriented economy. At the same time, the current subsistence fisheries seems more resilient in general due to a distributive effects which ease the ‘race for fish behaviors’. Finally, our analysis reveals that while the FADs implementation stands as a short and mid-term answer, demographic drivers are important and other alternatives will need to be considered if the overall viability of the system is to be maintained in the longer-term. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:36:09","2018-01-19 22:36:09","","291-304","","","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Fish; environmental planning; Food supply; innovation; Economics; ecosystem modeling; Resilience; calibration; Data-poor situation; ecosystem resilience; Environmental development; ethnography; fish aggregating device; Fisheries; fishery; food security; local economy; pelagic ecosystem; poverty alleviation; small scale industry; Small-scale fisheries; Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; stock assessment; Technological innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, GP evolves alternative models of different accuracy and complexity, where selecting a parsimonious model from such alternatives needs extra attention. To cope with these problems, this paper proposes a new hybrid model that integrates moving average filtering with multigene GP and uses Pareto-front plot to optimize the evolved models through an interactive complexity-efficiency trade-off. The model was applied to develop single- and multi-day-ahead rainfall-runoff models and compared to stand-alone GP, multigene GP, and multilayer perceptron as the benchmarks.

As proofs of concept, (i) the components are coupled with two crop simulators to reproduce wheat brown rust and rice blast epidemics and their impacts on leaf area and yield formation; (ii) spatially distributed sensitivity analyses are performed for rice in China and wheat in Europe to investigate model behaviour; (iii) a preliminary evaluation against observations of rice blast severity is performed in Northern Italy. The components are explicitly targeted to the modelling of crop-pathogen interactions to perform scenario analysis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2017","2018-01-19 22:36:41","2018-01-19 22:36:41","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; Computer software; Crops; Cultivation; Alternate approaches; Epidemic development; Epidemiology; Pathogen interaction; Pathogens; Physiological models; Physiological process; Plant pathogen interaction; Plants (botany); Predictive capabilities; Scenario analysis; Yield loss","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper evaluates the influence of applying different downscaling methods of increasing complexity (annual scaling, monthly scaling, quantile scaling, and weather generator method) on the assessment of ecological outcomes. In addition to time-averaged indicators, “sequence-dependent” metrics which involve ecological dynamics by considering the impacts of flow sequencing are also adopted. In a case study in Australia, the condition of river red gum forest was assessed. Results show that the choice of downscaling methods can be of similar importance as that of GCMs in ecological impact studies.

In particular, a new interface to the model is presented, so-called “SimSphere-SOA” which forms a command line land biosphere tool, a Web Service interface and a parameters verification facade that offers a standardised environment for specification execution and result retrieval of a typical model simulation based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). SimSphere-SOA library can now execute various simulations in parallel. This allows exploitation of the tool in a simple and efficient way in comparison to the currently distributed approach. In SimSphere-SOA, an Application Programming Interface (API) is also provided to execute simulations that can be publicly consumed. Finally this API is exported as a Web Service for remotely executing simulations through web based tools. This way a simulation by the model can be executed efficiently and subsequently the model simulation outputs may be used in any kind of relevant analysis required. The use of these new functionalities offered by SimSphere-SOA is also demonstrated using a “real world” simulation configuration file.

To capture the water-air interface, a novel volume of fluid (VOF) formulation is implemented using the ghost fluid method with one-side extrapolation for dynamic pressure. Equations for fluid flow and free surface motion are decoupled due to separation of time scales. Accordingly, time step size can be increased by a factor of 3-orders of magnitude and still preserve numerical stability and computational efficiency. A novel finite area method (FAM) is utilized to discretize Exner equation on irregular bed surface providing a 3D finite volume-like discretization on curved surfaces. The evolution of the water-sediment interface is captured by a novel vertex-based unstructured mesh dynamic motion solve using Laplace operator with variable diffusivity. The code is implemented in foam-extend and tested against two classical experiments. Good results are obtained with correct trends and lower absolute error compared to previous mobile bed models. This shows that the developed code has a good potential of being applied to mobile-bed hydraulic real problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:37:11","2018-01-19 22:37:11","","303-317","","","97","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sediments; numerical model; three-dimensional modeling; Computational efficiency; 3-D numerical modeling; Air; Bridge piers; Codes (symbols); Computational fluid dynamics; deformation mechanism; finite volume method; Flow of fluids; free surface flow; Free-surface flow; Mesh generation; Mesh motion; Mobile bed; OpenFOAM; Phase interfaces; pier; river bed; River bend; scour; Scour; sediment-water interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to speed, it is desirable for the SRR also to be spatially flexible (application over a wide range of situations) and to require a “light setup” (based on a limited number of full Air Quality Models - AQM simulations). But “speed”, “flexibility” and “light setup” do not naturally come together and a good compromise must be ensured that preserves “accuracy”, i.e. a good comparability between SRR results and AQM. In this work we further develop a SRR methodology to better capture spatial flexibility. The updated methodology is based on a cell-to-cell relationship, in which a bell-shape function links emissions to concentrations. Maintaining a cell-to-cell relationship is shown to be the key element needed to ensure spatial flexibility, while at the same time the proposed approach to link emissions and concentrations guarantees a “light set-up” phase. Validation has been repeated on different areas and domain sizes (countries, regions, province throughout Europe) for precursors reduced independently or contemporarily. All runs showed a bias around 10% between the full AQM and the SRR. This methodology allows assessing the impact on air quality of emission scenarios applied over any given area in Europe (regions, set of regions, countries), provided that a limited number of AQM simulations are performed for training. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-19 22:37:14","2018-01-19 22:37:14","","68-77","","","90","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Europe; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); integrated approach; Integrated assessment; air quality; Air quality; spatial variation; Air quality modeling; Air quality models; Cells; Cytology; emission inventory; Emission scenario; Integrated assessment models; qualitative analysis; Shape functions; Source-receptor relationships; source-sink dynamics; surrogate method; Surrogate model; training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes a new method of model coupling which addresses this problem through a dynamic form of regularization. The method allows the time series evolution of model variables to be mutually informed by multiple models, and models to influence each other in proportion to their degree of certainty. Uncoupled forms of the coupled models can act as dynamic priors on the trajectory of coupled variables, strengthening model stability and offering additional calibration of the coupling process. Finally, models that describe different spatial scales can be coupled into multi-scale models, so that, for example, spatially-distributed models can be coupled with aggregate models, and influence one another.

To simplify this process and avoid human errors, we have developed an automatic model created with Model Builder™ ArcGIS software.

Traditional approaches such as MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) are prohibitive to be applied to large complex dynamic models because of the high computational cost of computing resources. To reduce the number of model evaluations required, we proposed an adaptive surrogate modeling-based sampling strategy for parameter distribution estimation, named ASMO-PODE (Adaptive Surrogate Modeling-based Optimization – Parameter Optimization and Distribution Estimation). The ASMO-PODE can provide an estimation of the parameter distribution using as little as one percent of the model evaluations required by a regular MCMC approach. The effectiveness and efficiency of the ASMO-PODE approach have been evaluated with 2 test problems and one land surface model, the Common Land Model.

Predictive modelling of this partitioning is challenging, particularly under variable hydrodynamic conditions in rivers. This paper presents a coupled hydrodynamic–geochemical model for trace metal dynamics in rivers, to highlight key parameters and set a basis for developing simplified models. A coupled model based on the hydrodynamic model MOHID and the chemical speciation model WHAM was applied to the middle part of the Garonne River (SW-France). The predictions of the coupled model are compared to those of a fixed Kd partitioning model. The model accurately simulates trace metal behaviour under varying hydrological conditions. The importance of the riverbed geomorphology and the diurnal variations in pH on TM concentrations in the water column are underlined.

We simulated single disturbances with different spatiotemporal characteristics and monitored subsequent recovery of the biodegradation dynamics. After less intense disturbance events local regrowth governs biodegradation recovery. After highly intense disturbance events the disturbance pattern's spatial configuration is decisive and processes governing local functional recovery vary depending on habitat location with respect to the spatial disturbance pattern.

Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are often used for hazard modeling but require long records to describe the distribution of rainfall depth and duration and do not provide information regarding rainfall space-time structure, limiting their usefulness to small scales. In contrast, RainyDay can be used for many hazard applications with 1–2 decades of data, and output rainfall scenarios incorporate detailed space-time structure from remote sensing.

These contributions highlight that further advances in this research field are required, especially from highly polluted regions, as so far papers from these regions are scarce. The majority of contributions covers exposure to ambient air pollution, which is a key public health risk in both industrialised and developing countries.

Procedures are described for automated removal of the acoustic shadows, identification of bed-water interface for situations when the water is too turbid or turbulent for reliable depth echosounding, and for automated bed substrate classification based on singlebeam full-waveform analysis.

The procedure uses a hydrodynamic model as basis for sewer network data to create the model layout. A standardised series of composite rainfall events is applied to the hydrodynamic model in order to obtain the necessary reference data for the automated calibration of the conceptual model.

Results show the crucial role of human behavior in driving the interactions between these coupled systems.

We find that the level of spatial aggregation influences the magnitude but not the direction of land use change in response to the modeled drivers, and in the examples analyzed, increasing spatial resolution reduces the extent of land use change. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2017","2018-01-19 22:39:43","2018-01-19 22:39:43","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate models; Land use; Agriculture; Climate change mitigation; Data handling; Integrated assessment; Multivariant analysis; Spatial heterogeneity; Economic components; Image resolution; Land productivities; Multivariate statistics; Non-metric multidimensional scaling; Spatial aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model replication remains rare, yet is vital to assessing the repeatability of existing agent based models. Notably, more work is needed to assess cross platform and language replication, which represent potential sources of variability between model results. An existing, complex agent based model was replicated using two widely used platforms (NetLogo and Repast). When results generated by the models were compared, the findings differed not only in magnitude but the trends produced by the data, resulting in different conclusions being drawn from each set of model predictions. The variation between the models is believed to be a result of the complexity of encoding a substantial theoretical model in particular programming languages.

Several pGTIOL-based data I/O functions and options were added to pRPL, while the existing functions of pRPL stay intact. Experiments showed that the integration of pRPL and pGTIOL achieved higher performance than the original pRPL that uses GDAL as the I/O interface.

Bushfire related studies and current operational activities have a common challenge in quantifying fuels, since the fuel load varies across the landscape. This paper developed a predictive model that efficiently and accurately estimates quantities of surface fuel in Australian southeast Eucalypt forests. Model coefficients were determined through a three-step process that attempts to evaluate how the spatial variation in surface fuel load relates to litter-bed depth, fuel characteristics, topography and previous fire disturbance. First, the forest surface fuel depth-to-load relationship was established; second, key quantitative variables of environmental factors were added; and third, important qualitative variables of fuel characteristics were included. The verification of model prediction was conducted through leave-one-out cross-validation (CV). Light Detection and Ranging was used to quantify forest structural characteristics and terrain features. The calibrated model had a R2 of 0.89 (RMSE = 20.7 g) and performed better than the currently used surface fuel load models, including McArthur's (R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 39.6 g) and Gilroy and Tran's (R2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 36.5 g) models. This study describes a novel approach to forest surface fuel load modelling using forest characteristics and environmental factors derived from LiDAR data through statistical analysis. The model established in this study can be used as an efficient approach to assist in forest fuel management and fire related operational activities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:40:00","2018-01-19 22:40:00","","61-71","","","97","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Fuels; Risk assessment; satellite data; multiple regression; Statistical methods; environmental factor; numerical model; Hazards; Forestry; spatial variation; disturbance; Fires; forest ecosystem; forest management; Airborne LiDAR; lidar; bushfire; Fire hazards; Fuel gages; Litter-bed fuel depth; Multiple regressions; Optical radar; Surface fuels; Terrestrial lidars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conservation areas that protect habitat quality and ecosystem services were simulated using the Zonation software with three scenarios of ecosystem service distribution.

To handle such uncertainties, robustness can be used to assess system performance, but its calculation typically involves many scenarios and hence is computationally expensive. Consequently, robustness has usually not been included as a formal optimization objective, but is considered post-optimization. To address this shortcoming, an approach is developed that uses metamodels (surrogates of computationally expensive simulation models) to calculate robustness and other objectives. This enables robustness to be considered explicitly as an objective within a multi-objective optimization framework. The approach is demonstrated for a water-supply sources sequencing problem in Adelaide, South Australia.

Soft strategies such as land cover change are used to mitigate damages due to flooding. In this approach one chooses the best combination of land covers such that flood damage and the investment costs are minimized. Because of the uncertain nature of the problem, former studies addressed this problem by stochastic programming models which are found to be computationally expensive. In this work, a novel non-probabilistic robust counterpart approach is proposed in which the uncertainty of the rainfall events requires a new formulation and solution algorithms. Non-probabilistic methods, developed in the field of robust optimization were shown to have advantages over classical stochastic methods in several aspects such as: tractability, non-necessity of full probabilistic information, and the ability to integrate correlation of uncertain variables without adding complexity. However, unlike former studies in the field of robust optimization, the resulting optimization model in the flood risk management problem is nonlinear and discontinuous and leads to an intractable robust counterpart model. In this work, a novel iterative linearization scheme is proposed to effectively solve nonlinear robust counterpart models. This work demonstrates the tractability and applicability of non-probabilistic robust optimization to nonlinear problems similar to the flood risk management problem. The results show considerable promise of the robust counterpart approach in terms of showing the tradeoff between flood risk and cost in an efficient manner. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:40:46","2018-01-19 22:40:46","","48-60","","","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; Water resources management; algorithm; optimization; rainfall; land cover; Stochastic programming; Risk management; Optimization; design method; Floods; flooding; Flood control; water resource; numerical model; floodplain; flood control; flood damage; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Optimization modeling; Solution algorithms; control system; Flood risk management; Iterative linearizations; Iterative methods; Non-probabilistic methods; Probabilistic information; Stochastic programming model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Both uptake models were implemented through the field-scale Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM5), which includes an update for adjusting runoff uptake parameters.

Traditional MORDM first optimized a problem under a baseline scenario, then evaluated candidate solutions under an ensemble of uncertain conditions, and finally discovered scenarios under which solutions are vulnerable. In this analysis, we perform multiple multi-objective search trials that directly incorporate these discovered scenarios within the search. Through the analysis, we have created multiple problem formulations to show how methodological choices of severe scenarios affect the resulting candidate planning solutions.

Simulating from such data involves generating random variables from some fitted probability distribution, preserving the main statistical characteristics. The particular case of data simulation with moment matching is revisited, with a proposal that data be simulated from many-component finite mixture distributions. The simulation procedure matches data moments while also giving greater flexibility for data approximation. In contrast, a single parametric distribution fitted to irregular data will result in data simulations more representative of the fitted distribution than the original data. The flexible finite mixture approach therefore has potential to replace parametric univariate data simulation generally.

Bayesian inference can jointly address these issues. However, due to high computational requirements of these models and technical difficulties in applying Bayesian inference to stochastic models, the exploration of its application to ABMs/IBMs has just started. We demonstrate the feasibility of Bayesian inference for ABMs/IBMs with a Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) algorithm developed for state-space models. The algorithm profits from the model's hidden Markov structure by jointly estimating system states and the marginal likelihood of the parameters using time-series observations. The PMCMC algorithm performed well when tested on a simple predator-prey IBM using artificial observation data. Hence, it offers the possibility for Bayesian inference for ABMs/IBMs. This can yield additional insights into model behaviour and uncertainty and extend the usefulness of ABMs/IBMs in ecological and environmental research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:42:21","2018-01-19 22:42:21","","110-119","","","87","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Markov chain; algorithm; parameter estimation; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; Ecology; Monte Carlo analysis; Parameter estimation; Inference engines; numerical model; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; calibration; uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; ecological approach; Chains; Markov processes; Individual based model; individual-based model; Approximate Bayesian; Bayesian inference; behavior; exploration; Particle markov chain monte carlo; predator-prey interaction; State space methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the main goal is to predict if the monsoon will be an extreme monsoon for a temporal horizon of a month. Firstly, a new monthly index of the monsoon related to its intensity has been generated. Later, the problem of forecasting has been transformed into a binary imbalanced classification problem and a set of representative techniques, such as models based on trees, models based on rules, black box models and ensemble techniques, are applied to obtain the forecasts.

To quantify N2O emissions from agroecosystems, which occur as a result of nitrogen (N) cycling, a new physically-based routine was developed for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to predict N2O flux during denitrification and an existing nitrification routine was modified to capture N2O flux during this process. The new routines predict N2O emissions by coupling the carbon (C) and N cycles with soil moisture/temperature and pH in SWAT. The model uses reduction functions to predict total denitrification (N2+ N2O) and partitions N2from N2O using a ratio method. The modified SWAT nitrification routine likewise predicts N2O emissions using reduction functions. The new denitrification routine and modified nitrification routine were tested using GRACEnet data at University Park, Pennsylvania, and West Lafayette, Indiana. Results showed strong correlations between plot measurements of N2O flux and the model predictions for both test sites and suggest that N2O emissions are particularly sensitive to soil pH and soil N, and moderately sensitive to soil temperature/moisture and total soil C levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:42:48","2018-01-19 22:42:48","","131-143","","","89","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; greenhouse gas; soil moisture; Forecasting; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Spatial distribution; Soil and water assessment tool; Nitrogen oxides; spatial distribution; Soil moisture; Soils; Model prediction; nitrogen cycle; soil carbon; pH; Soil surveys; soil temperature; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural emission; carbon cycle; denitrification; Denitrification; Indiana; nitrification; Nitrification; nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide; Pennsylvania; Reduction function; Soil carbon; Soil temperature; Strong correlation; West Lafayette","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conventional rank histogram provided a simple evaluation of the reliability of an ensemble forecast, which could not differentiate the reliability of the forecasts of extreme events such as heavy storms, high flows and low flows.

Our review of currently existing WSUD-PSS shows that WSUD is approached from three perspectives: hydrological, urban planning and water governance. As a form of best (urban) planning practice, WSUD requires PSS that regard these technologies as an integral part of the urban form. We argue that suitability of location for WSUD has two sides: ‘WSUD needs a place’ and ‘a place needs WSUD’. No framework or PSS exists that frames WSUD from both sides of suitability. We propose such a suitability framework, building on evidence from literature. Our review found no comprehensive tool or strategy incorporating all relevant factors for suitability analysis. Our proposed framework addresses this gap, and serves as the basis for rigorous WSUD-PSS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:43:31","2018-01-19 22:43:31","","265-282","","","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","GIS; sustainability; Ecosystem services; Ecosystems; wastewater treatment; ecosystem service; farming system; Low impact development; urban planning; Urban planning; stormwater; Water sensitive urban design (WSUD); governance approach; Planning support systems; planning system; spatial planning; Stormwater treatment; Suitability analysis; Sustainable urban drainage systems; urban design; Water sensitive urban designs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SOMersault method is an expansion of the SOM, effective for gaining an understanding of patterns and clusters in natural data sets containing a low dimensional nonlinear manifold set amongst complex high dimensional data measurements. Data clusters become ordered with respect to the nonlinear degrees of freedom in the data, and patterns extracted are closely related to the data they represent.

The present study is a contribution to a regional-scale analysis of the C and water cycles on managed grasslands. The mechanistic biogeochemical model PaSim (Pasture Simulation model) was evaluated at 12 grassland sites in Europe. A new parameterization was obtained on a common set of eco-physiological parameters, which represented an improvement of previous parameterization schemes (essentially obtained via calibration at specific sites). We found that C and water fluxes estimated with the parameter set are in good agreement with observations. The model with the new parameters estimated that European grassland are a sink of C with 213gCm-2yr-1, which is close to the observed net ecosystem exchange (NEE) flux of the studied sites (185gCm-2yr-1 on average). The estimated yearly average gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RECO) for all of the study sites are 1220 and 1006gCm-2yr-1, respectively, in agreement with observed average GPP (1230gCm-2yr-1) and RECO (1046gCm-2yr-1). For both variables aggregated on a weekly basis, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 5-16gCweek-1 across the study sites, while the goodness of fit (R2) was 0.4-0.9. For evapotranspiration (ET), the average value of simulated ET (415mmyr-1) for all sites and years is close to the average value of the observed ET (451mmyr-1) by flux towers (on a weekly basis, RMSE 2-8mmweek-1; R2=0.3-0.9). However, further model development is needed to better represent soil water dynamics under dry conditions and soil temperature in winter. A quantification of the uncertainties introduced by spatially generalized parameter values in C and water exchange estimates is also necessary. In addition, some uncertainties in the input management data call for the need to improve the quality of the observational system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2017","2018-01-19 22:43:36","2018-01-19 22:43:36","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Statistics; Water balance; Uncertainty analysis; Ecology; Parameter estimation; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Information management; Model evaluation; Soil moisture; Digital storage; Carbon; Physiological models; Mean square error; Simulation model; Carbon fluxes; Eddy fluxes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model converts sediment samples to a mass in transit for each instantaneous discharge according to impacts detected and a Monte Carlo simulation of the load determined at random from the particle size distribution. Using impact count data autogenically produces a supply-limited, location-specific and high-resolution time-series of bedload rates, while the probabilistic approach inherently accommodates the stochastic nature of bedload transport. Application to the River Avon (Devon, U.K.) provides cross-sectional bedload rate estimates within the bounds of experimental data and calibrated to observed field behaviour.

A fuzzy linear regression is formulated between the values of eight factors and corresponding nitrate concentration in groundwater. An optimization model based on real code genetic algorithm with objective of minimizing the sum of the fuzzy spread of the regression coefficients is implemented.

However, previous studies generally treated the background of forest canopy as soil surface while ignored the fact that the soil may be covered by grass canopy. In this study, we focused on retrieving FMC of such forestry structure by coupling two RTMs: PROSAIL and PRO-GeoSail. The spectra of lower grass canopy were firstly simulated by the PROSAIL model, which was then coupled into the PRO-GeoSail model. The results showed that the accuracy level of retrieved FMC using this coupled model was better than that when the PRO-GeoSail model used alone.

We develop K-nearest neighbor based stochastic simulation methods for daily streamflow and attendant stream temperature at five streams that drain into Lake Shasta. The methods can also generate scenarios conditioned on the larger climate – e.g., extreme wet or extreme dry. The ability of the methods to capture the historical variability of flow and temperature for Lake Shasta is demonstrated.

Most research on riparian zones have been implemented at small scales. Direct measurement at large scale is infeasible, thus using models is a good alternative. This study introduces a modified SWAT model, referred as SWAT_LS. Two modifications were implemented: (i) adding hydrological routing from upland areas to riparian zones; and (ii) adding a module to simulate denitrification in riparian zones based on the Riparian Nitrogen Model. SWAT_LS was applied to the Odense river basin in Denmark, a densely tile-drained agricultural river basin. Compared to SWAT, SWAT_LS provides an equally good performance for streamflow, and a significant improvement in nitrate predictions. SWAT_LS predicts that current riparian zones remove only 4–17% of nitrate loads because 70% of the riparian areas are bypassed due to subsurface drainage implementation. This ability would dramatically increase to 25–85% if riparian zones are entirely undrained. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2018-01-19 22:43:49","2018-01-19 22:43:49","","163-179","","","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Denmark; performance assessment; streamflow; Rivers; Groundwater flow; nitrate; soil and water assessment tool; Watersheds; Soil and Water assessment tools; river basin; Soil moisture; Nitrates; pollutant removal; riparian zone; Riparian zones; Fyn; Odense Basin; Syddanmark; River basins; denitrification; Denitrification; Landscape routing; Soil water interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

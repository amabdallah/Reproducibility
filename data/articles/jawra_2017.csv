Examining a case study of Cougar Dam in Oregon, United States, we simulated current reservoir operations under scenarios of plausible future hydrology. Streamflow projections from the CGCM3.1 general circulation model for the A1B emission scenario were used to generate stochastic reservoir inflows that were then further perturbed to simulate a potentially drier future. These were then used to drive a simple reservoir model. In the scenario-based analysis, we found reservoir operations are vulnerable to climate change. Increases in fall and winter inflow could lead to more frequent flood storage, reducing flexibility to store incoming flood flows. Uncertainty in spring inflow volume complicates projection of future filling performance. The reservoir may fill more or less often, depending on whether springs are wetter or drier. In the summer, drawdown may occur earlier to meet conservation objectives. From the scenario-neutral analysis, we identified thresholds of streamflow magnitude that can predict climate change impacts for a wide range of scenarios. Our results highlight projected operational challenges for Cougar Dam and provide an example of how scenario-based and scenario-neutral approaches may be applied concurrently to assess climate change impacts. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:05","2018-01-19 22:46:05","","1467-1482","","6","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Dams; United States; Water resources; Water resources management; performance assessment; reservoir; streamflow; water management; Floods; Climate models; water resource; scenario analysis; uncertainty analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; river basin; Water levels; environmental impact assessment; stochasticity; Oregon; Reservoirs (water); River basins; Stream flow; inflow; general circulation model; General circulation model; Climate variability/change; dam; Impacts assessment; Multipurpose reservoirs; Operational performance; Scenario-based analysis; Willamette Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to investigate how natural gas development could impact streamflow and sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loadings in the upper Delaware River Basin (DRB), a relatively undeveloped watershed of 7,950 km2 that lies above the Marcellus Shale formation. If gas development was permitted, our projections show the DRB could experience development of over 600 well pads to extract natural gas at build out, which, with supporting infrastructure (roads, gathering pipelines), could convert over 5,000 ha from existing land uses in the study area. In subbasins with development activity we found sediment, TN, and TP yields could increase by an average of 15, 0.08, and 0.03 kg/ha/yr, respectively (an increase of 2, 3, and 15%, respectively) for each one percent of subbasin land area converted into natural gas infrastructure. At the study area outlet on the Delaware River at Port Jervis, New York, we found increases in the annual average streamflow and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads of up to 0.01, 0.2, 0.2, and 1%, respectively, for a rapid development year, and 0.08, 1.3, 2.0, and 11%, respectively, for the full development scenario.

We build on emerging research exploring the efficacy of occupational identity by investigating a potentially important difference among rural landholders that, to our knowledge, remains untested: irrigated operations and dryland operations. Using primary data collected from a large sample of operators in the North Central region of Victoria, Australia, we compared irrigators with dryland operators across a range of characteristics, controlling for the influence of occupational identity. We find evidence that irrigators tend to hold a stronger business orientation toward their properties and that dryland operators tend to hold stronger environmental concerns. But, it is important not to overdraw contrasts on business-environment tradeoffs. Both place value on financial aspects of their properties and both hold environmental concerns. But, the especially close coupling of life and work among irrigators encourage a stronger orientation toward farming, and the natural resource base, as a means of sustaining livelihoods.

We evaluated the importance of current groundwater levels, precipitation, streamflow, seasonal variability, Palmer Drought Severity Index, and atmosphere/ocean indices for developing the logistic regression equations. Several diagnostics of model fit were used to evaluate the regression equations, including testing of autocorrelation of residuals, goodness-of-fit metrics, and bootstrap validation testing. The probabilistic predictions were most successful at wells with high persistence (low month-to-month variability) in their groundwater records and at wells where the groundwater level remained below the defined low threshold for sustained periods (generally three months or longer). The model fit was weakest at wells with strong seasonal variability in levels and with shorter duration low-threshold events.

In previous studies, several soil moisture indices (e.g., the soil moisture index, soil water deficit index) based on soil water availability have been developed for agricultural drought monitoring. However, when developing these indices, it was generally assumed that soil water availability to crops was equal throughout the root zone, and the effects of root distribution and crop growth stage on soil water uptake were ignored. This article aims to incorporate root distribution into a soil moisture-based index and to evaluate the performance of the improved soil moisture index for agricultural drought monitoring. The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China was used as the study area. Overall, soil moisture indices were significantly correlated with the crop moisture index (CMI), and the improved root-weighted soil moisture index (RSMI) was more closely related to the CMI than averaged soil moisture indices. The RSMI correctly identified most of the observed drought events and performed well in the detection of drought levels. Furthermore, the RSMI had a better performance than averaged soil moisture indices when compared to crop yield. In conclusion, soil moisture indices could improve agricultural drought monitoring by incorporating root distribution. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:12","2018-01-19 22:46:12","","1409-1423","","6","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; drought; performance assessment; soil moisture; Drought; Agriculture; Crops; Forestry; crop yield; irrigation system; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Plants (botany); Crop growth model; growth modeling; Monitoring; monitoring; Water use; Moisture; water uptake; Agricultural drought; rhizosphere; Moisture index; North China Plain; Root distribution; Soil moisture index; Soil water availability; Soil water deficit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to incorporate new equations for wetland hydrology and nutrient removal in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), compare model performance using original and improved equations, and evaluate the ramifications of errors in watershed and tile drain simulation on prediction of NO3-N dynamics in wetlands. The modified equations produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to 0.99 for daily NO3-N load predictions, and percent bias values generally less than 6%. However, statistical improvement over the original equations was marginal and both old and new equations provided accurate simulations. The new equations reduce the model's dependence on detailed monitoring data and hydrologic calibration. Additionally, the modified equations increase SWAT's versatility by incorporating a weir equation and an irreducible nutrient concentration and temperature coefficient. Model improvements enhance the utility of SWAT for simulating flow and nutrients in wetlands and other impoundments, although performance is limited by the accuracy of inflow and NO3-N predictions from the contributing watershed.

To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and contour cropping were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59.6 to 81.0% reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $0.8 and US $5.3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2- and 3-BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80% TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts.

We applied SWAT to the Waccamaw watershed, a shallow aquifer dominated Coastal Plain watershed in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). The model was calibrated (2003-2005) and validated (2006-2007) at two U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations, using significant parameters related to surface hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, and physical properties. SWAT performed best during intervals with wet and normal antecedent conditions with varying sensitivity to effluent channel shape and characteristics. In addition, the calibration of all algorithms depended mostly on Manning's n-value for the tributary channels as the surface friction resistance factor to generate runoff. SUFI-2 and PSO simulated the same relative probability distribution tails to those observed at an upstream outlet, while all methods (except ParaSol) exhibited longer tails at a downstream outlet. The ParaSol model exhibited large skewness suggesting a global search algorithm was less capable of characterizing parameter uncertainty. Our findings provide insights regarding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty as well as modeling diagnostic analysis that can improve hydrologic theory and prediction in complex watersheds.

Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability.

The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline.

Model evaluation revealed that it is possible to meet accepted performance criteria for simulation of monthly total flow, subsurface flow (SSF), and NO3-N loads while obtaining daily surface runoff (SURQ), SSF, and NO3-N concentrations that are not satisfactory. This limits model utility for simulating best management practices (BMPs) and compliance with water quality standards. Although SWAT simulates the soil N-cycle and most predicted fluxes were within ranges reported in agronomic studies, improvements to algorithms for soil-N processes are needed. Variability in N fluxes is extreme and better parameterization and constraint, through use of more detailed agronomic data, would also improve NO3-N simulation in SWAT.

Other results such as climate change related impacts for two eastern Corn Belt watersheds are also discussed. These studies are supported by the CenUSA Bioenergy coordinated agricultural project funded by the USDA to develop a regional system for producing cellulosic biofuels. A description of the evolving federal policy related to cellulosic biofuel production and consumption is provided as are other potential drivers for encouraging the adoption of stover removal, switchgrass, and Miscanthus as perennial feedstocks. Findings from the SWAT studies and their implications for environmental and economic performance in their respective agroecosystems are discussed, and commonalities and divergences in results are identified.

Residential parcels comprise the highest percentage of the revenue in all eight SUFs in Blacksburg and four in Roanoke. For both municipalities, two specific SUFs consistently comprised the highest percentage burden for residential homeowners while three other SUFs demonstrated the highest burden for commercial parcels.

Industrial parcels comprise more revenue in Roanoke, averaging 10.1-4.5% in Blacksburg.

BANCS involves field data collection and the calibration of an empirical model incorporating a bank erodibility hazard index (BEHI) and near-bank shear stress (NBS) estimate. Here we evaluate the applicability of BANCS to the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain, a region that has not been previously studied in this context. Erosion rates averaged over two years expressed the highest variability of any existing BANCS study. As a result, four standard BANCS models did not yield statistically significant correlations to measured erosion rates. Modifications to two widely used NBS estimates improved their correlations (r2 = 0.31 and r2 = 0.33), but further grouping of the data by BEHI weakened these correlations. The high variability in measured erosion rates is partly due to the regional hydrologic and climatic characteristics of the Gulf coastal plains, which include large, infrequent precipitation events. Other sources of variability include variations in bank vegetation and the complex hydro- and morphodynamics of meandering, sand bed channels. We discuss directions for future research in developing a streambank erosion model for this and similar regions. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:28","2018-01-19 22:46:28","","1393-1408","","6","53","","Journal of the American Water Resources Association","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; United States; correlation; Rivers; numerical model; Hazards; calibration; Erosion; empirical analysis; Banks (bodies of water); geomorphology; Geomorphology; Stream flow; stream; Gulf of Mexico; sediment yield; Bank protection; erodibility; Erosion predictions; Gulf Coastal Plain; Hazard indices; meander; morphodynamics; Root density; Rosgen; shear stress; Shear stress; Stream restoration; Streambank erosion; Streambank stabilities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Channel design parameters allowed for the prediction of stable channel form and coincident sediment yields. Measured erosion rates and basin-specific bank erosion curves aided in prediction of the stream channel succession time frame. This understanding is critical in determining how and when to mitigate a myriad of instability consequences. The BVR drains approximately 1,062 km2 in the glaciated region of Northeast Kansas. Once tallgrass prairie, the basin has been modified extensively for agricultural production. As such, channelization has shortened the river by nearly 26 km from pre-European dimensions; shortening combined with the construction of numerous flow-through structures have produced dramatic impacts on discharge and sediment dynamics. Nine stream reaches were established within three main tributaries of the BVR in 2007. Reaches averaged 490 m in length, were surveyed, and assessed for channel stability, while resurveys were conducted annually through 2010 to monitor change. This work illustrates the association of current stream state, in-channel sediment contributions, and prediction of future erosion rates based on stream evolution informed by multiple models.

Sediment cores were extracted prior to basin excavation and restoration to evaluate accretion rates and the origin of materials, retention characteristics of fine particulate matter, and overall pollutant removal efficiency. The sediment and organic layers together accreted 3.2 cm of depth per year, and 7.0 kg/m2/yr of inorganic material. Average annual accretion rates in g/m2/yr were as follows: C, 280; N, 17.7; P, 3.74; S, 3.80; Fe, 194; Mn, 2.68; Ca, 30.8; Mg, 30.7; K, 12.2; Na, 2.54; Zn, 0.858; Cu, 0.203; and B, 0.03. The accretion of C, N, P and sediment was comparable to nonwastewater treatment wetlands, overall, and relatively efficient for stormwater treatment wetlands. Comparison of particle size distribution between sediment cores and suspended solids in stormwater runoff indicated the wetland was effective at removing fine particles, with sediment cores containing 25% clay and 56% silt. A majority of the accretion of most metals and P could be attributed to efficient trapping of allochthonous material, while over half the accretion of C and N could be attributed to accumulation of autochthonous organic matter. Stormwater treatment was shown to be effective when physical properties of a retention basin are combined with the biological processes of a wetland, although sediment accretion can be relatively rapid. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:32","2018-01-19 22:46:32","","1495-1512","","6","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United States; Sedimentation; Sediments; runoff; wastewater treatment; particle size; Storms; pollutant removal; Storm sewers; Nutrients; best management practice; stormwater; Best management practices; constructed wetland; Wetlands; Stormwater treatment; Particle size; Particle size analysis; organic matter; Stormwaters; accretion; allochthon; Fine particulate matter; Inorganic materials; Lake Tahoe Basin; Lifetime performance; Manganese; Particles (particulate matter); particulate matter; Pollutant removal efficiency; Retention characteristics; sediment core; Suspended sediments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an effort to better understand these factors in semiarid northern Utah, United States, we created a real-time observatory consisting of sensors deployed at aquatic and terrestrial stations to monitor water quality, water inputs, and outputs along mountain to urban gradients. The Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT) monitoring network spans three watersheds with similar climates and streams fed by mountain winter-derived precipitation, but that differ in urbanization level, land use, and biophysical characteristics. The aquatic monitoring stations in the GAMUT network include sensors to measure chemical (dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter), physical (stage, temperature, and turbidity), and biological components (chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin). We present the logistics of designing, implementing, and maintaining the network; quality assurance and control of numerous, large datasets; and data acquisition, dissemination, and visualization.

Recently, the USGS developed models for estimating withdrawal at thermoelectric plants to provide estimates independent from plant operator-reported withdrawal data. This article compares three federal datasets of thermoelectric withdrawals for the United States in 2010: one based on the USGS water-use compilation, another based on EIA data, and the third based on USGS model-estimated data. The withdrawal data varied widely. Many plants had three different withdrawal values, and for approximately 54% of the plants the largest withdrawal value was twice the smallest, or larger. The causes of discrepancies among withdrawal estimates included definitional differences, definitional noise, and various nondefinitional causes. The uncertainty in national totals can be characterized by the range among the three datasets, from 5,640 m3/s (129 billion gallons per day [bgd]) to 6,954 m3/s (158 bgd), or by the aggregate difference between the smallest and largest values at each plant, from 4,014 m3/s (92 bgd) to 8,590 m3/s (196 bgd).

These transfers are used to distribute water resources according to supply and demand. The objectives of this work were to quantify the number of IBTs that exist in the United States (U.S.) and to examine the distribution of IBTs and potential causes associated with any observed clustering of IBTs. Defining “basin” was important to enable determination of which transfers qualify as “interbasin.” A variety of definitions are employed by states, with no federal definition. The most recent national studies of IBTs were conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1985 and 1986 using USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) definitions of basins. To build a 2016 inventory of IBTs in the U.S., and to identify where they most commonly occur, the USGS National Hydrography Database (NHD) was utilized in conjunction with the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). Transfers across HUC6 basin boundaries were considered interbasin. Geographical information analysis with the NHD and WBD databases revealed that there are a total of 2,161 man-made waterways crossing HUC6 basin boundaries in the U.S. IBTs are somewhat concentrated: Florida, Texas, and North Carolina account for over 50% of the total identified IBTs. For some states, identified IBTs are locally clustered. Analysis of these clusters suggests a variety of reasons that IBTs have been built, including population, drainage, and agricultural factors. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:39","2018-01-19 22:46:39","","1121-1132","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","GIS; United States; Water resources; surface water; sustainability; water supply; water resource; Geographical information; Economics; Water supply; Florida [United States]; Hydrology; Geographic information systems; Surface waters; water demand; Sustainable development; Texas; Watershed boundaries; Surface water hydrology; U.s. geological surveys; Agricultural factors; Database systems; interbasin transfers; Navigation; North Carolina; Supply and demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, our objective here is to employ the water footprint (WF) concept and methodology to include the virtual or indirect water use to assess the production-side and consumption-side WF of 65 United States (U.S.) cities. The 65 cities include the largest metropolitan areas and some of the major mid-sized cities in the U.S. We use metropolitan areas to define our city boundaries as this is the native spatial resolution of the main datasets used. To estimate the urban WFs, we integrated large and disparate datasets, including commodity flow (agricultural, livestock, and industrial commodities), water use, and socioeconomic data. By analyzing the estimated WF values, we found indirect water use accounts on average for 66% of the WF of consumption. We found some cities are net virtual water exporters (11 of 65) because they rely heavily on direct water uses or are heavy producers of industrial commodities. Also, WF patterns vary widely across the U.S. but regional patterns seem to emerge. For example, the dense cities of the U.S. northeast megaregion have a significantly low per capita WF relative to the other cities, while cities in the Gulf Coast megaregion have a significantly higher industrial WF of production and consumption. Furthermore, there is inequality in the WF of consumption where a few cities account for a disproportionate share of the total U.S. urban water uses. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:43","2018-01-19 22:46:43","","1147-1163","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; sustainability; commodity; Agriculture; Water conservation; water use; spatial resolution; Water use; metropolitan area; Water sustainability; consumptive use; Gulf Coast [United States]; Material Flow; material flow analysis; Urban metabolisms; Virtual water; water footprint; Water footprint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence suggests nutrient trading programs in Virginia will not stimulate investments in pollutant reduction practices on working agricultural lands.

Unfortunately, there are few publicly available data sources at the local level and even fewer at the national scale. In this research, randomly selected points within agricultural lands were examined for selected conservation practices using Google Earth aerial imagery by a team of interpreters. In total, 13,530 points had field boundaries digitized, and were subsequently examined and classified. The presence of terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, center pivot irrigation, strip cropping, ponds, riparian vegetation, filter strips, and land cover were noted. Subjectivity among interpreters was evaluated using duplicate samples and was found to be similar to image misclassification rates in other research. Conservation practice adoption rates for selected major river basins compared favorably with data collected by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project. The frequency of occurrence of each conservation practice was summarized and presented by ecoregion. To facilitate future research, point level data and software source code developed in this research are available via the web at http://nlet.brc.tamus.edu/Conservation.

We evaluated effects of rural land use and exurbanization on streamflows, suspended sediment concentrations and loads, specific conductance, and summer water temperatures in 12 streams and rivers within the Upper Little Tennessee River basin in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Eleven streams featured low levels of development (>61% forest cover) but differed in land use patterning, basin size, annual precipitation, and watershed morphology. One urban stream, located within the largest town in the basin, provided the high development comparative endpoint. Even low levels of rural development and exurbanization were associated with substantial increases in suspended sediment concentrations, sediment loads, and summer stream temperature daily maxima and diurnal variation. Observed summer temperature increases were much larger than would be expected due to global climate change over the next century. Specific conductance was idiosyncratic among the smaller streams. These water quality changes were not accompanied by streamflow changes that were discernible amid the high natural variation in precipitation and geomorphology. The water quality findings suggest the need for applying the best management practices, including riparian buffers, to even low levels of rural development. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:50","2018-01-19 22:46:50","","1212-1228","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; Water quality; streamflow; urbanization; climate change; water quality; Temperature; Rivers; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sediments; Land use; Agriculture; watershed; global climate; Hydrology; river water; precipitation (climatology); water temperature; Stream flow; best management practice; Best management practices; Rural areas; Atmospheric temperature; streamwater; Annual precipitation; mountain region; sediment yield; Suspended sediments; Appalachians; Global climate changes; Little Tennessee River; Regional planning; rural development; Southern Appalachian Mountains; Specific conductance; suspended sediment; Suspended sediment concentrations; Watershed morphology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate hydrological drought probabilities for rivers and streams in the United States (U.S.) using maximum likelihood logistic regression (MLLR). Streamflow data from winter months are used to estimate the chance of hydrological drought during summer months. Daily streamflow data collected from 9,144 stream gages from January 1, 1884 through January 9, 2014 provide hydrological drought streamflow probabilities for July, August, and September as functions of streamflows during October, November, December, January, and February, estimating outcomes 5-11 months ahead of their occurrence. Few drought prediction methods exploit temporal links among streamflows. We find MLLR modeling of drought streamflow probabilities exploits the explanatory power of temporally linked water flows. MLLR models with strong correct classification rates were produced for streams throughout the U.S. One ad hoc test of correct prediction rates of September 2013 hydrological droughts exceeded 90% correct classification. Some of the best-performing models coincide with areas of high concern including the West, the Midwest, Texas, the Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic. Using hydrological drought MLLR probability estimates in a water management context can inform understanding of drought streamflow conditions, provide warning of future drought conditions, and aid water management decision making. © 2017 The Authors.

We offer insight about characteristics of feasible vernal pool policy solutions, and identify gaps in our understanding, particularly regarding conditions in states currently lacking specific vernal pool protections. Vernal pools are geographically isolated, intermittent wetlands that provide important habitat for a variety of plants and animals. Many may not be federally protected as a result of judicial decisions over the past two decades, and the rule intended to clarify what qualifies for federal protection is currently being reviewed by the courts. Thus, state or local policy approaches may be alternatives to conserving vernal pools. We interviewed vernal pool experts in the northeastern U.S. regarding approaches to vernal pool protection and analyzed their perceptions through the lens of Kingdon's () multiple streams policy development framework. The framework denotes 13 characteristics of three processes associated with policy development: problem identification, policy solution development, and the impacts of politics. While analyzed for all 13 components, we found participants most often discussed feasibility of policy formulation and implementation, particularly with regard to protecting vernal pools of high value while also remaining within the bounds of what public opinion supports. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:55","2018-01-19 22:46:55","","1048-1061","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Lakes; Animalia; Wetlands; wetland; animal; Clean waters; Environmental regulations; ephemeral pool; Interviews; Multiple streams; perception; plant; policy development; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; Rapanos; Social aspects; SWANCC; Water policies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study area is Paradise Creek Watershed, a mixed land use watershed in northern Idaho dominated by saturation excess processes in the upstream rural area and infiltration excess in the downstream urban area. We analyzed 12 years of continuous streamflow, precipitation, and watershed data at two monitoring stations. We identified 137 sediment loading events in the upstream rural section of the watershed and 191 events in the downstream urban section. During the majority of these events conditions were transport limited and the sediment flush occurred early in the event, generally in the first 20% of elapsed event time. Statistical analysis including two dozen explanatory variables showed peak discharge, event duration, and antecedent baseflow explained most of the variation in event sediment load at both stations and for the watershed as a whole (R2 = 0.73-0.78). In the rural area, saturated soils combined with spring snowmelt in March led to the greatest loading events. The urban area load contribution peaked in January, which could be a re-suspension of streambed sediments from the previous water year. Throughout the study period, one event contributed, on average, 33% of the annual sediment load but only accounted for 2% of the time in a year. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:46:57","2018-01-19 22:46:57","","1195-1211","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United States; Rivers; sediment transport; Sediments; Land use; Water pollution; runoff; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; infiltration; Watersheds; urban area; Surface waters; climate effect; rural area; River pollution; Rural areas; fluvial deposit; baseflow; resuspension; Explanatory variables; Surface water hydrology; nonpoint source pollution; Suspended sediments; Non-point source pollution; Idaho; Infiltration excess; Loading; Loads (forces); Seasonal distributions; Sediment delivery; Sediment loading; stream bed; Streambed sediments; urban ecosystem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More recently, stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented in a low impact development (LID) manner to treat stormwater runoff closer to its source. This approach included the development of a novel BMP model to compare traditional and LID design, pioneering the use of comprehensively digitized storm sewer infrastructure and BMP design connectivity with spatial patterns in a geographic information system at the watershed scale. The goal was to compare total watershed pollutant removal efficiency in two study watersheds with differing spatial patterns of BMP design (traditional and LID), by quantifying the improved water quality benefit of LID BMP design. An estimate of uncertainty was included in the modeling framework by using ranges for BMP pollutant removal efficiencies that were based on the literature. Our model, using Monte Carlo analysis, predicted that the LID watershed removed approximately 78 kg more nitrogen, 3 kg more phosphorus, and 1,592 kg more sediment per square kilometer as compared with the traditional watershed on an annual basis. Our research provides planners a valuable model to prioritize watersheds for BMP design based on model results or in optimizing BMP selection. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

Precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0.1 mm and aggregated to 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time steps. Daily discharge data over a 10-year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE ≈ 0.47). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (55%) and tile flow (42%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for (1) the selection of sensitive parameters, (2) performance statistics, (3) the shape of the hydrographs, and (4) flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high. The study suggests that there is no need in using precipitation time steps <1 h for lowland catchments dominated by soils with a low surface runoff potential if daily flow values are being considered.

Long-term (1984-2015) measured daily streamflow data from Rock Creek watershed, an agricultural watershed in northern Ohio, were used for this study. Data were divided into five Short (5-year), two Medium (15-year), and one Long (25-year) streamflow calibration data scenarios. All LCD scenarios were calibrated and validated at three time steps: daily, monthly, and annual. Results showed LCD affected the ability of the model to accurately capture temporal variability in simulated streamflow.

However, these ubiquitous assets, valued at approximately $600,000 per km2 in a representative suburban watershed, are ideal candidates to aid in reversing such cycles of channel degradation because improving their functionality would not necessarily require property acquisition or heavy construction. The objective of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective device that could be installed in detention basin outlets to reduce the erosive power of the relatively frequent storm events ( &lt; two-year recurrence) and provide a passive bypass to maintain flood control performance during infrequent storms (such as the 100-year recurrence). Results from a pilot installation show that the Detain H2O device reduced the cumulative sediment transport capacity of the preretrofit condition by greater than 40%, and contributed to reduced flashiness and prolonged baseflows in receiving streams. When scaling the strategy across a watershed, these results suggest that potential gains in water quality and stream channel stability could be achieved at costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable benefits from newly constructed stormwater control measures. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:06","2018-01-19 22:47:06","","1032-1047","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; urbanization; water quality; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Flood control; runoff; watershed; Watersheds; flood control; Storm-water managements; Storms; Cost effectiveness; Quality control; Storm sewers; best management practice; Best management practices; stream channel; aquatic environment; critical flow; Detention basin; hydromodification; Retrofitting; Stream stability; suburban area","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed a HL classification for the Bristol Bay watershed of southwest Alaska that incorporates indices of annual climate and seasonality, terrain, geology, and the influences of large lakes and glaciers. A HL classification is particularly useful in this large watershed because of its hydrologic and landscape variability, important salmon fishery, variety of environmental and potential anthropogenic stressors, and lack of widespread hydrologic data. Following creation of Bristol Bay basin-wide HL classes, we compared the HL distributions within watersheds grouped by two calculated runoff parameters derived from available long-term streamflow records and found HL distributions within these groups provided predictive insight on hydrologic behavior. Using these developed runoff groups, we estimated expected hydrologic behavior in watersheds across the larger Bristol Bay watershed that lacked gauged streamflow records.

Because Ep is not a climate-model output, an intermediary model of Ep must be introduced to connect the climate model to the hydrologic model. Several Ep methods are used. The suitability of each can be assessed by noting a credible Ep method for offline analyses should be able to reproduce climate models’ ACC-driven changes in actual evapotranspiration in regions and seasons of negligible water stress (Ew). We quantified this ability for seven commonly used Ep methods and for a simple proportionality with available energy (“energy-only” method). With the exception of the energy-only method, all methods tend to overestimate substantially the increase in Ep associated with ACC. In an offline hydrologic model, the Ep-change biases produce excessive increases in actual evapotranspiration (E), whether the system experiences water stress or not, and thence strong negative biases in runoff change, as compared to hydrologic fluxes in the driving climate models. The runoff biases are comparable in magnitude to the ACC-induced runoff changes themselves. These results suggest future hydrologic drying (wetting) trends likely are being systematically and substantially overestimated (underestimated) in many water-resource impact analyses. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

During the last two decades, the lake water level has risen by nearly 10 m, causing floods that have cost more than 1 billion USD in mitigation measures. Another increase of approximately 1.5 m in the lake water level would cause spillage into the Sheyenne River. To alleviate this potentially catastrophic spillage, two artificial outlets were constructed. However, the artificial drainage of water into the Sheyenne River raises water quality concerns because the Devils Lake water contains significantly higher concentrations of dissolved solids, particularly sulfate. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with the CE-QUAL-W2 model to simulate both water balance and sulfate concentrations in the lake. The SWAT model performed well in simulating daily flow in tributaries with ENS &gt; 0.5 and |PBIAS| &lt; 25%, and reproduced the lake water level with a root mean square error of 0.35 m for the study period from 1995 to 2014. The water temperature and sulfate concentrations simulated by CE-QUAL-W2 for the lake are in general agreement with the field observations. The model results show that the operation of the two outlets since August 2005 has lowered the lake level by 0.70 m. Furthermore, the models show pumping water from the two outlets raises sulfate concentrations in the Sheyenne River from 100 to &gt;500 mg/L.

The SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes model and downscaled P and T outputs from 14 general circulation models were used to explore impacts on nitrogen yield. Results of the analysis suggest that projected changes in P and T will decrease nitrogen yield for the majority of the contiguous U.S., including the watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico. Some regions, however, such as the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, are projected to face climatic conditions that, according to the model results, may increase nitrogen yield.

The study investigated whether the relative change in irrigation use between two years preceding and two years following installation was a reliable predictor of a homeowner's satisfaction with the device and likelihood of continuing to use it. Results indicated relative changes in irrigation use were only significantly associated with the quality of controller programming. Satisfaction with the controller was largely attributable to satisfaction with the appearance of the landscape and the perceived water-saving effectiveness of the controller whereas the likelihood of its continued use was only significantly predicted by the level of technical knowledge regarding its functioning and whether or not challenges were experienced with it.

Understanding the impacts of water use for hydraulic fracturing (HF) on water availability in semiarid regions is critical for management and regulatory decisions. In the current work, we quantify water use for HF at several scales — from municipal to state-wide — using the IHS Enerdeq database for the South Platte Basin. In addition, we estimate produced water (a by-product of oil and gas production), using data from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to explore reuse scenarios. The South Platte River Basin, located in northeastern Colorado, encompasses the Denver-Metro area. The basin has one of the most productive oil and gas shale formations in Colorado, with much of the production occurring in Weld County. The basin has experienced higher horizontal drilling rates coupled with an increasing population. Results show water use for horizontal and vertical wells averages 11,000 and 1,000 m3, respectively. Water use for HF in the South Platte Basin totaled 0.63% of the basin's 2014 total water demand. For Weld County, water use for HF was 2.4% of total demand, and for the city of Greeley, water use was 7% of total demand. Produced water totaled 9.4 Mm3 in the basin for 2014, which represents 42% of the total water used for HF. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:27","2018-01-19 22:47:27","","839-853","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; database; water availability; water supply; water management; Watersheds; Water supply; Water conservation; water use; Colorado; water demand; semiarid region; Stream flow; Water use; Arid regions; Produced Water; Gases; hydraulic fracturing; Hydraulic fracturing; Water availability; Denver; energy; Energy-water nexus; gas production; Greeley; horizontal drilling; Horizontal drilling; Horizontal wells; Oil and gas conservation commissions; Oil and gas production; oil production; Regulatory decisions; Semi-arid region; Shale oil; South Platte Basin; South Platte River; Weld County; Welds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithms used to produce these maps ensure water budget consistency over this broad spatial scale, with contributions from precipitation influx attributed to each component at 800 m resolution. The quick-flow runoff estimates for the contribution to the rapidly varying portion of the hydrograph are produced using data from 1,434 gaged watersheds, and depend on precipitation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and surficial geology type. Evapotranspiration estimates are produced from a regression using water balance data from 679 gaged watersheds and depend on land cover, temperature, and precipitation. The quick-flow and ET estimates are combined to calculate recharge as the remainder of precipitation. The ET and recharge estimates are checked against independent field data, and the results show good agreement. Comparisons of recharge estimates with groundwater extraction data show that in 15% of the country, groundwater is being extracted at rates higher than the local recharge. These maps of the internally consistent water budget components of recharge, quick-flow runoff, and ET, being derived from and tested against data, are expected to provide reliable first-order estimates of these quantities across the CONUS, even where field measurements are sparse. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

Few other national-scale floodplain data are available. We acquired FIRMs for a large watershed and compared FIRMs to floodplain and integrated wetland area mapping methods based on (1) geospatial distance, (2) geomorphic setting, and (3) soil characteristics. We used observed flooding events (OFEs) with recurrence intervals of 25-50 to >100 years to assess floodplain estimate accuracy. FIRMs accurately reflected floodplain areas based on OFEs and covered 32% of river length, whereas soil-based mapping was not as accurate as FIRMs but characterized floodplain areas over approximately 65% of stream length. Geomorphic approaches included more areas than indicated by OFE, whereas geospatial approaches tended to cover less area. Overall, soil-based methods have the highest utility in determining floodplains and their integrated wetland areas at large scales due to the use of nationally available data and flexibility for regional application.

Channel routing is a typical example of the mathematical conceptualization of watershed landscape and processes in hydrologic modeling. We investigated the sensitivity of accuracy, equifinality, and uncertainty of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling to channel dimensions to demonstrate how a conceptual representation of a watershed system affects streamflow and sediment modeling. Results showed the amount of uncertainty and equifinality strongly responded to channel dimensions. On the other hand, the model performance did not significantly vary with the changes in the channel representation due to the degree of freedom allowed by the conceptual nature of hydrologic modeling in the parameter calibration. Such findings demonstrated good modeling performance statistics do not necessarily mean small output uncertainty, and partial improvements in the watershed representation may neither increase modeling accuracy nor reduce uncertainty. We also showed the equifinality and uncertainty of hydrologic modeling are case-dependent rather than specific to models or regions, suggesting great caution should be used when attempting to transfer uncertainty analysis results to other modeling studies, especially for ungauged watersheds.

When developing regional curves, the degree to which landform, geology, climate, and vegetation influence stream systems within a single physiographic province may not be fully considered. This study examined the use of the U.S. Geological Survey's Hydrologic Landscape Regions (HLR), as well as data from 2,856 independent sites throughout the contiguous United States (U.S.), to develop a set of regional curves (bankfull discharge, cross-sectional area, width, and mean depth) for (1) the contiguous U.S., (2) each of the 20 HLRs, (3) each of the eight physiographic divisions, (4) 22 of the 25 physiographic provinces, and (5) individual HLRs within the physiographic provinces. These regional curves were then compared to each other, as well as those from the literature. Regional curves developed for individual HLRs, physiographic divisions, and physiographic provinces tended to outperform the contiguous U.S. indicating increased stratification was beneficial. Further stratifying physiographic provinces by HLR markedly improved regional curve reliability. Use of HLR as a basis of regional curve development, rather than physiographic region alone, may allow for the development of more robust regional curves. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:35","2018-01-19 22:47:35","","903-928","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; hydrology; river; spatial analysis; fluvial geomorphology; watershed; management practice; Water conservation; Geomorphology; Landforms; geometry; Soil conservation; Stream flow; stream; drainage; Geology; Image reconstruction; geological survey; Watershed management; Rivers/streams; environmental restoration; geomorphological mapping; Hydraulic geometry; Landscape units; Regional curves; site investigation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agricultural drainage ditches function to remove water quickly from farmed landscapes. Conventional ditch designs lack the form and function of natural stream systems and tend to be unstable and provide inadequate habitat. In October of 2009, 1.89 km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to an alternative system with a two-stage channel to investigate the improvements in water quality, stability, and habitat. Longitudinal surveys show a 12-fold increase in the pool-riffle formation. Cross-sectional surveys show an average increase in bankfull width of approximately 10% and may be associated to an increased frequency in large storm events. The average increase in bankfull depth was estimated as 18% but is largely influenced by pool formation. Rosgen Stability Analyses show the channel to be highly stable and the banks at a low risk of erosion. The average bankfull recurrence interval was estimated to be approximately 0.30 years. Overall, the two-stage ditch design demonstrates an increase in fluvial stability, creating a more consistent sediment budget, and increasing the frequency of important instream habitat features, making this best management practice a viable option for addressing issues of erosion, sediment imbalance, and poor habitat in agricultural drainage systems. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:37","2018-01-19 22:47:37","","886-902","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water quality; design; instream flow; water quality; channel morphology; risk assessment; Agriculture; Ecosystems; watershed; crop production; Cultivation; Erosion; Budget control; Stream flow; best management practice; drainage; Best management practices; Surveys; Drainage; construction; Minnesota; Drainage ditches; erosion; fluvial process; Fluvial process; habitat restoration; In-stream habitats; Mower County; Physical stability; recurrence interval; Stability; System stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we examined the link between soil erosion and delivery of eroded soil to streams during flow events, and the impact of that freshly deposited soil on dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations and periphyton growth under baseflow conditions when the risk of stream eutrophication is greatest. A microcosm experiment was designed to simulate the release of P from soil which had been amended with different amounts of P fertilizer to overlying water during baseflow conditions. Unglazed tiles, inoculated for five days in a second order stream, were incubated for seven days in microcosms containing soil with eight levels of soil Mehlich-3 plant available phosphorus (M3P) ranging from 20 to 679 mg/kg M3P. Microcosm DRP was monitored. Following incubation tiles were scraped and the periphyton analyzed for chlorophyll a. Microcosm DRP concentrations increased with increasing soil M3P and equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0). Relationships between M3P, EPC0, and DRP were nonlinear and increases in soil M3P and/or DRP had a greater impact on biomass accumulation when these parameters were above threshold values of 30 mg/kg M3P and 0.125 mg/L DRP. Significantly, this ecological threshold corresponds to the agronomic thresholds above which increased soil M3P does not increase plant response. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:39","2018-01-19 22:47:39","","809-821","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Freshwater; Ecology; Agriculture; Water; Erosion; Soils; Soil pollution; soil erosion; agricultural land; Chlorophyll; Urban growth; Phosphorus; growth; freshwater environment; Eutrophication; baseflow; Agricultural runoff; agronomy; alluvial deposit; Available phosphorus; biomass; Biomass accumulation; chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll a; Diffuse pollution; eutrophication; Fluvial sediment; Microcosm experiments; nutrient limitation; periphyton; Phosphorus concentration; phosphorus cycle; pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many states have established regulatory temperature thresholds, referred to as numeric criteria, to protect cold-water fishes such as salmon and trout. We examined across-year and within-year patterns of exceedance at control and treatment stream temperature probes. Determining whether an exceedance at the downstream end of a harvest was unambiguously related to harvest proved surprisingly difficult. The likelihood of a site exceeding its numeric criterion appeared related, in part, to the site's preharvest temperature range. Four control reaches as well as three preharvest treatment reaches exceeded their numeric criteria, necessitating additional analysis to evaluate timber harvest impacts. Nine percent of sites (3 of 33) both exceeded their numeric criteria and exhibited a potential harvest effect (16.7% of private sites [3 of 18], 0% of State sites [0 of 15]). After harvest, exceedances were typically observed in only the first of the two post-harvest years. These findings highlight the importance of including temporal and spatial controls in temperature assessments of numeric criteria when the assessment's purpose is to determine whether exceedances are related to human activities. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:42","2018-01-19 22:47:42","","761-773","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Temperature; anthropogenic effect; spatiotemporal analysis; environmental management; numerical method; environmental monitoring; Forestry; riparian zone; human activity; Stream temperatures; water temperature; Harvesting; Oregon; Monitoring; best management practice; stream; Best management practices; threshold; nonpoint source pollution; Non-point source pollution; Environmental regulations; Temporal and spatial; Before-after control impacts; Forest harvest; forestry practice; harvesting; Pisces; Salmonidae; spatial data; temperature profile; Temperature range; Temperature thresholds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies report downstream sediment deposition following dam removal is influenced by proximity to the source and river transport capacity. The impacts of dam removal sediment releases are difficult to generalize due to the relatively small number of dam removals completed, the variation in release strategies, and the physical nature of systems. Changes to sediment deposition and associated streambed composition in the Elwha River, Washington State, were monitored prior to (2010-2011) and during (2012-2014) the simultaneous removal of two large dams (32 and 64 m). Changes in the surface layer substrate composition during dam removal varied by year and channel type. Riffles in floodplain channels downstream of the dams fined and remained sand dominated throughout the study period, and exceeded levels known to be detrimental to incubating salmonids. Mainstem riffles tended to fine to gravel, but appear to be trending toward cobble after the majority of the sediment was released and transported through system. Thus, salmonid spawning habitats in the mainstem appear to have been minimally impacted while those in floodplain channels appear to have been severely impacted during dam removal. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

Large investments have been made by government agencies to provide nationally-available spatial databases; however, their relevance and suitability for local watershed applications is largely unscrutinized. We investigated how goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of total phosphorus (TP) concentration models developed from nationally-available spatial data could be improved by including local watershed-specific data in the East Fork of the Little Miami River, Ohio, a 1,290 km2 watershed. We also determined whether a spatial stream network (SSN) modeling approach improved on multiple linear regression (nonspatial) models. Goodness of fit and predictive accuracy were highest for the SSN model that included local covariates, and lowest for the nonspatial model developed from national data. Septic systems and point source TP loads were significant covariates in the local models. These local data not only improved the models but enabled a more explicit interpretation of the processes affecting TP concentrations than more generic national covariates. The results suggest SSN modeling greatly improves prediction and should be applied when using national covariates. Including local covariates further increases the accuracy of TP predictions throughout the studied watershed; such variables should be included in future national databases, particularly the locations of septic systems. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

Collectively, all water use sectors must identify, understand, and respond to this risk. A highly visual and computationally robust decision support tool, Water Prism, quantitatively explores mitigation responses to water risk on both a facility-level and basin-aggregated basis. Water Prism examines a basin water balance for a 40- to 60-year planning horizon, distinguishes among water use sectors, and accounts for ecosystem water needs. The 2012 Texas State Water Plan was used to apply Water Prism to the Big Cypress-Sulphur Basin (Texas). The case study showed Water Prism to be an accurate and convenient tool to provide fine-scale understanding of water use in the context of available supply, evaluate multi-sector combinations of conservation strategies, and quantify the effects of future demands and water availability. Analyses demonstrated water availability risks for rivers and reservoirs can vary within a basin and must be calculated independently, simulation of water balance conditions can help illuminate potential impacts of increasing demands, and scenario simulations can be used to evaluate relative conservation efficacy of different water resource management strategies for each sector. Based on case study findings, Water Prism can serve as a useful assessment tool for regional water planners. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:50","2018-01-19 22:47:50","","605-625","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Water management; Water resources; Water resources management; reservoir; river; sustainability; water supply; water planning; water management; Risk perception; decision support system; Decision support systems; risk assessment; water resource; Artificial intelligence; assessment method; Natural resources management; Water conservation; water demand; Sustainable development; Reservoirs (water); Waterresource management; water budget; water use efficiency; Cupressus; Planning; mitigation; Conservation strategies; Prisms; Scenario simulations; Stakeholder collaboration; Water allocations; Water efficiency; Water management strategies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Representation of the spatiotemporal variability in snowmelt processes in continental-scale hydrologic models is critical for assessment of water resource response to continued climate change. Continental-extent hydrologic models such as the U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrologic Model (NHM) represent snowmelt processes through the application of snow depletion curves (SDCs). SDCs relate normalized snow water equivalent (SWE) to normalized snow covered area (SCA) over a snowmelt season for a given modeling unit. SDCs were derived using output from the operational Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) snow model as daily 1-km gridded SWE over the conterminous United States. Daily SNODAS output were aggregated to a predefined watershed-scale geospatial fabric and used to also calculate SCA from October 1, 2004 to September 30, 2013. The spatiotemporal variability in SNODAS output at the watershed scale was evaluated through the spatial distribution of the median and standard deviation for the time period. Representative SDCs for each watershed-scale modeling unit over the conterminous United States (n = 54,104) were selected using a consistent methodology and used to create categories of snowmelt based on SDC shape. The relation of SDC categories to the topographic and climatic variables allow for national-scale categorization of snowmelt processes. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:47:55","2018-01-19 22:47:55","","626-640","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; Water management; Water quality; discharge; dry season; streamflow; urbanization; Urbanization; irrigation; water quality; water management; Drought; water resource; Watersheds; Water conservation; Irrigation; water use; California; hydrological response; urban planning; Stream flow; standard (regulation); Planning; Streamflow response; Water quality standard; Water policies; Ballona Creek; Conservation policy; Environmental mitigation; environmental policy; Los angeles; Los Angeles [California]; Water restrictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is shown that when the response of streamflow to pumping is nonlinear, simple methods for impact calculation can fail. The proposed method is developed for the case when there are four entities that impact streamflow. The method relies on the calculation of impacts by perturbation of the simulation model from different base pumping levels. When four entities are evaluated, 16 runs of the simulation model are required. It is shown the proposed method produces estimated impacts for each individual entity that are equitable because they meet the requirement that the impacts of each entity sum to the total impacts of all entities acting together and the impacts attributed to each entity do not depend on the order of calculation.

However, a good simulation of discharge is not necessarily the result of a realistic simulation of hydrological processes within the catchment. We propose an evaluation framework that considers both discharge and water balance components as evaluation criteria for calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). In this study, we integrated average annual values of surface runoff, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration in the model evaluation procedure to constrain the selection of good model runs for the Little River Experimental Watershed in Georgia, United States. For evaluating water balance and discharge dynamics, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and percent bias (PBIAS) were used. In addition, the ratio of root mean square error and standard deviation of measured data (RSR) was calculated for individual segments of the flow duration curve to identify the best model runs in terms of discharge magnitude. Our results indicate that good statistics for discharge do not guarantee realistic simulations of individual water balance components. Therefore, we recommend constraining the ranges of water balance components to achieve a more realistic simulation of the entire hydrological system, even if tradeoffs between good statistics for discharge simulations and reasonable amounts of the water balance components are unavoidable.

The concept has found some success with point source water pollution, but very few trades have occurred in over 50 programs in the United States (U.S.) that have focused on nonpoint sources (NPSs). To understand why success has been slow, we identified three environments needed for programs to succeed: physical, economic, and institutional. We estimate that only 5% of watersheds in the U.S. currently listed as nutrient impaired provide a viable physical environment for trading nitrogen; 13% are suitable for phosphorus. Economic and institutional challenges would shrink that domain even further. Therefore, we find places with the ideal physical, economic, and institutional environments necessary for feasible WQT programs are virtual policy utopias — rare places with ideal environments.

Phosphorus traps include floodplains, wetlands, and lakes, which can then become impaired by eutrophication. The Sunrise River watershed in east central Minnesota, United States, has numerous lakes impaired by excess phosphorus. The Sunrise is tributary to the St. Croix River, whose much larger watershed is terminated by Lake St. Croix, also impaired by excess phosphorus. To support management of these impairments at both local and regional scales, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Sunrise watershed was constructed to estimate load reductions due to selected best management practices (BMPs) and to determine how phosphorus export coefficients scaled with contributing area. In this study, agricultural BMPs, including vegetated filter strips, grassed waterways, and reduction of soil-phosphorus concentrations reduced phosphorus loads by 4-20%, with similar percentage reductions at field and watershed spatial scales. Phosphorus export coefficients from cropland in rotation with corn, soybeans, and alfalfa decreased as a negative power function of contributing area, from an average of 2.12 kg/ha/yr at the upland field scale ( 0.6 km2) to 0.63 kg/ha/yr at the major river basin scale (20,000 km2).

This uncertainty is compounded by potential effects of future climate change. We examined historical variability in annual and growing season precipitation, temperature, and streamflow within the Little Missouri River Basin and identified differences in the runoff response to precipitation for the period 1976-2012 compared to 1939-1975 (n = 37 years in both cases). Computed mean values for the second half of the record showed little change (<5%) in annual or growing season precipitation, but average annual runoff at the basin outlet decreased by 22%, with 66% of the reduction in flow occurring during the growing season. Our results show a statistically significant (p < 0.10) 27% decrease in the annual runoff response to precipitation (runoff ratio). Surface-water withdrawals for various uses appear to account for <12% of the reduction in average annual flow volume, and we found no published or reported evidence of substantial flow reduction caused by groundwater pumping in this basin. Results of our analysis suggest that increases in monthly average maximum and minimum temperatures, including >1°C increases in January through March, are the dominant driver of the observed decrease in runoff response to precipitation in the Little Missouri River Basin. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.

In this setting, there is great potential for equifinality of parameters during the optimization process, especially for parameters that are not directly related to streamflow. Therefore, some of the optimal parameter values achieved during the autocalibration process may be physically unrealistic. In recent decades a vast array of data from land surface models and remote sensing platforms can help to constrain hydrologic fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET). While the spatial resolution of these ancillary datasets varies, the continuous spatial coverage of these gridded datasets provides flux measurements across the entire basin, in stark contrast to point-based streamflow data. This study uses Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Model data to constrain Soil and Water Assessment Tool parameter values associated with ET to a more physically realistic range. The study area is the Little Washita River Experimental Watershed, in southern Oklahoma. Traditional objective metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients record no performance improvement after application of this method. However, there is a dramatic increase in the number of days with receding flow where simulations match observed streamflow. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:13","2018-01-19 22:48:13","","593-604","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Evapotranspiration; United States; database; evapotranspiration; optimization; streamflow; data set; land surface; remote sensing; parameter estimation; hydrological modeling; watershed; soil and water assessment tool; Hydrologic modeling; calibration; Watersheds; Soil and Water assessment tools; Remote sensing; River basins; spatial resolution; Stream flow; array; SWAT model; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; GLEAM; Little Washita Basin; Little washita river experimental watersheds; Oklahoma [United States]; Remotely sensed evapotranspirations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multi-year plot-scale study was conducted on an eroded claypan soil with the following objectives: (1) assess the effects of buffer width, vegetation, and season on runoff transport of atrazine (ATR), metolachlor (MET), and glyphosate; (2) develop VBS design criteria for herbicides; and (3) compare differences in soil quality among vegetation treatments. Rainfall simulation was used to create uniform antecedent soil water content and to generate runoff. Vegetation treatment and buffer width impacted herbicide loads much more than season. Grass treatments reduced herbicide loads by 19-28% and sediment loads by 67% compared to the control. Grass treatments increased retention of dissolved-phase herbicides by both infiltration and adsorption, but adsorption accounted for the greatest proportion of retained herbicide load. This latter finding indicated VBS can be effective on poorly drained soils or when the source to buffer area ratio is high. Grass treatments modestly improved surface soil quality 8-13 years after establishment, with significant increases in organic C, total N, and ATR and MET sorption compared to continuously tilled control. Herbicide loads as a function of buffer width were well described by first-order decay models which indicated VBS can provide significant load reductions under anticipated field conditions. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:17","2018-01-19 22:48:17","","667-683","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Vegetation; rainfall; seasonality; vegetation cover; runoff; adsorption; pollutant transport; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Buffer strip; buffer zone; Quality control; soil erosion; pollution control; atrazine; glyphosate; Glyphosates; Herbicide transport; Herbicides; metolachlor; Metolachlors; phytoremediation; retention; soil quality; Soil quality; soil remediation; Weed control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The slope-area method utilizes digital elevation model (DEM) and related information to develop slope-area threshold relationships used to estimate the position of channel heads in the watershed. A total of 162 stream channel heads were mapped across the three physiographic regions of Alabama, including the Southwestern Appalachians (51), Piedmont/Ridge and Valley (61), and Coastal Plains (51). Using Geographic Information System and DEM, the local slope and drainage area for each mapped channel head was calculated and region-specific models were developed and evaluated. Results demonstrated the local slope and drainage area had an inverse and strong correlation in the Piedmont/Ridge and Valley region (r2 = 0.71) and the Southwestern Appalachian region (r2 = 0.61). Among three physiographic regions, the weakest correlation was observed in the Coastal Plain region (r2 = 0.45). By comparing the locations of modeled channel heads to those located in the field, calculated reliability and sensitivity indices indicated model accuracy and reliance were weak to moderate. However, the slope-area method helped define the upstream boundaries of a more detailed channel network than that derived from the 1:24,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset, which is commonly used for planning and regulatory purposes. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:20","2018-01-19 22:48:20","","562-575","","3","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; correlation; hydrological modeling; sediment transport; analytical method; accuracy assessment; Forestry; mapping; Geographic information systems; Landforms; Information systems; slope; digital elevation model; Surveying; Alabama; River network; drainage; Inverse problems; stream channel; Stream channels; Appalachians; channel flow; Channel initiation; Headwaters; hydraulic head; Piedmont [United States]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The consequence is that project analysis must account for the nonseparability among the component parts of IWRM plans. This article presents a benefit-cost (B-C) analysis of a set of projects included in the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan proposed for the Yakima Basin in south-central Washington State. The analysis accounts for interdependence among proposed water storage projects and between water storage and water market development in the context of historical and more adverse projected future climate scenarios. Focusing on irrigation benefits from storage, we show that the value of a given proposed storage project is lower when other proposed storage projects in the basin are implemented, and when water markets are functioning effectively. We find that none of the water storage projects satisfy a B-C criterion, and that assuring proposed instream flow augmentation is less expensive by purchasing senior diversion rights than relying on new storage to provide it. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:23","2018-01-19 22:48:23","","456-477","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Water resources; instream flow; water management; Resource allocation; water resource; integrated approach; Economics; Water supply; Natural resources management; water storage; climate effect; Costs; Water market; Water storage; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Washington [United States]; Washington State; Benefit-cost analysis; Cost accounting; cost-benefit analysis; Future climate scenarios; Integrated plans; Integrated water resource management; Management activities; market development; River basin projects; water economics; Yakima Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trends among eight small watersheds were compared, using a time trend study design. Significant trends were detected in three storm hydrologic metrics and in five water quality constituents that were adjusted for variability in storm characteristics and climate. Trends in EIA ranged from 0.10 to 1.35, and changes in EIA treated by BMPs ranged from 0.19 to 1.32; both expressed in units of percentage of drainage area per year. Trend relations indicated that for every 1% increase in watershed EIA, about 2.6, 1.1, and 1.5% increases in EIA treated by BMPs would be required to counteract the effects of EIA added to the watersheds on peak streamflow, stormwater yield, and storm streamflow runoff, respectively. Relations between trends in EIA, BMP implementation, and water quality were counterintuitive. This may be the result of (1) changes in constituent inputs in the watersheds, especially downstream of areas treated by BMPs; (2) BMPs may have increased the duration of stormflow that results in downstream channel erosion; and/or (3) spurious relationships between increases in EIA, BMP implementation, and constituent inputs with development rates. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:26","2018-01-19 22:48:26","","382-399","","2","53","","Journal of the American Water Resources Association","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United States; Water quality; design; streamflow; urbanization; Urbanization; trend analysis; water quality; runoff; watershed; Watersheds; Storm-water managements; Storms; Lakes; basin management; Storm sewers; Stream flow; best management practice; stormwater; Best management practices; peak flow; nonpoint source pollution; Non-point source pollution; Georgia; Detention pond; Gwinnett County; Impervious area; pond; Storm flow; Storm runoff","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We further expected that nitrate concentrations would be higher in surface water and groundwater at the base of short flow paths with alder and that streamside wetlands at the base of alder-near flow paths would be less nitrogen limited than wetlands at the base of long flow paths with alder. Our results showed that groundwater nitrate-N concentrations were significantly higher at alder-near sites than at no-alder sites, but did not differ significantly between alder-far sites and no-alder sites or between alder-far sites and alder-near sites.

Runoff data from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was used as input to RAPID. This article investigates the effect of topography on RAPID performance, the differences between the VIC-RAPID streamflow simulations in the HUC-2 regions of the MRB, and the impact of major dams on the streamflow simulations. The model performance improved when initial parameter values, especially the Muskingum K parameter, were estimated by taking topography into account. The statistical summary indicates the RAPID model performs better in the Ohio and Tennessee Regions and the Upper and Lower Mississippi River Regions in comparison to the western part of the MRB, due to the better performance of the VIC model.

A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to assess the sensitivity of different parameters that control streambank erosion such as critical shear stress, erodibility, weathering depth, and weathering duration. The sensitive parameters were adjusted and the model was calibrated based on the bank erosion severity category identified by the RAP-M field assessment. The average observed erosion rates were in the range 25-367 mm year−1. The SWAT model was able to reasonably predict the bank erosion rates within the range of variability observed in the field (R2= 0.90; E = 0.78).

The CN method does not account for the spatial distribution of land cover types, an important factor controlling runoff patterns. The objective of this study was to empirically derive CN values that reflect the strategic placement of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within row crop agricultural landscapes. CNs were derived using precipitation and runoff data from a seven-year period for 14 small watersheds in Iowa. The watersheds were planted with varying amounts of NPV located in different watershed positions. The least squares and asymptotic least squares methods (LSM) were used to derive CNs using an initial abstraction coefficient (λ) of 0.2 and 0.05. The CNs were verified using leave-one-out cross-validation and adjustment for antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) was tested. The asymptotic method produced CN values for watersheds with NPV treatment that were 8.9 and 14.7% lower than watersheds with 100% row crop at λ = 0.2 and λ = 0.05, respectively. The derived CNs produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 during validation. Our analyses show the CNs verified best for the asymptotic LSM, when using λ of 0.05 and adjusting for AMC. Further, comparison of derived CNs against an area weighted CN indicated that the placement of vegetation does impact the CN value.

However, the high computational expense of many hydraulic models renders their use impractical for ensemble forecasting. To address this challenge, we developed a rating curve library method for flood inundation forecasting. This method involves pre-running a hydraulic model using multiple inflows and extracting rating curves, which prescribe a relation between streamflow and stage at various cross sections along a river reach. For a given streamflow, flood stage at each cross section is interpolated from the pre-computed rating curve library to delineate flood inundation depths and extents at a lower computational cost. In this article, we describe the workflow for our rating curve library method and the Rating Curve based Automatic Flood Forecasting (RCAFF) software that automates this workflow. We also investigate the feasibility of using this method to transform ensemble streamflow forecasts into local, probabilistic flood inundation delineations for the Onion and Shoal Creeks in Austin, Texas. While our results show water surface elevations from RCAFF are comparable to those from the hydraulic models, the ensemble streamflow forecasts used as inputs to RCAFF are the largest source of uncertainty in predicting observed floods. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:40","2018-01-19 22:48:40","","300-315","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; streamflow; Uncertainty assessment; software; Uncertainty analysis; probability; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Flood forecasting; Forecasting; Hydraulic models; Weather forecasting; uncertainty analysis; flood forecasting; Austin [Texas]; Texas; Stream flow; map; Rating; rating curve; Allium cepa; Computational expense; Flood inundation modeling; Initial and boundary conditions; Inundation maps; Rating curve; Water surface elevations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measured the three-dimensional velocity field at seven cross sections near a diversion pipe and constructed regression equations of the observed maximum velocities near the pipe. Because the velocity components in three directions (longitudinal, transverse, and vertical) were significantly greater near the diversion pipe inlet compared with those farther from it, they cannot be neglected in the modeling and design of fish guidance and protection devices for diversion pipes.

Considerable research has improved flood forecasting accuracy (e.g., more accurate prediction of the occurrence of flood events) and lead time. However, the delivery of improved forecast information alone is not necessarily sufficient to reduce flood damage and loss of life, as people have varying responses and reactions to flood warnings. This study develops an agent-based modeling framework that evaluates the impacts of heterogeneity in human behaviors (i.e., variation in behaviors in response to flood warnings), as well as residential density, on the benefits of flood warnings. The framework is coupled with a traffic model to simulate evacuation processes within a road network under various flood warning scenarios. The results show the marginal benefit associated with providing better flood warnings is significantly constrained if people behave in a more risk-tolerant manner, especially in high-density residential areas. The results also show significant impacts of human behavioral heterogeneity on the benefits of flood warnings, and thus stress the importance of considering human behavioral heterogeneity in simulating flood warning-response systems. Further study is suggested to more accurately model human responses and behavioral heterogeneity, as well as to include more attributes of residential areas to estimate and improve the benefits of flood warnings. © 2016 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:48","2018-01-19 22:48:48","","316-332","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","simulation; Social sciences; decision support system; Decision support systems; probability; heterogeneity; Floods; Flood control; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Software agents; Artificial intelligence; Oil well flooding; accuracy assessment; Agent-based model; flood damage; flood forecasting; flood; warning system; Behavioral research; human behavior; Housing; residential location; Simulation; Behavioral heterogeneity; Emergency traffic control; Evacuation; Flood warning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Input data are gridded runoff values from a climate model, which are used by the Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) model to simulate flow rates within a vector river network. Peak flows in each river reach are then supplied to the AutoRoute model, which produces raster flood inundation maps. The coupled tool (AutoRAPID) is tested for the June 2008 floods in the Midwest and the April-June 2011 floods in the Mississippi Delta. RAPID was implemented from 2005 to 2014 for the entire Mississippi River Basin (1.2 million river reaches) in approximately 45 min. Discretizing a 230,000-km2 area in the Midwest and a 109,500-km2 area in the Mississippi Delta into thirty-nine 1° by 1° tiles, AutoRoute simulated a high-resolution ( 10 m) flood inundation map in 20 min for each tile. The hydrographs simulated by RAPID are found to perform better in reaches without influences from unrepresented dams and without backwater effects. Flood inundation maps using the RAPID peak flows vary in accuracy with F-statistic values between 38.1 and 90.9%. Better performance is observed in regions with more accurate peak flows from RAPID and moderate to high topographic relief. © 2016 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:50","2018-01-19 22:48:50","","280-299","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United States; discharge; streamflow; flow pattern; Rivers; computer simulation; Parallel Computation; Floods; flooding; Climate models; Flood control; runoff; Computational methods; mapping method; Oil well flooding; river basin; hydrograph; estimation method; spatial resolution; Mississippi River; Midwest; Rivers/streams; Mississippi River Basin; RAPID; AutoRAPID; Autoroute; backwater; Emergency response; Flood inundation mappings; Louisiana; Mississippi Delta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigate the effects of urbanization on flow duration curves (FDCs) and flow variability through a case study of eight watersheds that underwent different amounts of growth, in the Puget Sound region in Western Washington State, United States. We computed annual FDCs from flow records spanning 1960-2010 and, after accounting for the effects of precipitation, we conducted statistical trend analyses on flow metrics to quantify how key FDC percentiles changed with time in response to urbanization. In the urban watersheds, the entire FDC tended to increase in magnitude of flow, especially the 95th-99th percentile of the daily mean flow series, which increased by an average of 43%. Stream flashiness in urban watersheds was found to increase by an average of 70%. The increases in FDC magnitude and flashiness in urbanizing watersheds are most likely a result of increasing watershed imperviousness and altered hydrologic routing. Rural watersheds were found to have decreasing FDC magnitude over the same time period, which is possibly due to anthropogenic extractions of groundwater, and increasing stream flashiness, which is likely a result of reductions in base flow and increasing precipitation intensity and variability. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:48:53","2018-01-19 22:48:53","","493-507","","2","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Flow duration curve; United States; streamflow; urbanization; Urbanization; flow pattern; Groundwater flow; Groundwater; watershed; Watersheds; hydrological change; frequency analysis; Stream flow; baseflow; Electric network topology; Different frequency; Precipitation intensity; Washington [United States]; Washington State; flood routing; Flashiness; Hydrologic design; Puget Sound; Statistical trend analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, SWAT+ offers more flexibility than SWAT in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of SWAT+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. SWAT+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of SWAT+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of SWAT have already been enhanced in SWAT+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

To facilitate modeling at the NHDPlus catchment scale, we use an intermediate-level rainfall-runoff model rather than a complex process-based model. The hydrologic model within WaterFALL simulates rainfall-runoff processes for each catchment within a watershed and routes streamflow between catchments, while accounting for withdrawals, discharges, and onstream reservoirs within the network. The model is therefore distributed among each NHDPlus catchment within the larger selected watershed. Input parameters including climate, land use, soils, and water withdrawals and discharges are georeferenced to each catchment. The WaterFALL system includes a centralized database and server-based environment for storing all model code, input parameters, and results in a single instance for all simulations allowing for rapid comparison between multiple scenarios.

However, there is limited detailed and up-to-date information available on the cost of designing, constructing, and maintaining BMPs over their lifetime. The objective of this study is to analyze BMPs recently constructed by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to quantify their total cost per pound of phosphorus removed annually. A motivating factor for the study is recent changes to regulatory guidelines in Virginia which allow for full or partial substitution of purchased nutrient credits in lieu of constructing onsite BMPs to achieve compliance with stormwater quality regulations. Results of the analysis of nine BMPs found their cost ranged from $20,100 to $74,900, in 2014 dollars, per pound ($44,313-$165,126 per kg) of phosphorus removed. Based on these results and assuming current credit prices procured by VDOT, purchasing nutrient credits is a cost-effective option for the agency, especially when factoring in the cost of additional right of way for the BMP. Based on this finding, we expect compliance with stormwater quality regulations through credit purchases to become more widely used in Virginia. Moving forward, we suggest more direct tracking of BMP costs to support comparisons between BMP costs across a range of types and conditions to credit purchases for meeting stormwater regulations. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:02","2018-01-19 22:49:02","","131-143","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water resources; water management; water resource; runoff; Economics; Storm-water managements; Storms; Cost effectiveness; pollutant removal; Engineering geology; Storm sewers; Nutrients; cost analysis; Costs; best management practice; Best management practices; Stormwater control; phosphorus; Phosphorus; Virginia; Regulatory compliance; compliance; Cost benefit analysis; water economics; pollution tax; Sales; Transportation projects; Water resource economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A set of 769 weather stations located in Mexico was examined. The country was divided into 12 homogeneous rainfall regions via principal component analysis. A Pettitt test was conducted to perform a homogeneity analysis for detecting abrupt changes in mean rainfall levels, and a Mann-Kendall test was conducted to examine the presence of monotonically increasing/decreasing patterns in the data. In total, 14.4% of the annual series was deemed nonstationary. Fourteen percent of the samples were nonstationary in the winter and summer, and 9% were nonstationary in the spring and autumn. According to the results, the nonstationarity of some seasonal rainfall series may be associated with the presence of atmospheric phenomena (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation). A rainfall frequency analysis was performed for the nonstationary annual series, and significant differences in the return levels (Formula presented.) can be expected for the scenarios analyzed. The identification of areas that are more susceptible to changes in rainfall levels will improve water resource management plans in the country, and it is expected that these plans will take into account nonstationary theory. © 2016 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:05","2018-01-19 22:49:05","","144-157","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Principal component analysis; Rain; Water management; Water resources; rainfall; Climatic variability; trend analysis; climate change; water resource; spatiotemporal analysis; management practice; seasonal variation; resource management; precipitation (climatology); frequency analysis; annual variation; principal component analysis; Mexico [North America]; Atmospheric pressure; Temporal and spatial variability; weather station; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Change-points; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; North Atlantic oscillations; Pacific decadal oscillation; Rainfall frequency analysis; Water resource management plans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, operational streamflow forecasts made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service have relied on precipitation and snow water equivalent observations from Snow Telemetry (SNO℡) sites. We investigate whether also including SNO℡ soil moisture observations improve April-July streamflow volume forecast accuracy at 0, 1, 2, and 3-month lead times at 12 watersheds in Utah and California. We found statistically significant improvement in 0 and 3-month lead time accuracy in 8 of 12 watersheds and 10 of 12 watersheds for 1 and 2-month lead times. Surprisingly, these improvements were insensitive to soil moisture metrics derived from soil physical properties. Forecasts were made with volumetric water content (VWC) averaged from October 1 to the forecast date. By including VWC at the 0-month lead time the forecasts explained 7.3% more variability and increased the streamflow volume accuracy by 8.4% on average compared to standard forecasts that already explained an average 77% of the variability. At 1 to 3-month lead times, the inclusion of soil moisture explained 12.3-26.3% more variability than the standard forecast on average. Our findings indicate including soil moisture observations increased statistical streamflow forecast accuracy and thus, could potentially improve water supply reliability in regions affected by changing snowpacks. © 2016 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:07","2018-01-19 22:49:07","","179-196","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; Statistics; Streamflow forecast; United States; Utah; snowpack; soil moisture; streamflow; water supply; hydrological modeling; water content; Forecasting; watershed; Watersheds; Water supply; accuracy assessment; Hydrology; Soil moisture; Soils; Surface waters; precipitation (climatology); Monitoring; Stream flow; Conservation; Moisture; satellite altimetry; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; Surface water hydrology; Volumetric water content; Snow hydrology; meltwater; Natural resources conservation services; Soil physical property; Supply reliability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two SWAT models were created over two discrete time periods (1981-1990 and 2005-2014) for each watershed. National Land Cover Datasets 1992 and 2011 were, respectively, ingested into 1981-1990 and 2005-2014 models, along with corresponding weather data, to enable comparison of annual and seasonal runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and percolation between these two decades. Simulation results based on the calibrated models showed that surface runoff, soil water content, water yield, and percolation increased in all three watersheds. Elevated ET was also apparent, except in Skunk Creek watershed. Differences in annual water balance components appeared to follow changes in land use more closely than variation in precipitation amounts, although seasonal variation in precipitation was reflected in seasonal surface runoff. Subbasin-scale spatial analyses revealed noticeable increases in water balance components mostly in downstream parts of Bad River and Skunk Creek watersheds, and the western part of Upper Big Sioux River watershed. Results presented in this study provide some insight into recent changes in hydrological processes in South Dakota watersheds.

Loads of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus were calculated using the Ratio, L5, and L7 methods. Estimates of loads and their precision associated with short-term records of 5, 10, and 15 years were simulated by subsampling. The representativeness of the short-term loads was quantified as the standard deviation of the 20 realizations. The L7 method generally produced more realistic loads with the highest precision and representativeness. Differences between load estimates were shown to be associated with poor agreement between the data and the underlying model. The best method was shown to depend on the match between the model and functional and distributional characteristics of the data, rather than on the contaminant. Short-term load estimates poorly represented the long-term load estimate, and deviations frequently exceeded estimated imprecision. The results highlight there is no single preferred load calculation method, the inadvisability of “unsupervised” load estimation and the importance of inspecting concentration-flow, unit load-flow plots and regression residuals.

This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29 years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce flow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove flow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem influences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas flow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10 years.

To train the ANNs to capture interactions between land surface and various climatic patterns, data of 557 stations over the continental United States were collected. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the ANNs were able to identify input variables that directly affect the water and energy balance in root zone. The data important for RZSM retrieval in a large area included soil texture, surface soil moisture, and the cumulative values of air temperature, surface soil temperature, rainfall, and snowfall. The results showed that the ANNs had high skill in retrieving SM20 with a correlation coefficient above 0.7 in most cases, but were less effective at estimating SM50. The comparison of the ANNs showed that using soil texture data improved the model performance, especially for the estimation of SM50. It was demonstrated that the ANNs had high flexibility for applications in different climatic regions. The method was used to generate RZSM in North America using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture data, and achieved a spatial soil moisture pattern comparable to that of Global Land Data Assimilation System Noah model with comparable performance to the SMOS surface soil moisture retrievals.

Assignment of streams to classes is suggested as an initial step in the process of establishing ecological flow standards. We used two distinct hydroecological river classification systems available within North Carolina to evaluate the ability of a hydrologic model to assign the same classes as those determined by observed streamflows and to assess the transferability of such systems to ungaged streams. Class assignments were examined by rate of overall matches, rate of class matches, spatial variability in matches, and time period used in class assignment. The findings of this study indicate assignments of stream class: (1) are inconsistent among different classification systems; (2) differ between observed and modeled data; and (3) are sensitive to the period of record within observed data. One clear source of inconsistency/sensitivity in class assignments lies with the use of threshold values for metrics that distinguish stream classes, such that even small changes in metric values can result in different class assignments. Because these two hydroecological classification systems are representative of other classification systems that rely on quantitative decision thresholds, it can be surmised that the use of such systems based on stream flow metrics is not a reliable approach for guiding ecological flow determinations. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:21","2018-01-19 22:49:21","","30-41","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series analysis; United States; Water management; classification; simulation; streamflow; surface water; ecohydrology; time series analysis; Ecology; hydrological modeling; watershed; Water conservation; Surface waters; Soil conservation; Stream flow; hydrological regime; Surface water hydrology; North Carolina; Watershed management; Hydrologic metrics; stream classes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective was to compare two sources of interpolated precipitation data in terms of their effect on calibration and validation of two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. One model was a suburban watershed in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The precipitation sources were Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data on a 4-km grid and climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) data on a 38-km grid. The PRISM data resulted in a better fit to the calibration data (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] = 0.64, Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE] = 0.74, p-factor = 0.84, and r-factor = 0.43) than the CFSR data (NSE = 0.47, KGE = 0.53, p-factor = 0.67, and r-factor = 0.39). Validation results were similar. Sensitive parameters were similar in both the PRISM and CFSR models, but fitted values indicated more rapid groundwater flow to the streams with the PRISM data. The same comparison was made in the Big Creek watershed located approximately 1,000 km away, in central Louisiana. Results were similar with a more responsive groundwater system indicating PRISM data may produce better predictions of streamflow because of a more accurate estimate of rainfall within a watershed or because of a denser grid. Our study implies PRISM is providing a better estimate than CFSR of precipitation within a watershed when rain gauge data are not available, resulting in more accurate simulations of streamflows at the watershed outlet.

This method involved using 80th percentile linear quantile regressions to relate six flow metrics to the diversity of riffle-run fish and benthic Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness. All twelve flow-biology relationships were found to be significant, with both benthos and fish showing negative responses to ecodeficits and reductions in flow. The responses of benthic richness to reduced flows were consistent and generally greater than that of fish diversity. However, the riffle-run fish guild showed the greatest reductions in diversity in response to summer ecodeficits. The directional consistency and differential seasonal sensitivities of fish and invertebrates to reductions in flow highlight the need to consider seasonality when managing flows. In addition, all relationships were linear, and therefore do not provide clear thresholds to support ecological flow determinations and flow prescriptions to prevent the degradation of fish and invertebrate communities in North Carolina rivers and streams.

We tested the relationship between decreases in streamflow and Shannon-Weaver diversity index of fish species for four flow-based habitat guilds: riffle, riffle-run, pool-run, and pool in North Carolina. We found species that prefer shallow habitats, such as riffles and riffle-runs were the most sensitive to decreases in streamflow; whereas no significant relationships were found for pool or pool-run species. The sensitivity to decreases in streamflow was greatest during summer and fall, when streams are naturally lower. When all fish habitat guilds were included in the assessment of flow-biology relationships, there were no significant relationships to decreases in streamflow. As the sensitivity of fish to reductions in streamflow is not constant across habitat guilds, combining all fish species together for flow-biology analyses may greatly underestimate the response of fish species to decreases in flow and should be acknowledged when establishing ecological flows. © 2017 American Water Resources Association","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:30","2018-01-19 22:49:30","","56-66","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; streamflow; Fish; Ecology; Ecosystems; watershed; aquatic ecosystem; Water conservation; Lakes; habitat structure; Soil conservation; Stream flow; hydrological regime; North Carolina; Watershed management; Rivers/streams; fish; Aquatic ecology; Biology; Ecological flows; diversity index; Ecological integrity; Flow; Freshwater biota; guild structure; Shannon-Weaver diversity index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this importance, methods for quantifying the impact of water quality on water availability remain elusive. Here, we develop a new framework for incorporating the impact of water quality on water supply by modifying the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI). We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework by investigating the impact of high salinity waters on the availability of irrigation water for agriculture in Louisiana. The WaSSI was deconstructed into sectoral components such that the total available water supply could be reduced for a particular demand sector (agricultural irrigation in this example) based on available water quality information. The results for Louisiana highlight substantial impacts on water supply stress for farmers attributable to the landward encroachment of saline surface water and groundwater near the coast. Areas of high salinity near the coast also increased the competition for freshwater resources among the industrial, municipal, and agricultural demand sectors in the vicinities of the municipal areas of Lake Charles, Lafayette, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The framework developed here is easily adaptable for other water quality concerns and for other demand sectors, and as such can serve as a useful tool for water managers. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:35","2018-01-19 22:49:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; Water resources; Groundwater; Agriculture; Water; Water supply; Network function virtualization; Budget control; Irrigation; Surface waters; Salinity; Sustainable development; Fresh water resources; Saline water; Water availability; Agricultural irrigation; Coastal; Competition; Image quality; Index; Irrigation waters; Saline surface waters; Stresses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents a spatial distribution and temporal analysis of WC in Costa Rica from 2005 to 2015. In total, 719 WC were analyzed of which 54% were among private individuals and government. The largest urban areas and the Grande de Tárcoles Basin were identified as the main ""hot spot"" for the conflicts. WC were mainly caused by spills of wastewater, water pollution, water shortage, infrastructure damage, and flooding, and can be predicted using a multiple linear model including the population size and the number of hydro-meteorological events (HME) (R2 = 0.77). The identified HME also coevolved significantly with the changes in precipitation regimes (r = 0.67, p = 0.021). Our results suggest that there is a need to recognize that water infrastructure longevity across the country concatenates and amplifies WC, mainly in the most populated area located in the Central Valley.

In this study, besides examining North Dakota water management policies and activities, we also analyzed three datasets: the Bakken horizontal well completion data (2008-2014), North Dakota permitted water consumption data (2000-2014), and groundwater level and streamflow observations in western North Dakota (2000-2014). We found from 2008 to 2014, the annual total industrial water uses for Bakken shale oil development ranged between 0.5 and 10% of statewide total consumptive water use. The percentage increases were between 3.0 and 40% within the Bakken oil production region. The increased population of temporary oilfield service workers contributed additional domestic water use, which was equivalent to 15% of annual industrial water use for the shale oil development in the Bakken. Despite being in a semiarid region, the impact of Bakken development on regional water supply was limited because the water in the Bakken was adaptively managed and the region received on average over 20% more precipitation than normal during 2008-2014.

Beyond simulation of historical streamflows, it is similarly important to characterize the level of uncertainty in hydrologic estimates. In tandem with updates to Massachusetts Sustainable Yield Estimator, this work explores the application of global uncertainty estimates to daily streamflow simulations. Expanding on a method developed for deterministic modeling, this approach produces confidence intervals on daily streamflow developed through nonlinear spatial interpolation of daily streamflow using flow duration curves; the 95% confidence is examined. Archived cross-validations of daily streamflows from 66 watersheds in and around Massachusetts are used to evaluate an approach to uncertainty characterization. Neighboring sites are treated as ungauged, producing relative errors that can be resampled and applied to target sites. The method, with some modification, is found to provide appropriately narrow confidence intervals that contain 95% of the observed streamflows in cross-validation. Further characterizing uncertainty, multiday means of daily streamflow are evaluated. Working through cross-validation in Massachusetts, two- to three-month averages of daily streamflow show the best performance. These two approaches to uncertainty characterization inform how streamflow simulation produced for prediction in ungauged basins can be used for water resources management. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:42","2018-01-19 22:49:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; Water resources management; Uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Stream flow; Spatial interpolation; Confidence interval; Streamflow simulations; Produced Water; Deterministic modeling; Characterization; Prediction in ungauged basins; Uncertainty characterization; Ungauged basins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to assess climate change impacts on future drought conditions and water resources in the Chesapeake Bay (CB) watershed. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model were used to simulate a Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI), a Standardized Soil Moisture index (SSI), a Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), along with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models for both historical and future periods (f1: 2020-2049, f2: 2050-2079). The results of the SSI suggested that there was a general increase in agricultural droughts in the entire CB watershed because of increases in surface and groundwater flow and evapotranspiration. However, MPDSI and MSDI showed an overall decrease in projected drought occurrences due to the increases in precipitation in the future. The results of this study suggest that it is crucial to use multiple modeling approaches with specific drought indices that combine the effects of both precipitation and temperature changes. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:45","2018-01-19 22:49:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Hydrologic models; Water resources; Drought indices; Drought; Groundwater flow; Climate models; Groundwater; Watersheds; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil moisture; Barium compounds; Variable infiltration capacity models; Hydrometeorological variables; Palmer drought severity indices; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Multiple-model approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a considerable imbalance in the research focus on different hydrogeologic settings. More than 40% of the buffers are located in landscapes with surficial sand aquifers, whereas few buffers have been studied in glacial till and weathered bedrock landscapes which cover large areas. Annual groundwater fluxes for 29 of these sites ranged from <20 L/m/day for buffers on flat sand plains and uplands with fine-textured deposits to 50-1,200 L/m/day for many sites with upland sand aquifers. Despite a similar range of water fluxes, buffers in gently to moderately sloping landscapes with <4 m depths of sand sediments reached a 90% removal efficiency within 30-60 m while sites with >4 m depths required a 150-200 m width. The width for 90% efficiency in buffers with loamy sand and sandy loam sediments also increased from 10-20 m with <4 m sediment depths to 50-100 m for >4 m depths. Limited data for buffers with fine-textured sediments suggest that 90% of the nitrate flux was often depleted in a 10-20 m width. Groundwater flux did not have a significant relationship with nitrate removal percent per meter buffer width because of the variation in efficiency that occurred in buffers with similar fluxes in different hydrogeologic settings. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:47","2018-01-19 22:49:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; Sediments; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrology; Efficiency; Soils; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Sand; Ground-water hydrology; Rivers/streams; Groundwater fluxes; Hydrogeologic setting; Nitrate removal; Removal efficiencies; Riparian buffers; Weathered bedrock","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model represents a substantial step forward in our ability to predict hydrologic events in a consistent fashion across the entire U.S. Nevertheless, for these hydrologic results to be effectively communicated, they need to be put in context and be presented in a way that is straightforward and facilitates management-related decisions. The large amounts of data produced by the NWM present one of the major challenges to fulfill this goal. We created a cyberinfrastructure to store NWM results, ""accessibility"" web applications to retrieve NWM results, and a REST API to access NWM results programmatically. To demonstrate the utility of this cyberinfrastructure, we created additional web apps that illustrate how to use our REST API and communicate hydrologic forecasts with the aid of dynamic flood maps.

A number of organizations now provide flood inundation maps based on satellite remote sensing. These data products can efficiently and accurately provide the areal extent of a flood event, but do not provide floodwater depth, an important attribute for first responders and damage assessment. Here we present a new methodology and a GIS-based tool, the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET), for estimating floodwater depth based solely on an inundation map and a digital elevation model (DEM). We compare the FwDET results against water depth maps derived from hydraulic simulation of two flood events, a large-scale event for which we use medium resolution input layer (10 m) and a small-scale event for which we use a high-resolution (LiDAR; 1 m) input. Further testing is performed for two inundation maps with a number of challenging features that include a narrow valley, a large reservoir, and an urban setting. The results show FwDET can accurately calculate floodwater depth for diverse flooding scenarios but also leads to considerable bias in locations where the inundation extent does not align well with the DEM. In these locations, manual adjustment or higher spatial resolution input is required. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:49:58","2018-01-19 22:49:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Spatial resolution; Floods; Flood control; Oil well flooding; Remote sensing; Digital storage; Digital elevation model; Surveying; Reservoirs (water); Satellite remote sensing; Damage assessments; Damage detection; Depth Estimation; Hydraulic simulation; Large scale events; Water depth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we measured N and P concentrations in groundwater and available surface water at six randomly selected Iowa golf courses to assess the loading risk posed by these facilities to groundwater and local rivers. At each course, three shallow monitoring wells were installed, one each on representative tee, fairway, and rough locations. Wells and available surface water were sampled on eight occasions during 2015 and 2016. NO3-N concentrations were not detected above 1 mg/L at three of the six courses monitored in this study and the overall mean NO3-N concentration in Iowa golf courses was 2.2 mg/L. The mass of NO3-N recharged to groundwater averaged 3.3 kg/ha at the six courses, which represents approximately one-tenth of the NO3-N load exported by the watershed that contains the course and represented approximately 0.1 to 8% of the fertilizer N applied. Groundwater orthophosphorus concentrations averaged 0.13 mg/L and were similar to those measured in a variety of settings across Iowa. Study results should prove useful in evaluating nutrient contributions from golf courses in Midwestern states where nutrient reduction strategies are being pursued. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:00","2018-01-19 22:50:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Groundwater; Nitrates; Surface waters; Iowa; Nutrients; Nutrient concentrations; Nutrient reduction; Non-point source; Golf course; Limited information; Mass loading rate; Orthophosphorus; Recreational facilities; Sports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study's objective is to build real-time data-driven services that enable managers to rapidly estimate reservoir inflows from available data and models. We have tested the services using a case study of the Texas flooding events in the Lower Colorado River Basin in November 2014 and May 2015, which involved a sudden switch from drought to flooding. We have constructed two prediction models: a statistical model for flow prediction and a hybrid statistical and physics-based model that estimates errors in the flow predictions from a physics-based model. The study demonstrates that the statistical flow prediction model can be automated and provides acceptably accurate short-term forecasts. However, for longer term prediction (2 h or more), the hybrid model fits the observations more closely than the purely statistical or physics-based prediction models alone. Both the flow and hybrid prediction models have been published as Web services through Microsoft's Azure Machine Learning (AzureML) service and are accessible through a browser-based Web application, enabling ease of use by both technical and nontechnical personnel. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:02","2018-01-19 22:50:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Statistics; Colorado River Basin; Statistical modeling; Floods; Flood control; Forecasting; Web services; Oil well flooding; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Learning systems; Reservoir management; Managers; AzureML; Data-driven model; Hybrid prediction models; Physics-based modeling; Reservoir inflow; Short-term forecasts; Windows operating system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulation of challenging domains is often needed to guide flood management and environmental regulation agencies in operation and potential domain modifications. This work evaluates the ability of a two-dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic model to represent long-duration transient flows over a domain with highly heterogeneous roughness, geometric characteristics, and length scales through bed roughness representation. The domain includes 13 km of Cache Creek and the 14.5 km2 Cache Creek Settling Basin, which traps both sediment and mercury. Calibration under different bed roughness methods, validation, and modeling results of bathymetric modification scenarios are presented. The modeling approach's performance supports its application as a tool for management of similar domains, such as settling basins, leveed floodplains, and reservoirs. Accurate representation of flow dynamics can also inform environmental management that involves transport of sediments, nutrients, and heavy metals. This study found that a two-dimensional unsteady flow model can accurately represent long-duration transient flow in a large settling basin with highly heterogeneous characteristics without parsing of the domain or flow events simulated. © 2017 American Water Resources Association.","2017","2018-01-19 22:50:04","2018-01-19 22:50:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; CCHE2D; Environmental management; Rivers; Floods; Flood control; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrodynamics; Environmental regulations; Surface roughness; Bed roughness; Geometric characteristics; Heavy metals; Heterogeneous characteristic; Inundation; Settling tanks; Transition flow; Two dimensional unsteady flow; Two-dimensional simulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

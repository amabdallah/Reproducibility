For proactive planning, management, and adaptation of urban water infrastructure, a robust and comprehensive knowledge base is needed as decision support. This paper shows an integrated approach for decision support consisting of urban development modeling, climate projections, hydrodynamic sewer modeling, and Web-GIS visualization of interactive risk maps for pluvial flooding. The application on an Alpine case study demonstrates the benefits of such a combined consideration of different drivers. Climate projections of precipitation are based on four climate projections produced specifically for the Alps on a 0.1° grid. In order to obtain precipitation data with an adequate resolution for urban drainage modeling, the projections are downscaled using a statistical downscaling method. The results indicate a trend toward more intense heavy precipitation during summer until 2050. The effect of this trend can either be compensated or amplified by city development. It is shown that population growth on its own does not necessarily lead to a decrease of system performance, but that clever spatial planning can reduce negative effects. The visualization helps to involve stakeholders, politicians, and the public by illustrating model results for strategic planning and in workshops. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:43","2018-01-19 23:07:43","","","","12","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate projection; United States; Statistical downscaling; Visualization; decision support system; Decision support systems; Maps; urban drainage; Knowledge based systems; climate prediction; Population statistics; California; urban development; urban planning; Urban drainage systems; adaptive management; Urban growth; Drainage; Heavy precipitation; Urban drainage model; Alpine County; Changing environment; Constant pressures; Integrated approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using weighted least squares (WLS), model-simulated head losses are adjusted to minimize the sum of the squares of the corrections (differences between simulated and adjusted values) of simulated head losses under the constraints of head and flow measurements. Pipe roughness coefficients (Hazen-Williams C-factors) are computed by using the ratio of the simulated to adjusted head losses and refined by using boundary-fence and gross-error detection techniques. With the adjusted C-factors and head losses, pipe flows are computed to rectify nodal demands, which are limited in their boundary fences. After the demand multipliers are computed and filtered by using grosserror detection techniques, a large number of nodal demands make an advance. The loop of model simulation, head loss adjustment, and roughness and demand calibrations runs iteratively from different starting points of C-factor under multiple loading conditions, then realistic roughness and demands are achieved. The method was verified on two benchmark networks-a hypothetical network and a real network- by using noisy head and flow measurements. The results show that the method is effective for dual estimation of roughness and demand parameters. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:44","2018-01-19 23:07:44","","","","12","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","water management; Model calibration; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; calibration; least squares method; roughness; Iterative methods; demand analysis; pipe flow; Water piping systems; Fences; Flow measurement; Head loss; Roughness and demands; Water distribution networks; Weighted least squares","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The short-term hydropower model is used on a daily basis to dispatch the volume of water available to the turbines. This paper considers a stochastic short-term model. Uncertainty of inflows is represented with scenario trees, which are a discrete representation of the continuous distribution of the inflows. In addition, the complexity needed in the scenario trees to maximize the energy production in a rollinghorizon framework is investigated. Methods to generate scenario trees require input parameters that may be laborious to determine, and defining the structure of the tree in a real-time context is time consuming. Three comparisons are conducted to assess the complexity required in the scenario trees to obtain a good operational solution for the short-term hydropower optimization model. The first involves generating a set of scenario trees built from inflow forecast data over a rolling horizon. The second replaces the entire set of scenario trees by the median scenario. The third replaces the set of trees by scenario fans. The method used to build scenario trees requires three parameters: number of stages, number of child nodes at each stage, and aggregation of the period covered by each stage. The question of finding the best values of these parameters is formulated as a black-box optimization problem that maximizes energy production over the rolling horizon. Numerical experiments with real data on three hydropower plants in series suggest that using a set of scenario trees is preferable to using the median scenario, but using a fan of scenarios yields a comparable solution with less computational effort. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:45","2018-01-19 23:07:45","","","","12","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; Optimization; numerical model; Forestry; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; stochasticity; complexity; Trees (mathematics); Optimization modeling; Computational effort; Decision trees; hydroelectric power; Numerical experiments; Black-box optimization; Continuous distribution; Hydroelectric power; Operational solutions; Operations planning; Optimization models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This event poses a threat to public health and could result in political instability and social problems. After the contaminant and its source are detected, the main issues are consequences management and contaminant withdrawal from the water distribution network. To do this, several actions are required, including containing contaminant spread by closing valves and opening hydrants to flush out the polluted water. These actions may lead the network to a critical state in which the pressure of some nodes falls below the standard measure. In these network conditions, a pressure driven analysis of the water distribution network would be necessary. In this study, a combination of hydraulic simulation based on pressure driven analysis and particle swarm optimization is used to minimize the negative effects of contaminated water on public health as an immediate response after the contaminant entrance into water is detected. Based on the type of contaminant, two different emergency response strategies are introduced. Multiobjective optimization is performed when a nonharmful contaminant has entered the network. In this case, the main objectives are to minimize the impacts of contaminated water on consumers and the cost of operations. In another response strategy, reducing the time the network requires to return to a normal state is the objective of single-objective optimization when the contaminant is harmful. The proposed model was applied on the water distribution network of Sabzevar in northeastern Iran. The results proved the model's credibility and its applicability in real water distribution networks, even in cases of contaminant intrusion. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:46","2018-01-19 23:07:46","","","","12","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Iran; optimization; water supply; Multiobjective optimization; water management; Health risks; Mercury (metal); Water pollution; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; pollutant transport; Response strategies; public health; Public health; Evolutionary algorithms; pollution control; Razavi Khorasan; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Hydraulic simulation; Water distribution networks; Consequence management; Contaminant intrusions; Critical current density (superconductivity); Electric power distribution; Political instability; pollutant source; Pollution detection; pressure; Pressure-driven; Sabzevar; Single objective optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various parameters are examined to determine the most adequate parameter(s) for describing a WDS. The classification scheme is applied to a single hypothetical and 25 real systems. The primary indicator to classify a WDS function (transmission or distribution networks) is the length-weighted average pipe diameter. The average nodal demand and histogram of total length of each pipe diameter are applied as secondary measures. A new parameter, defined as the branch index (BI), is used to further classify a branched network by estimating the degree of branching within a WDS. The degree of looping and a second level of classification are based on the meshedness coefficient (MC), but only after the system is reduced to eliminate nonessential nodes. BI values are compared with other system-structure metrics in the literature including link density (LD), average node degree (AND), MC, and clustering coefficient (CC). To that end, Pearson correlation coefficients are computed across the set of other metrics for 26 systems.

In detail, it explores the operating conditions under which the installation of conventional mechanical pressure reducing valves (PRVs) or remotely real-time controlled (RTC) valves are cost effective compared to a scenario with no control. For a range of system sizes, hydraulic extended period simulations and empirical formulas were used to estimate leakage rates and pipe bursts, respectively, in numerous operational scenarios, including different precontrol leakage levels and demand patterns, the absence of pressure control, and the installation of a PRVor RTC valve. The total cost of the controlled system, including the installation cost of the control device, the flow-dependent operation and maintenance (O & M) cost, and the pipe burst repair cost over the planning horizon, was compared with the water-related O & M and pipe burst repair costs of the uncontrolled system. The results pointed out that no pressure controls are needed if leakage and the variable O & M cost of water are low. When these variables are high, remote RTC is attractive, especially when the demand pattern is peaked and the system is large. For more moderate cost and leakage, a conventional PRV may be better than RTC, especially in small systems and for relatively smooth demand patterns. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:00","2018-01-19 23:08:00","","","","12","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","distribution system; Water supply systems; pipe; Cost effectiveness; economic analysis; Real time control; Costs; Water distributions; leakage; Economic analysis; Extended period simulations; installation; Leakage reduction; Mechanical pressure; Operation and maintenance; Operational scenario; Pressure control; pressure field; Pressure reducing valves; Pressure regulators; Repair; Suid herpesvirus 1; Uncontrolled systems; Valves (mechanical)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate change on the water budgets of the Nuuanu area watersheds (NAW), Oahu, Hawaii, and most importantly, on the potential of water harvesting from Nuuanu Reservoir 4 (NR4). The harvest approach concerns water diversion from the reservoir for artificially supplementing groundwater recharge through injection into the subsurface. Following calibration and validation at multiple streamflow gauging stations across the watershed, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was applied to assess current and future water availability in the NR4. Multiple statistical evaluation criteria were used to demonstrate that SWAT adequately reproduced the observed daily streamflow hydrographs at all stations. Climate change analyses used the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The reported analysis suggests that the water-budget components of the NAW will generally be adversely affected by climate change. Compared to the baseline of 35 years, the amount of water available from the NR4 for harvesting will decrease by as much as 27%, and the corresponding outflow values will decrease by as much as 37%. Despite future temperature increases, the actual monthly watershed-scale evapotranspiration will decrease because of the overall decrease in rainfall and soil-moisture availability. Rainfall has the dominant control over the magnitude of water-budget components and harvesting compared with temperature and solar radiation. This study presents a blueprint for surface-water-harvesting scenarios, which may become a necessity across the Pacific and other islands in the future. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:02","2018-01-19 23:08:02","","","","11","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Runoff; Floods; Flood control; Groundwater; Land use; Water; Watersheds; Soil and water assessment tool; Water supply; Water conservation; Budget control; Soil moisture; Soils; Landforms; Surface waters; Calibration and validations; Harvesting; Reservoirs (water); Ground water recharge; Stream flow; Recharging (underground waters); Water budget components; Water injection; Hawaii; Soil moisture availability; Statistical evaluation; Water harvesting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This societal relevance simultaneously heightens the need for rigorous performance and dissemination of scientific work and invites caution from experts who are communicating within what is likely a politicized public conversation.

Participants cite face-to-face interactions and trust-based relationships as important in their interactions, which is consistent with research about effective communication. However, few participants highlight techniques specific to communicating about water as it relates to oil and gas or about controversial issues generally. Participants also rarely use communication science related to objective setting, framing, and measuring success for improvement, likely in part because of a lack of evidence-based training. In many cases, interviewees expressed attitudes consistent with the deficit model of scientific communication, which holds that presentation of scientific facts will change public opinion. This model has been shown to be relatively ineffective.

A good pump schedule is one that reduces pump energy and maintenance costs without worsening the overall system performance. Because of the nonlinearity of the hydraulic energy balance equations and the complexity of water distribution networks, pump scheduling problems cannot be easily solved by hand, especially in the general case of a network with multiple tanks and pumps/pumping stations. A number of approaches exist in the literature addressing the trade-off between effectiveness (i.e., optimality of schedules generated) and computational efficiency, but there seems to be no ideal solution. In this paper, an effective and efficient optimization method, the iterative extended lexicographic goal programming (iELGP), is developed to solve a least-cost pump scheduling problem. The method is tested on two multitank networks. The results obtained demonstrate that by using the iELGP method, an optimal pump schedule can be obtained with high computational efficiency which makes the method suitable for real-time application. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:05","2018-01-19 23:08:05","","","","11","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; water supply; Multiobjective optimization; Economic and social effects; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; numerical method; Computational efficiency; Scheduling; Costs; Iterative methods; Pumps; Optimization method; Real-time application; Water distribution networks; High energy prices; Hydraulic energy; Ideal solutions; Lexicographic goal programming; Linear programming; Maintenance cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of the heterogeneity of the multiple decision variables and the complicated way they interact through the multiple objectives (some complimentary and some conflicting), it is not possible to fully automate the simultaneous sectorization, rehabilitation, and operational optimization. Therefore, a multistage approach is used where engineering judgment and network graph simplification and visualization tools are used to find a good feasible solution that serves as a first guess for further optimization of sectors and operational settings, to achieve feasible solutions with better cost of implementation, demand similarity among DMAs, and better pressure uniformity in operations.

This paper classifies these multiple uncertainties and develops a decision framework that combines simulation for probabilistic uncertainty, scenario analysis for deep uncertainty, and multistage decision analysis for uncertainties reduced over time with additional information. This framework is applied to a case from Melbourne, Australia, where a drought from 1997 to 2009 prompted investment in a $5 billion desalination plant completed in 2012 after the drought ended. The results show opportunities for significant reduction in capital investment using flexible design. Building no infrastructure is best in most simulations. However, in 10% of simulations, building no infrastructure leads to regret of greater than $10 billion compared with a small, flexible desalination plant. Scenario analysis for deep uncertainties underlines the significant impact of assumptions about the future and also on value judgments about the cost of water scarcity in evaluating infrastructure performance. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:16","2018-01-19 23:08:16","","","","10","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Decision making; water supply; Drought; Uncertainty analysis; Victoria [Australia]; decision making; Water supply; scenario analysis; Investments; uncertainty analysis; Population statistics; urban planning; water demand; infrastructure planning; Water infrastructure; Water supply infrastructures; Urban growth; Decision-making frameworks; Desalination; infrastructural development; Melbourne; Multistage decisions; Probabilistic uncertainty; Short-term variations; Water availability and demand","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study focuses on the fixed head hydropower operation problem considering power shortages, which is classified as a large-scale nonlinear constrained optimization problem with a set of complex operational constraints. In order to efficiently solve this problem, a novel quadratic programming (QP) model is developed, in which the goal is to find the optimal hourly operational policy for all hydropower plants in a system so as to minimize the sum of squared energy deficits over the scheduling horizon. The results of a ten-reservoir hydropower system show that the proposed approach can efficiently find better solutions than several previous optimization methods for energy deficit reduction.

From the results of bivariate frequency analysis, a unique broken-line model is derived under multiple scenarios with the given return periods for the evaluation of water supply. The proposed method is applied to a total of five major dams in Korea.

A report has identified hot spots of likely conflict over water in the western United States by 2025; therefore, unexploited sources of water must be identified to reduce these problems. Direct potable reuse (DPR) is a supply-side approach that can improve sustainability and reliability of water supplies by recovering drinking water from wastewater. Most potable reuse research has focused on large, coastal communities, which have different opportunities and constraints regarding water rights, treatment technologies, regulatory considerations, and costs than inland communities in arid environments. It is concluded that the challenges associated with the coastal and inland contexts are very different, and information regarding DPR suitability generated for coastal communities may not be applicable to inland communities. This paper identifies the unique challenges associated with the technical, regulatory, and economic aspects of DPR in inland communities.

Within the mid-Columbia River system, there is currently a lack of specific solutions for predicting how coordinated operational decisions can mitigate the impacts of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation while satisfying multiple additional policy and hydropower generation objectives. In this study, a reduced-order TDG uptake equation is developed that predicts tailrace TDG at seven hydropower facilities on the mid-Columbia River. The equation is incorporated into a general multiobjective river, reservoir, and hydropower optimization tool as a prioritized operating goal within a broader set of system-level objectives and constraints. A test case is presented to assess the response of TDG and hydropower generation when TDG supersaturation is optimized to remain under state water-quality standards. Satisfaction of TDG as an operating goal is highly dependent on whether constraints that limit TDG uptake are implemented at a higher priority than generation requests. According to the model, an opportunity exists to reduce TDG supersaturation and meet hydropower generation requirements by shifting spillway flows to different time periods.

However, to apply this method to real WDS, various system properties should be taken into account to ensure efficient water supply. The battle of water networks district meter areas (BWNDMA) is a challenging problem that requires the redesign of the E-Town city network in Colombia. The water utility is looking to repartition the network into manageable DMAs while supplying future demands, keeping minimum and maximum pressures, improving water quality, operating the network at uniform low pressures, balancing water sources, and meeting their seasonal production capabilities. The problem is stated as a multiobjective optimization problem with DMA partitioning being one of eight equal-weighted objectives. They may be reached by (1) closing, opening, or replacing existing pipes, (2) adding parallel pipes, (3) managing storage tanks, pressure valves, and flow-control valves, and (4) utilizing pumps in the dry season. With no known analytical methodology to optimize such a large mixed-integer nonlinear problem, a major difficulty is to find a feasible solution; therefore, a multistage classic engineering approach was taken. First, source allocation and general design were carried out for the operational zones. Then, tank volumes were adjusted to meet their constraints. At this stage, DMAs were introduced to meet pressure regulations. Finally, detailed design and fine-tuning of the operations were carried out.

To address listing of winter-run Chinook salmon under the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began operating a temperaturecontrol device (TCD) on Shasta Dam in 1997 that enabled selective withdrawal of reservoir outflows for control of downstream water temperatures while maximizing power generation. However, effectiveness of TCD operations for addressing fisheries concerns under hydroclimate variability is unknown. Stochastic methods to generate synthetic extreme hydroclimate conditions were combined with hydrodynamic modeling of reservoir operations and interactions with reservoir managers to examine the TCD's ability to meet downstream temperature objectives. Model simulations suggest that TCD withdrawal schedules could reduce outflow temperature target exceedances when compared with more traditional dam operations such as solely hypolimnetic or epilimnetic releases.

The results also show that the existence of economies of scale for WaSCs and WoCs, as well as integration economies between water and sewerage services, could potentially create substantial cost savings.

Interbasin water transfer, in which water is transmitted from a basin with high water availability to a neighbor basin with high water use, has been proposed as a solution to water scarcity. Because of the various decision-making factors, studies of interbasin water transfer projects have been presented as complex and difficult in the literature. In this paper, an optimum design for the capacities of the Behesht-Abad interbasin water transfer system, from the upstream Karoun basin to the Gavkhooni basin in central Iran, has been studied using a simulation-optimization approach in which particle swarm optimization (PSO) is coupled with the river basin simulation model, to find the optimum values for decision variables. In another approach, by use of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) and quantifying selected criteria in the source and target basins, the most beneficial scenario for water transfer is selected by prioritizing six possible alternatives. Results obtained by both PSO-MODSIM and MCDM approaches are close to each other and show that under conditions consistent with recent drought years, the optimum capacity of the water transfer tunnel is obtained to be a maximum of 45% of the capacity under conditions consistent with long-term historical discharges of the rivers. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:22","2018-01-19 23:09:22","","","","9","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Iran; Water resources; Water resources management; design; optimization; simulation; water resource; multicriteria analysis; decision making; basin management; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Inter-basin water transfer; Beheshtabad River; Capacity design; Chahar Mahall va Bakhtiari; Inter-basin water transfer systems; Multi criteria decision making; River basin simulation model; Simulation optimization; Temporal and spatial distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the Ludlow watershed in northern Kentucky as a case study, the main objective of this paper was to identify the most cost-effective arrangement of BMPs in reducing surface runoff. A simulation program was employed to model the hydrologic conditions in the Ludlow watershed under the current and future climate conditions and to identify the most cost-effective BMP arrangement. The results show that the simulation program is an effective tool in simulating a small watershed. Indeed, BMPs are instrumental in reducing surface runoff even when the future climate becomes drier. The most cost-effective BMP arrangement is to install two infiltration trenches and one bioretention in the watershed.

Compared to other sampling methods present in the scientific literature, it is based on practical considerations of network topology and operation. This aspect confers upon the procedure lightness from a computational viewpoint. Sampling was carried out on four variables, namely, injection location, starting time, mass rate, and duration. The injection location was sampled as a function of distance from the source based on network connectivity. A single starting time was selected inside each network operating phase, during which pipe-water discharges were quite constant. One single mass rate was selected as significant, considering the linearity of the contaminant advection-reaction equation under specific conditions. In fact, owing to this linearity, the results of quality simulations associated with a generic mass rate can be easily derived from those associated with the selected mass rate. Finally, a single (small) duration was sampled. In fact, a long duration event can be simply regarded as the sum of various short-duration events. The procedure was tested in two case studies of different complexity. As evidence of the sampling effectiveness, the results of the optimal sensor placement did not vary significantly when the sampled contamination events were used inside the optimization, instead of the totality of possible contamination events. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:51","2018-01-19 23:09:51","","","","9","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; optimization; water supply; Water pollution; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; sensor; sampling; Sampling; Complex networks; water pollution; Sensors; Advection-reaction equations; Contamination events; Long duration events; Network connectivity; Network design; Optimal sensor placement; Scientific literature; Short duration events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A hydraulic valve is expected to minimize problems with transients, although the study also applies to other valves. The control is done by using a controller that typically depends on tunable parameters, which are laborious to determine. A parameter-less controller is simpler because there are no parameters to tune. Such an existing P-controller, based on the flow in a pressure control valve being known, is enhanced from assuming constant flow to be valid for variable flow.

Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, is an example of a city where water supply security has come under increasing pressure due to population growth, climate variability, and climate change, as well as emerging environmental needs. In order to address this issue, the South Australian government has committed to implementing IUWM principles through a number of actions including an initiative to integrate alternative water source options for metropolitan Adelaide, called the Urban Water Blueprint. This study is part of the optimal water resources mix (OWRM) project, which was initiated by the South Australian government through the Goyder Institute for Water Research to inform the development of the Urban Water Blueprint. In this study, a multiobjective optimization-based IUWM approach is applied to Adelaide to identify its optimal water supply portfolios and, in turn, to inform policy aimed at prioritizing the development of different types of potential water resources. These sources include traditional water sources, such as surface water from reservoirs and rivers, as well as alternative water sources, such as desalinated sea water, harvested stormwater, and reclaimed wastewater. In addition to the traditional objectives of minimizing economic cost and energy consumption (or the associated greenhouse gas emissions) and maximizing reliability, the impact of stormwater and wastewater discharge on receiving waters is also considered. The results demonstrate that for Adelaide, the optimal mix of sources contains water from traditional surface water sources, harvested stormwater, and reclaimed wastewater. Traditional surface water is a low-cost and low-energy source; reclaimed wastewater is likely to have significant environmental benefits in the long term. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:08","2018-01-19 23:10:08","","","","9","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Climate change; Water management; Water resources; water supply; Multiobjective optimization; water management; Climate variability; water resource; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; wastewater treatment; Water supply; urban area; identification method; Storms; Surface waters; resource scarcity; Population statistics; stormwater; Adelaide; South Australia; Wastewater treatment; Wastewater reclamation; Integrated urban water management; governance approach; Energy utilization; Alternative water sources; Environmental benefits; Environmental needs; Reclaimed wastewater; Reclamation; Surface water sources; Wastewater discharge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Urban nutrient loadings are expected to increase and become more variable under climate change (CC). In this study, a water quality simulation model (SWMM), land cover data layers, and mathematical programming models were used to compare costs of abating nutrient loads under CC in the Difficult Run Watershed located in Fairfax County, Virginia. Predicted costs of abating mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended sediment (TSS) loadings under current climate conditions were compared with those for CC under certainty with a Cost Minimization Model and under uncertainty with a Safety First Model. Total nitrogen loadings abatement had the highest cost followed by TP and TSS abatement in that order. Costs of controlling TP and TSS increased with CC, whereas there was little change in TN control costs. Introducing uncertainty of loadings caused control costs to increase substantially for all three pollutants. The preferred pollutant control strategy was urban stream restoration.

These goals can be achieved through the implementation of stormwater control measures (SCMs) such as green roofs and permeable pavements. The effectiveness of SCMs can be influenced not only by their design but also by their location. The present study applies multi-objective evolutionary optimization and Monte Carlo simulation approaches to help identify nearoptimal locations of green roofs and permeable pavements in the catchment scale. The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II was connected to the stormwater management model (SWMM) to identify the location of SCMs and characterize the tradeoffs between flow regime alteration and implementation costs. The impact of implementing SCMs is measured by peak flow, runoff volume, and the hydrologic footprint residence (HFR). The HFR is a new stormwater metric that represents dynamics of inundated areas and residence time of flood waves throughout downstream segments. The approach was tested in an illustrative case study of an 11.7-ha urban catchment divided into five subcatchments. The results indicate that locating SCMs in downstream subcatchments can reduce peak flow more effectively, whereas SCMs placed in upstream subcatchments better reduce the HFR. The proposed methodology can help stormwater managers to better assess the combined performance of LID-SCMs in different hydrologic scales and generate guidelines for prioritizing the implementation or retrofitting of urban areas with green infrastructure. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:20","2018-01-19 23:10:20","","","","9","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; optimization; genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; computer simulation; Monte Carlo analysis; Floods; Catchments; Storms; Genetic algorithms; Low impact development; Storm sewers; Green roof; Pavements; Roofs; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Location; Urban growth; hydrological regime; peak flow; Hydrologic footprint residence; pavement; Permeable pavements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this approach, a water distribution network is first mapped on to a weighted undirected graph, and its strength is measured by an extended modularity by a random walk strategy. Then, the Louvain algorithm is employed for network partitioning based on the modularity. Finally, boundary pipes between DMAs are determined by applying an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the number of boundary pipes and maximize the network pressure and water age uniformity.

Within Los Angeles and its hundreds of water agencies, the capacity to adapt to future changes is influenced by laws, institutions, and hydrogeology. This paper presents a systems analysis of urban water management in metropolitan Los Angeles County to assess opportunities for increasing local water reliance. A network flow model was developed to investigate management tradeoffs across engineered, social, and environmental systems. With an aggressive regional demand target, increased stormwater capture (300%), and prioritized water reuse from existing facilities, imported water supplies can be cut by 30% while maintaining landscapes, economic productivity, and groundwater resources. Further reducing imports (by 40-50%) is possible through actions to promote additional reuse, recharge, conservation, and groundwater access.

To measure different aspects of water supply systems in terms of reliability, resilience, and vulnerability, a suite of five metrics are considered: water supply reliability, mean and maximum deficits of water supply, and mean and maximum durations of water shortage. Results obtained in this study reveal that both conflicting and synergetic relationships exist between reliability and resilience (mean deficit of water supply), and between vulnerability (mean duration of water shortage) and resilience (mean deficit of water supply) in different regions of the objective space. A more complete picture of the relationships among reliability, resilience, and vulnerability than reported in the prior literature is provided in this paper thanks to the use of many-objective analysis.

A novel two-level Markov chain Monte Carlo particle filter method for joint estimation of demand and roughness is proposed in this paper. First, an improved particle filter with ensemble Kalman filter modification to proposal density is adopted to track the non-Gaussian system dynamics and estimate demands. Then, the improved particle filter for demand estimation is nested into the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation for roughness estimation. The method is very capable of quantifying the uncertainties associated with estimated or predicted values without requiring any assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity or any derivatives to be calculated. A strong nonlinear benchmark network with synthetically generated field data is utilized to validate the performance of this method.

These models can be powerful tools for examining potential future changes in water resources systems, including the effects of climate change, socioeconomic changes, and infrastructural and policy responses to water resource management challenges. In this paper, the WEM models used to answer water economy questions are classified into two general categories on the basis of their structure: network-based (simulation or optimization) hydroeconomic models, and economywide (inputoutput or computable general equilibrium) models. This paper highlights the primary differences in the applications and interpretations obtained using these approaches, analyzes the distribution of questions that differentWEMs have been used to answer, and discusses previous work and efforts to integrate across model types. Findings suggest that additional efforts are needed to more realistically account for the range and complexity of linking water systems and society, particularly regarding ecology and water quality, and the food and energy sectors. Additionally, the broader economic impacts of water-related processes, for example those related to interregional trade dynamics, the distribution of income, and migration, should be investigated further. In effect, because of the inherent complexity in the economic dynamics underlying many water systems, such tools can challenge intuition and provide critical insights that are relevant to more effective management of transboundary water resources and related sectors. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:17","2018-01-19 23:11:17","","","","8","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; modeling; optimization; water availability; computer simulation; Climate models; water resource; numerical model; Economic and social effects; Economics; river basin; Complex networks; water demand; Waterresource management; River basins; Water resources systems; Spatial and temporal scale; Waterworks; water economics; Computable general equilibrium; General equilibrium; Input output model; input-output analysis; Transboundary water resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flooding can cause failure of infrastructure, which could result in seriously interrupting or even paralyzing the daily life in those communities. Manhattan in New York City is a coastal metropolitan area surrounded by several waterbodies. Interactions among these waterbodies at the time of flooding significantly affect the water level fluctuation. Devastation caused by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 is evidence of how interconnected NYC waterbodies amplified the adverse effects on the shoreline and the coastal system. Proposing models to study the coastal areas where there are interactions among waterbodies that affect water level variations, and results in infrastructure vulnerability to flooding, is a challenge. In response to this challenge, the main objectives of this study are to simulate water-level variation in the New York Bay (lower Manhattan) during storm events, and to investigate the effect of storms on coastal infrastructure. For this purpose, by using the concept of system dynamics (SD), a dynamic simulation model (DSM) has been formulated to model the interactions among the water entities of the system for normal water level (harmonic tide) simulation. In the DSM framework, the governing equations among different waterbodies are used based on flood (forward) and ebb (backward) effects in each tidal cycle. The simulated water level by DSM is then fine-tuned using an artificial neural network (ANN) model, providing a better match between simulation results and the observed values. An envelope graph is then developed to simulate surge elevation at the time of storm in a representative station (Battery Park south of lower Manhattan). A loadresistance concept has been developed to investigate the effect of flood (storm) as load on the infrastructure resistance. Then, the probability of coastal infrastructure failure to flood load is determined. Results show the significant value of using a coupled SD-ANN platform to simulate water-level fluctuations at the time of storm. The developed load-resistance concept is a framework to link the simulated storm (load) to the resistance of lifelines (infrastructure) of coastal communities. This study targeted two important growing concerns in the coastal communities that can be further integrated, replicated, and extended in this and other similar settings. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:23","2018-01-19 23:11:23","","","","8","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; computer simulation; Floods; flooding; Neural networks; numerical model; System theory; System Dynamics; Artificial neural network models; infrastructure; Storms; Water levels; coastal zone; Coastal zones; water level; storm; Water infrastructure; loading; New York [United States]; Infrastructure vulnerabilities; Load resistances; New York [New York (STT)]; Water level variations; Water-level fluctuation; Waterbodies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study develops a systemwide event detection algorithm that integrates the alarm information from localized model-based EDAs at individual monitoring stations with the probabilistic contamination source identification algorithm to estimate the probability that a node-time pair may have been contaminated. An alarm threshold can be set on the resulting contamination probabilities, which results in a systemwide EDA that takes advantage of integrating the distributed detection at all sensors rather than relying on single sensors. The systemwide EDA was evaluated with two injection scenarios simulated at two different injection locations to assess performance when all sensors observed the event versus when only one sensor observed the event. The results showed that for both injection locations and both injection scenarios, the integrated systemwide EDA outperformed the use of only the localized EDA for a series of detection thresholds based upon a range of false positive rates.

This paper develops a probabilistic analysis and evaluation framework based on Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods for prior-known evaluation of transient nodal demand effects in WDS. An expression of the demand impact factor (DIF) is first proposed for indicating the influence of nodal demand effect based on a Lagrangian nodal demand model and implemented in the developed evaluation framework. Parameter sensitivity analysis is then conducted to evaluate the relevance and importance of the DIF to transient modeling and analysis in WDS. The results indicate that the DIF is highly relevant to the inherent attributes and initial steady state of the system, which can thus be used to facilitate the prior-known evaluation of the importance and influence of nodal demand effect in WDS.

Accurate estimation of a minimum required head at the demand node is critical for properly calculating the resilience indexes.

Two optimization cases are constructed to analyze the trade-off changes: a base case with no water transfer that considers four objectives, i.e., minimizing industry water shortage, minimizing agriculture water shortage, minimizing water spillage, and maximizing ecological satisfaction; and a future postconstruction case that considers an additional objective to minimize the amount of water transferred. Results obtained from the case study show increasing water transfer substantially reduces the intensity of the competition between industrial and agricultural water shortages, and the objective trade-offs among water spillage, ecological satisfaction, and agricultural shortage index are substantially changed because of water transfer. In addition, the amount of water transferred with high efficiency regarding each objective is identified, and three solutions of different orders of magnitude in diverted water have been recommended for informed decision making considering efficiency and benefit.

This research employs successive linear approximation methods, based on linear programming and mixed integer linear programming, in a simulation-optimization framework to explore an alternative leak detection methodology for urban water distribution networks based on pressure measurements. The methods attempt to minimize the absolute differences between observed and simulated pressure values at the sensors to determine a linear combination of leaks that most closely approximates the observed pressure pattern. Steady-state and time-varying models of differing complexity (from small published networks to a 27,000-node network for a U.S. utility) were used to test the method. Results are presented to illustrate the method's effectiveness under different conditions. The methods are shown to work well when pervasive pressure data and hydraulic models representing true operational conditions are available. The methods developed in this work are not intended to replace traditional leak detection methods; rather, they are meant to work in concert with available methods to more accurately and efficiently isolate leak locations and reduce water loss. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:12:13","2018-01-19 23:12:13","","","","8","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Integer programming; linear programing; Hydraulic models; water resource; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; leakage; detection method; pressure; Simulation optimization; Absolute difference; Approximation theory; Leak detection; Linear approximation method; Linear combinations; Mixed integer linear programming; Operational conditions; Pressure measurement; Time-varying models; Urban water distribution networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To forecast monthly inflow values, an improved support vector machine (SVM) model was constructed using meteorological and hydrological data as inputs. To improve forecasting accuracy, this improved model, along with a basic SVM, was coupled to two data preprocessing methods: empirical mode decomposition and singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Comparisons between all the models revealed that the improved SSA-SVM model had superior predictive accuracy. China's Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) was taken as a case study for combining the improved SSA-SVM forecasting model with an operation model. A multiobjective ecological reservoir operation model was created for the TGR and optimized using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The simulation results indicate that the proposed coupled model for the TGR would outperform actual TGR operation; multiobjective ecological operations using inflow forecasting could alleviate water shortages.

Despite the fact that operational schemes in the transition periods are critical and of great interest to reservoir operation practice, the problem has received little attention in the literature. This paper presents a study on cluster analysis for identifying patterns of operational schemes during transition periods. The test case corresponds to ten major reservoirs of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) in the United States. The operation horizon consists of two weeks during which the objectives of the reservoir system are shifted based on seasonal consideration for fish migration and survival. An optimization model based on an evolutionary algorithm is used to derive the optimal operational schemes under various inflow scenarios. A K-Spectral Centroid algorithm (K-SC) is applied to the resulting operational schemes to find clusters of the schemes based on similarities of their temporal shapes. By investigating the relations between the clusters and the inflow scenarios, general patterns of operational schemes are identified. The analyses offer insights into the operational schemes during the transition period and broaden the understanding of short-term reservoir operation with shifting operational objectives. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:12:32","2018-01-19 23:12:32","","","","8","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Reservoir operation; United States; algorithm; cluster analysis; optimization; Optimization; Cluster analysis; Optimization modeling; multireservoir system; Multi-reservoir systems; Centroid algorithm; Ecological benefits; Operational patterns; Operational schemes; Shifting objectives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The demands placed on and revenues generated for these infrastructures are impacted by human interactions, such as price elasticity and population dynamics. The consequences of these human-infrastructure interactions may be seen in shrinking cities, where chronic population decline has led to underfunded and underutilized infrastructures. This paper evaluates human-water and wastewater systems sector interdependencies in shrinking cities to explore water demand, utility revenues, public support, and payoff periods for retooling alternatives. To assess the dynamic behavior of the water sector systems, a hybrid framework is used that incorporates agent-based and system dynamics modeling. Driving the approach is data gathered from published and publicly available literature, two case studies, and a survey deployed to residents of 21 U.S. shrinking cities. This study quantifies the endogenous, physical interdependencies and the exogenous, complex human interactions. The epistemic uncertainty associated with human-infrastructure interactions is explored by incorporating stochastic parameters rather than the traditional deterministic parameters. Furthermore, the framework enables the assessment of interdependencies with parameters tailored to a city's unique characteristics. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:12:38","2018-01-19 23:12:38","","","","8","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","water supply; Uncertainty analysis; Water supply; urban area; infrastructure; Stochastic systems; human activity; Population statistics; Water infrastructure; Epistemic uncertainties; population decline; Human infrastructure; Infrastructure systems; Population decline; Shrinkage; Stochastic parameters; System dynamics model; Water and wastewater","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solving the problem entails finding the best sensor locations that optimize a criterion such as detection rate or time to detection. Few methods exist concerning sensor placement that optimize the result of a source identification method. This paper fills the gap by coupling an adjoint source identification method and a Monte Carlo sensor placement algorithm. The first one is treated through the use of a backtracking algorithm. It uses binary responses at sensors to calculate the ranked list of potential contamination location nodes and contamination times. A criterion is then defined based on the source identification accuracy and specificity. Finally, two optimizing methods that maximize this criterion are proposed: a greedy algorithm and a local search algorithm, which are both coupled with a Monte Carlo method to give the locations of sensors that are the best suited for allocating the source of a contamination.

A shortlist of nine water grid operating options have been identified, which are optimal in terms of minimizing total operational cost, maximizing water security, and minimizing spills from reservoirs, over a 5-year period. This study assesses the performance of each of these nine operating options against a wider set of 18 criteria reflecting cost, supply reliability, environmental flow, water quality, reservoir spill, and water security concerns. The weighted summation multicriteria analysis technique is used to combine and rank performance of the nine operating options against the 18 criteria. An operating option is selected that performs best on average across the 18 criteria and four scenarios of preference weights.

In this paper, multiobjective and single-objective optimization procedures to optimally locate sensors in sewer systems are proposed, tested, and compared. The multiobjective procedures include objective functions related to information theory (IT procedure), detection time and reliability (DR procedure), and a combination of them (IT_DR procedure). The single-objective procedures include a greedy-based objective function (GR procedure) and a merged objective function (DR_IT_GR procedure). The procedures show a similar performance when applied on a small network, whereas in a real system, the results show that (1) the IT-based method can be effectively used as a filtering technique(2) the DR_IT_GR procedure outperforms the other multiobjective onesand (3) the GR procedure is very efficient in finding the Pareto extreme solutions. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:48","2018-01-19 23:13:48","","","","7","143","","Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; optimization; water quality; water management; Optimization; sensor; sewer network; Sewers; Quality control; Objective functions; Wastewater treatment; Single objective optimization; Receiving water bodies; Sensors; Filtration; Efficient managements; Filtering technique; Illicit intrusion; Information theory; Reliability theory; Treatment plants; Wastewater quality; water treatment plant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, knowledge on future changes in irrigation demand in the context of climate change is very important for long-term planning and management of water resources of the region. This paper investigated the changes in irrigation water demand in an intensive irrigated area of Malaysia under climate change scenario. Global circulation models (GCMs) outputs are downscaled using statistical downscaling model (SDSM) to project the future changes in rainfall and temperature at local scale. The irrigation water demand estimation model known as CROPWAT is calibrated and validated with historical data and then used to project the future changes in irrigation demand under SDSM projected climatic condition. The results show that temperature and rainfall in the area will increase by 0.2° C and 4% per decade, respectively over the time period 2020-2099. The changes in climate will reduce irrigation water demand at a rate of 0.9% per decade in the area. However, the irrigation demand will be much more variable in future, and therefore, the major challenge in water resources management will be to handle the uncertainty. It is expected that the seasonal and annual variations in irrigation demand projected by the study will help in operating reservoirs and sustainable management of water resources in the region in the context of climate change. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:54","2018-01-19 23:13:54","","","","7","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change scenarios; Rain; Water management; Water resources; Water resources management; downscaling; modeling; sustainability; climate change; irrigation; water management; water resource; Water; Down-scaling; Water supply; Irrigation; water use; water demand; Reservoirs (water); Sustainable management; Malaysia; CROPWAT; Global circulation model; Paddy cultivated areas; Statistical downscaling model (SDSM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resilience of an urban drainage system is the system's ability to recover from flooding or inundation damage. A novel pump operating method is proposed in this paper as a nonstructural measure, while expansion of the discharge pump capacity is considered to be a structural measure. The proposed method is demonstrated by application to the Daerim sewer network in Seoul, Korea, which has a discharge pump located in the detention reservoir at the center of the study network. The results show that less flooding is predicted with the new operating method than with the current operating method. Additionally, the new operating method, in conjunction with a pump capacity reflecting the inflow into the detention reservoir, yields stable results in most operating scenarios.

Fuzzy membership functions for minimizing the pipe network cost and maximizing a number of reliability surrogates are defined, and the model maximizes the degree of satisfaction of these membership functions. Reliability surrogates investigated include: (1) the sum over all nodes of the relative surplus of energy at each node; (2) the minimum surplus head at a critical node; (3) the sum over all nodes of the relative surplus of energy at each node modified by the degree of uniformity of its associated loop; and (4) the minimum uniformity of the associated loops over all nodes.

This paper presents a new optimal rehabilitation methodology for WDSs based on the graph theory clustering concept. The methodology starts with partitioning the WDS based on its connectivity properties into a number of clusters (small subsystems). Pipes that might have direct impact on system performance are identified and considered for the rehabilitation problem. Three optimization-based strategies are then considered for pipe rehabilitation in the clustered network: (1) rehabilitation of some of the pipes inside the clusters, (2) rehabilitation of pipes in the path supplying water to the clusters, and (3) a combination of Strategies 1 and 2. In all optimization strategies, the decision variables for the rehabilitation problem are the diameters of duplicated pipes; the objective functions are to minimize the total cost of duplicated pipes and the number of nodes with pressure deficiency. The performance of proposed strategies was demonstrated in a large WDS with pressure deficiencies. The performance of these strategies was also compared to the full search space optimization strategy and engineering judgment-based optimization strategy in which all pipes and selection of pipes are considered as decision variables, respectively. The results show that Strategy 3 is able to generate solutions with similar performance that are cheaper by around 53% and 35% in comparison with the full search space and engineering judgment-based optimization strategies, respectively. The results also demonstrate that the cluster-based approach can reduce the computational efforts for achieving optimum solutions compared to the other optimization strategies. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:14","2018-01-19 23:14:14","","","","7","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; cluster analysis; optimization; performance assessment; water supply; water management; water resource; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Computation theory; Computational effort; Graph theory; Engineering judgments; Clustering; Water distribution system (WDSs); Cluster based approach; Connectivity properties; Optimal rehabilitation; Optimization strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chlorination is a common practice for secondary disinfection, essential for protection against microbiological regrowth and contaminant intrusion. However, higher levels of free residual chlorine (FRC) may lead to unwanted disinfectant by-products (DBPs) and taste and odor complaints. Booster chlorination can be used to maintain minimum levels of FRC. This requires proper selection of booster locations. The approach proposed here uses a generic hydraulic and water quality modeling software programmers' toolkit to predict FRC and total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) converted, thereafter, into a water quality index (WQI). A heuristic algorithm maximum covering location problem (MCLP) used in optimization maximizes WQI. TTHM is converted into trihalomethane (THM) species using quadratic optimization, then to cancer and noncancer risk potentials. Finally, the required number of booster stations is recommended based on a trade-offanalysis of risk potentials, WQI, and the life cycle cost of booster chlorination. For proof of concept, case studies are conducted in a hypothetical and a municipal DN. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:21","2018-01-19 23:14:21","","","","7","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; algorithm; optimization; Computer software; water quality; Optimization; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; chlorination; Chlorine; Location; Heuristic algorithms; heuristics; Water distribution networks; Electric power distribution; Quadratic programming; Booster chlorination; Chlorination; chlorine; disinfection; Disinfection; Disinfection by-product; Life cycle; life cycle analysis; Life cycle costs (LCC); Residual chlorines; Water quality indexes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), in combination with data preprocessing techniques, have been used for water demand prediction due to their ability to handle large amounts of complex nonlinear data. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is one of the most widely employed data preprocessing techniques, and is used in combination with ANNs to improve prediction accuracy and extend prediction lead time. However, DWT is known to have serious drawbacks, and the accuracy and prediction lead times of the models have not been satisfactory. In this study, multiplicative season algorithm (MSA) is applied for the first time as an alternative data preprocessing technique in the area of hydrology and its performance is compared with DWT. The outputs of MSA and DWT are used as inputs to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in order to develop combined models called discrete wavelet transform-multilayer perceptron (DWT-MLP) and multiplicative season algorithm-multilayer perceptron (MSA-MLP), which are compared with the stand-alone MLP model. The results demonstrate that MSA is a better preprocessing technique than DWT and, thus, that MSA captures periodicity and converts nonstationary time series into stationary time series better than DWT. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:27","2018-01-19 23:14:27","","","","6","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; Water management; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; algorithm; wavelet analysis; Water consumption; water management; Forecasting; water resource; Neural networks; numerical model; Multi layer perceptron; Multilayers; water use; Deep neural networks; sustainable development; water demand; Discrete wavelet transforms; transform; Data preprocessing technique; Non-stationary time series; Prediction accuracy; Preprocessing techniques; Stationary time series; Water consumption predictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most topologically significant nodes make other nodes unstable when added or removed, and they occur throughout the network. The most redundant node pairs have few but identical connections.

In SWH system design, practitioners must account for trade-offs between cost, supply volume, and water quality improvement performance, which depend on design decisions for the type, size, and spatial distribution of BMPs. As such, the design of SWH systems with distributed BMPs is a complex, multiobjective optimization problem with a large decision space. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization framework to assess trade-offs in spatially distributed SWH system designs. The framework was applied to a case study for a housing development in Adelaide, South Australia. The results illustrated the potential benefits of distributing BMPs in an integrated SWH system where space at the catchment outlet is limited.

The two categories differ in the spatial scale considered for demand generation. In detail, the models of the first category generate the demand as a whole at the household spatial scale. Those of the second category instead generate the demand at the scale of the microcomponents-that is, the various fixtures producing water demand pulses-and sum the microcontributions to obtain the total instantaneous demand of the household. The models of the first category are parameterized based on demand measurements. The models of the second category (actually, only one model exists, named SIMDEUM, standing for SIMulation of water Demand, an End-Use Model) are instead parameterized as a function of information derived from surveys, such as household occupants' age and behavior, number and kind of household fixtures. This paper presents a review of the models for water demand pulse generation. In this review, the main differences in the modeling structure are described and the various parameterization methods are presented. Though the two categories of model operate at different spatial scales, three models-that is, two models of the first category, Poisson rectangular pulse (PRP) and PRP with correlated pulse durations and intensities (cor-PRP), and model SIMDEUM for the second category-are chosen as representative and are applied to a case study in Milford, Ohio, for which demand measurements and information about the household fixtures and occupants are all available.

This contribution proposes a novel two-step strategy for DMA planning. The first step is optimal segmentation design by maximizing the WDN-oriented modularity index versus minimizing the number of conceptual cuts (i.e., not accounting for devices). The second step is the actual optimal DMA design, returning the positions of flow meters and closed valves at the conceptual cuts. Since closed valves change the system's hydraulic paths, the implementation of DMAs could allow reductions in pressure and leakages through the WDN. Optimal DMA design is therefore achieved by solving a three-objective optimization minimizing the number of flow meters and total unsupplied customer demand while maximizing the reduction of background leakages; thus, pressure-driven modeling is mandatory. The effectiveness and flexibility of the procedure is demonstrated using the Apulian and Exnet networks. Results shows that DMA implementation can allow leakage reduction in systems with excess hydraulic capacity. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:15:47","2018-01-19 23:15:47","","","","6","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Zoning; modeling; optimization; water supply; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; leakage; Flow measurement; Water distribution networks; Leakage reduction; Flowmeters; Customer demands; Hydraulic capacity; Minimizing the number of; Objective optimization; Optimal segmentation; Pressure-driven models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing reliable procedures to estimate real losses in such circumstances is essential to assess the leakage phenomenon and eventually drive the upgrade of existing monitoring systems. This work proposes a simple bottom-up methodology to estimate leakage using WDN inflow data series while only exploiting the seasonal fluctuation of water consumptions. It resorts to a data-assimilation strategy whose formulation is consistent with the physical behavior of WDNs and requires the estimate of only a few numerical parameters.

These systems are susceptible to widespread contamination. It is necessary to provide a minimum level of performance for DWDNs by decreasing their vulnerability to contamination. In this paper, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of DWDN response to biological and chemical contaminants. A simulation model is developed for analysis of a DWDN in the eastern part of Tehran, Iran. Various scenarios are defined based on type of contaminants, reactions with chlorine, contaminants' dose and injection duration, and chlorine initial concentration to see how the network would respond to the spread of contamination. Based on the network's ability to provide demand with acceptable quality, an index is suggested for vulnerability assessment. To mitigate the network's vulnerability, chlorine injection and pipe closures are suggested. Results show that the proposed index can be used for identifying the DWDN critical nodes and for comparison of network performance in different scenarios.

This paper omits this assumption and introduces the concept of topological observability analysis (TOA), which aims to determine not only if it would be possible to compute the hydraulic state of a network from the available measurement set (ordinary OA), but also if the status of pumps and valves would be observable as well. Additionally, a method is proposed that modifies the standard measurement Jacobian matrix by incorporating either equations and/or unknowns depending on the available information for each specific pump or valve.

Most existing research focuses on either water consumption planning (e.g., supply-demand balance) or water postconsumption planning (e.g., wastewater planning). It is expected to be more cost-effective to integrate the water consumption and postconsumption planning into a holistic model since they are highly interdependent. In this research, a closed-loop integrated water system including sources, water plants, end users, and wastewater systems is modeled using the network theory, and a robust planning decision model is developed to minimize the total system costs including operation costs (e.g., water production and distribution costs, and wastewater treatment costs) and penalty costs associated with directly emitting untreated wastewater to the environment. Various levels of uncertainties from both water demand and pipeline efficiencies are considered. Three sets of experiments are developed to test the effectiveness of the proposed decision model. The experimental results conclude that (1) the integrated decision approach can achieve more cost savings compared to separated decision processes for both the deterministic and stochastic scenarios; (2) the authors' proposed robust model can provide good balance between system robustness and cost; and (3) the integrated water system is more cost-effective when the water processing cost is dynamic, which highlights the benefits of the inventory and on-site third-party water plants. Analogous to the smart power-grid innovation, which employs on-site generation and storage systems to improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, the authors' proposed model demonstrates the benefits of using on-site inventory and third-party water plants to renovate the existing water infrastructure for more cost savings and reduced environmental impacts. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:17:53","2018-01-19 23:17:53","","","","5","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; optimization; water supply; water management; Optimization; Integer programming; Mixed integer programming; water resource; decision making; Environmental impact; Decision theory; Water supply; infrastructure; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Cost effectiveness; Sustainable development; Costs; Water infrastructure; Wastewater treatment; Robust optimization; Waterworks; Electric power transmission networks; Decision under uncertainty; Energy efficiency; planning process; Water system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pipe roughness (the Hazen-Williams C-factor) is computed by using the ratio of simulated to adjusted head losses, while the outliers are detected and removed by using boundary-fence and gross-error-detection techniques. The iterative loops of model simulation and head loss adjustment under multiple operating conditions support that pipe roughness can be realistically estimated even when nodal demands and head measurements are noisy.

However, the PDA methods reported so far attempt to achieve this by either developing a new PDA methodology, which requires modifying the source code of hydraulic solvers, or using iterative-type approaches in which artificial elements (like suitably chosen reservoirs) are added to network nodes until convergence is achieved. None of this is ideal, because the former is difficult to implement and the latter results in computationally inefficient PDA solvers that are difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to use in larger networks, especially under extended period simulation conditions. The PDA modeling approach proposed here does not require either of the aforementioned, because it is based on a single iteration-type algorithm, which involves connecting a set of artificial elements to each network node with demand and deficient pressure. This set consists of a check valve, a flow control valve, and a flow emitter. The new PDA method developed was validated on a number of benchmark and real-life networks under different flow conditions, clearly demonstrating its advantages when compared to existing methods.

This paper presents a method for assessing impacts and adaptation strategies to global change in a river basin system at different temporal horizons using a hydro-economic model. First, a multiobjective analysis selects climate change projections based on the fitting of the climate models to the historical conditions for the historical period. Inflows for climate change scenarios are generated using calibrated rainfall-runoff models, perturbing observed meteorological time series according to the projected anomalies in mean and standard deviation. Demands are projected for the different scenarios and characterized using economic demand curves. With the new water resource and demand scenarios, the impact of global change on system performance is assessed using a hydro-economic model with reliability and economic indices. A new economic loss index is defined to assess the economic equity of the system. Selected adaptation strategies are simulated to compare performance with the business-as-usual scenario. The approach is applied to the Jucar River water resource system, in eastern Spain, using climate projections from the European Union (EU) ENSEMBLES project. Results show that the system is vulnerable to global change, especially over the long term, and that adaptation actions can save €3-65-million/year. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:19:14","2018-01-19 23:19:14","","","","5","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Water management; Water resources; rainfall-runoff modeling; Spain; climate change; water management; Climate models; water resource; Economics; river basin; Rainfall-runoff models; adaptive management; Water resource systems; Mean and standard deviations; Climate change projections; Losses; Jucar Basin; Impacts and adaptation; Multi-objective analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efficient algorithms for identifying optimal WDS designs also must be practical for realistic systems. Differential evolution (DE) algorithms, which harness the mutation operator to identify populations containing very different alternatives, have been shown to be more efficient than other heuristics for solving single objective versions of these problems, e.g., minimizing the cost of WDSs. By examining the entire population and evaluating those members that dominate in terms of two or more objectives, nondominated sorting algorithms efficiently identify the Pareto optimal front in multiobjective problems, and one such algorithm, the improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), has been applied successfully to evaluate the cost-reliability tradeoff for WDSs. The nondominated sorting differential evolution (NSDE) algorithm, which takes advantage of the mutation operations in DE and nondominated sorting, and its variation NSDE with ranking-based mutation (NSDE-RMO), have been demonstrated as efficient for solving multiobjective problems. In this paper, NSDE and NSDE-RMO were applied to discrete WDS optimization for the first time, and their high performance was demonstrated compared with NSGA-II and the multialgorithm, genetically adaptive multiobjective (AMALGAM) method, a widely applied hybrid metaheuristic multiobjective algorithm. For three benchmark networks, NSDE and its variation performed similarly to or better than NSGA-II and AMALGAM except at high cost levels. For hypothetical randomly generated networks ranging from 100 to 400 nodes, and 100 to 800 pipes, the Pareto optimal front of the NSDE algorithms dominated all other algorithms, exhibiting more, and more varied, Pareto optimal solutions, and they converged sooner. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:19:30","2018-01-19 23:19:30","","","","4","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","design; optimization; genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto optimal solutions; Optimization; water resource; Problem solving; distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Costs; Evolutionary algorithms; Non-linear relationships; Optimal systems; Water distribution system (WDSs); Multi objective algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II); Non-convex objective functions; Non-dominated sorting algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To understand how the reliabilities, sensitivities, and vulnerabilities of reservoir operations vary across hydrogeologic settings, a bottom-up approach was applied to investigate the reliability of two water resources systems in the future. To represent the uncertainty associated with future streamflow, global climate model projections were integrated with a formal Bayesian uncertainty analysis and groundwater-surface water hydrologic modeling. Finally, the effectiveness of variable rule curves for mitigating the effects of climate change was evaluated. Increasing air temperature appeared to reduce the reliability of meeting summer environmental flow targets in the future by 42 and 12% for the groundwater basin and surface water basin, respectively, but had negligible impacts on reservoir refilling and flood regulation. Variable rule curves mitigated the impact of climate change on summer flow target reliability without compromising flood risk reduction.

Mitigation strategies specify response actions, such as warning consumers to reduce water activities using the news media and flushing contaminated water at hydrants. The performance of alternative response actions may be influenced by sociotechnical dynamics, as consumer reactions to contaminant exposure and information about the event can change water demands, hydraulics, propagation of a contaminant plume, and public health consequences. This research develops a modeling framework to test and evaluate mitigation decisions that a utility manager may take to protect public health over a wide range of contamination events. An agent-based modeling framework is developed to integrate social behaviors with technical artifacts in a sociotechnical model to evaluate the public health consequences of a water event. Social actors, including consumers and utility managers, are represented as agents and are coupled with a water distribution network model and a news media model to evaluate the performance of response strategies. Strategies for flushing hydrants are encoded as decision trees that specify the location and timing of hydrant flushing, based on the activation of water-quality sensors. The agent-based model is described using the Overview, Design, and Details protocol and is demonstrated for a virtual midsized municipality, Mesopolis. Results compare the effectiveness of flushing hydrants using cautious and adaptive response strategies and the use of the news media to disseminate warning messages.

Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available. By integrating these alternatives, economic analyses for reservoirs will be more accurate, reservoir life spans will be more sustainable, profits will be extended indefinitely, and the economic burdens placed on future generations will be lessened. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:22:23","2018-01-19 23:22:23","","","","3","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; reservoir; sustainability; Sediments; Environmental impact; Water supply systems; Water supply; Insurance; economic analysis; Sustainable development; Reservoirs (water); Costs; sedimentation; Reservoir management; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; Economic analysis; infrastructural development; Reservoir capacity; Construction costs; Dam decommissioning; dam repair; Damage information; decommissioning; Future generations; Gavins Point Dam; Insurance policies; Intergenerational equity; Reconstruction (structural); Sediment management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An ensemble method structure (EMS) was designed to screen out the most suitable method structure for segmenting flood season. The performance of the proposed EMS approach was evaluated in a case study in Chengbihe Reservoir, China. The results indicate that the method structures containing flood volume series sampled by using the peaks-over-threshold (POT) technique outperform the other method structures. To further explore the impacts of the flood volume index and the POT sampling technique on segmentations, the 1-, 3-, and 5-day flood volume series sampled by using the POT1, POT2, and POT3 techniques, respectively, were used to segment the flood season by using the method of directional statistics. The main findings are as follows: (1) the segmentation is most sensitive to the selected indices, sensitive to the sampling techniques, and least sensitive to the segmentation methods; and (2) the variance of the segmentations increases with the amount of flood data used in segmenting flood season. Thus, the segmentations of the flood season in the Chengbihe Reservoir can be obtained by averaging the dates obtained with the latter constructed method structures. The case study demonstrates that the proposed EMS approach can be an effective tool for flood season segmentation. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:22:39","2018-01-19 23:22:39","","","","3","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; statistical analysis; seasonality; probability; Floods; sampling; Sampling; Water levels; water level; Reservoirs (water); ensemble forecasting; Change-point analysis; Ensemble methods; Directional statistics; Flood season; reservoir flooding; Sampling technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to an imbalance between supply and demand and, thus, an increase in the vulnerability of water supply systems. Accordingly, methods for systematic analysis and multifactor assessment are needed to estimate the vulnerability of individual components in an integrated water supply system. This paper introduces a new approach to comprehensively assess vulnerability by integrating water resource system characteristics with factors representing exposure, sensitivity, severity, potential severity, social vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. These factors provide a way to consider broader system elements beyond the traditional vulnerability evaluation methods solely on the basis of the magnitude of failure (i.e., severity). In this way, the new vulnerability index gives a more detailed assessment with the potential to recognize critical conditions and components in an integrated system. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach are checked using an investigation of the water supply system of Salt Lake City (SLC), Utah. First, an integrated water resource model was developed using a system simulation software to allocate water from different sources in SLC among designated demand points. The model contains individual simulation modules with representative interconnections among the natural hydroclimate system, built water infrastructure, and institutional decision making. The results of the analysis illustrate that basing vulnerability on a sole factor may lead to insufficient understanding and, hence, inefficient management of the system. For example, ranking of different water sources on the basis of the traditional vulnerability index (i.e., severity) in SLC is not consistent with the ranking on the basis of the proposed integrated vulnerability index. Therefore, during a failure event in the system, such as a water shortage, incomplete understanding of the system's performance may lead to incorrect decisions by managers. The new vulnerability index and assessment approach was able to identify the most vulnerable water sources in the SLC integrated water supply system. In conclusion, use of a more comprehensive approach to simulate the system behavior and estimate vulnerability provides more guidance for decision makers to detect vulnerable components of the system and ameliorate decision making. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:22:51","2018-01-19 23:22:51","","","","3","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; United States; Utah; Vulnerability; Water management; Water resources; modeling; water supply; Computer software; water management; vulnerability; water resource; Economics; Water supply systems; Water supply; assessment method; metropolitan area; Adaptive capacity; Integrated water resource management; Water system; Air navigation; Goldsim; Salt Lake City","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The performance of these new indices is evaluated and compared with that of four existing indices (three other energy-related indices-i.e., resilience index, network resilience index, and modified resilience index-and the entropy-based method, i.e., diameter-sensitive flow entropy) according to the following two-step methodology. In the first step, the application of the multiobjective optimization makes it possible to determine optimal network configurations that trade-offthe installation cost (to be minimized) against the generic indirect reliability index (to be maximized). In the second step, the performance of the optimal solutions in terms of explicit reliability assessment is examined under conditions in which the original network is perturbed by applying demand variations and random pipe failures to account for future operating uncertainties.

In this paper new, explicit formulas for the first-order sensitivities of water distribution system (WDS) steady-state heads and flows to changes in demands, resistance factors, roughnesses, relative roughnesses, and diameters are presented. The formulas cover both pressure-dependent modeling (PDM) and demand-dependent modeling (DDM) problems in which either the Hazen-Williams or the Darcy-Weisbach head-loss models are used. Two important applications of sensitivity matrices, namely calibration and sensor placement, are discussed and illustrative examples of the use of sensitivity matrices in those applications are given. The use of sensitivity matrices in first-order confidence estimation is briefly discussed. The superior stability of the PDM formulation over DDM is established by the examination of the sensitivity matrices for the same network solved by both model paradigms. The sensitivity matrices and the key matrices in both the global gradient method for DDM problems and its counterpart for PDM problems have many elements in common.

The prediction curve was used to investigate the relative ranking of the pipes from the three models. The curve was demonstrated to be more suitable for practical situations compared to the traditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The expected number of failures and the effect of incorporating covariates by dividing the pipe assets into smaller pressure cohorts were also examined. Based on the data sets used, the observations from the prediction curves show that the performance of the three models are very similar in terms of pipe ranking. However, the BSM is more advantageous because of its relative simplicity. The covariate, the number of known past failures, plays a very important role when considering the relative ranking of the pipes in the network. The NHPP and HBP are recommended if the total number of failures in the network is required. Subdividing one of the data sets (Data Set A) into a smaller pressure cohort showed improvement only for the prediction by the BSM. Unlike the NHPP, time is not specifically included in the HBP and BSM.

The extra runoff from human-made impervious surfaces overloads water bodies with polluted runoff. Since many LID best management practices (BMPs) exist, and many areas have multiple subcatchments, it is important to carefully select which BMPs to place in each subcatchment and its placement in order to minimize cost, but also to give the highest chance of owner BMP maintenance. LID BMPs are often constructed on private land and maintenance can be at the owner's expense and, therefore, not guaranteed. A new algorithm, entitled multi-objective, socio-economic, boundary-emanating, nearest distance (MOSEBEND), that is easily used by practitioners is introduced and demonstrated here for a road in a community showing that the algorithm allows the selection of the set of BMPs on the various subcatchments with the lowest cost, highest runoff restoration to natural values, and highest likelihood of private-owner maintenance. The BMP selection and location starts at the downstream watershed boundary and propagates upstream, and then works in the upstream-to-downstream direction from the upstream watershed boundary. The multiple objectives addressed are cost-benefit ratio (CBR) and maintenance probability factor (MPF). The optimal solution is considered to be the one closest to the origin on a plot of CBR and MPF. It was found that the new algorithm resulted in a solution that is (1) low cost, (2) high benefit, and (3) more likely to be built and maintained than an analysis of any subset of these three objectives. The option with the highest cost-benefit-ratio is that in which LID BMPs are implemented in the upper and steeper portion of the catchment, for the watershed that the algorithm is demonstrated herein. However, that option has a less likely chance to be maintained and, therefore, is not ranked first by the MOSEBEND algorithm proposed here. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:12","2018-01-19 23:24:12","","","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; algorithm; Rivers; runoff; Watersheds; Catchments; Storms; Surface waters; Impervious surface; Low impact development; Costs; best management practice; stormwater; Multiple-objectives; Watershed boundaries; Best management practice (BMPs); Cost benefit analysis; Storm water runoff; Distance algorithm; Maintenance; Runoff restorations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The benefits and risks can be in opposition to each other, such as having enough water for hydropower generation while leaving enough room for flood protection. In addition to multiple objects, the uncertainty of streamflow can make decision making difficult. This paper develops a stochastic optimization model for reservoir refill operation with the objective of maximizing the expected synthesized energy production for a cascade system of hydropower stations while considering flood risk. Streamflow uncertainty is addressed by discretized streamflow scenarios and flood risk is controlled by a joint chance constraint restricting the occurrence probability. With the variability of flood risk level, two advancing refill scenarios for exploring operation benefit are presented. Scenario I loosens the current stagewise storage bounds conditions and allows advancing reservoir refills but keeps the flood risk level the same as the refill policies obtained under the current storage bounds. Scenario II keeps the current storage bounds unchanged but allows increases in flood risk level. The proposed methodology is applied to the Xiluodu cascade system of reservoirs in China and investigates the optimal refill policies obtained by both scenarios. Compared with the benchmark obtained under the current storage bounds and lowest flood risk level, the results show (1) the synthesized energy production can be improved by 2.13% without changing the flood risk level under Scenario I, and (2) the synthesized energy production can also be increased by 0.21% at the expense of increasing the flood risk level by 4.4% when Scenario II is employed. As Scenario I produces higher benefit and lower risk than Scenario II, it is recommended to loosen the current stagewise storage bounds but to keep the flood risk level unchanged during refill operations. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:59","2018-01-19 23:24:59","","","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; algorithm; optimization; reservoir; streamflow; Stochastic programming; Optimization; Risk perception; Floods; Flood control; risk assessment; flood control; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; water storage; stochasticity; Flood risks; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Risks; Hydro-power generation; Hydroelectric power; Streamflow uncertainty; operations technology; Stochastic optimization model; Chance constraint; Hydropower stations; Occurrence probability; Progressive optimality algorithm; Xiluodu Reservoir","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate and predict the Lago Loíza water budget, an artificial neural network (ANN) technique is trained to predict river inflows. A method is developed to combine ANN-predicted daily flows with ANN-predicted 30-day cumulative flows to improve flow estimates. The ANN application trains well for representing 2007-2012 and the drier 1994-1997 periods. Rainfall data downscaled from global circulation model (GCM) simulations are used to predict 2050-2055 conditions.

These simulated 2050-2055 river flows are input to a water budget formulation for the Lago Loíza reservoir for comparison with 2007-2012.

The framework relies on the codevelopment of a DSS tool that is able to explicitly reproduce the decision-making processes and criteria considered by the system operators. Fuzzy logic is used to derive the implicit operating rules followed by the managers, and is based on historical decisions and expert knowledge obtained in the codevelopment process, combining both sources of information. Fuzzy regression is used to forecast future inflows based on the meteorological and hydrological variables considered by the system operators in their decisions on reservoir operation. The DSS was validated against historical records. The developed framework and tools offer the system operators a way to predefine a set of feasible ex ante management decisions, and to explore the consequences associated with any single choice. In contrast with other approaches, the fuzzy-based method used in this study is able to embed inflow uncertainty and its effects in the definition of the decisions on the system operation. Furthermore, the method is flexible enough to be applied to other water resource systems. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:25:31","2018-01-19 23:25:31","","","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Water resources; reservoir; Spain; decision support system; Decision support systems; Artificial intelligence; decision making; Decision support system (dss); fuzzy mathematics; river system; Reservoirs (water); Management decisions; historical record; Decision making process; Water resource systems; Fuzzy logic; Hydrological variables; Sources of informations; Multi-reservoir systems; Collaborative framework; Jucar River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The variations in branch and loop combinatorics across large pipe network data sets are ideal for exploring graph-based structural patterns and linkages with engineered performance. To facilitate this exploration, a library of 10,001 lattice-like pipe networks is developed. Each network is equipped with hydraulic, water quality, and diurnal demand information for extended period simulations. Results show strong correlations exist among graph theory metrics (e.g., geodesic, spectral, and combinatorics-based) and performance measures (e.g., maximum hourly unit headloss, average water age, and average chemical concentration). These trends are extended with performance predictions using parametric and semiparametric statistical models. Predictive accuracies are evident for processes that follow diffusion-like behaviors, indicating coupled applications of graph theory and statistical methods may have strong abilities to characterize WDSs at lower computational and analytical costs. Evidence also reveals features from percolation theory, with sharp phase transitions in WDS performance at certain probabilistic thresholds of pipe network connectivity. This may support future probabilistic studies on WDS performance with percolation-like transitions. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:25:46","2018-01-19 23:25:46","","","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; performance assessment; Statistical modeling; Generalized additive model; data set; water quality; Statistical methods; probability; concentration (composition); distribution system; Water distribution systems; Water supply systems; Computation theory; future prospect; diurnal variation; theoretical study; demand analysis; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Topology; percolation; Solvents; Percolation (solid state); EPANET; Combinatorial mathematics; Network topology; Percolation theory; Pipe networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, resilience means the capacity to reach an acceptable level of functionality during and after a flood. Observations of the recent history of flood disasters in New Orleans and New York City (NYC) have suggested the necessity of quantifying resilience in these regions utilizing a floodplain's vulnerability assessment platform. Once a meaningful and well-recognized method is developed, then resources can be allocated to increase resiliency. In this study, redundancy, resourcefulness, robustness, and rapidity metrics based on socioeconomic, manmade, and natural conditions are developed to quantify coastal resilience. Exposure and susceptibility are also defined and evaluated for quantifying vulnerability. The proposed evaluation method, which is based on the linear combination of the developed metrics, uses a multicriteria decision making technique for ranking the factors of the system and their weights. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to determine the sensitivity of the developed platform to 54 different factors affecting the system's vulnerability and the uncertainty associated with estimating the representative values and weights of those factors. The proposed platform allows identifying those factors that have the most significant impact on resiliency. As a result, resource allocation could be directed to strengthen those factors rather than ad hoc allocations without consideration of their overall impact on building a more resilient region. Application of the proposed scheme is investigated using a coastal area in the Bronx Borough of NYC. The proposed algorithm can be applied to other coastal areas in identifying effective factors on their system's flood resiliency. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:02","2018-01-19 23:26:02","","","","1","143","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; United States; algorithm; Uncertainty analysis; Floods; flooding; vulnerability; Economics; resource allocation; assessment method; floodplain; uncertainty analysis; urban area; disaster management; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; coastal zone; Coastal zones; quantitative analysis; Exposure; New York [United States]; Louisiana; New York [New York (STT)]; Vulnerability assessments; coastal protection; Coastal urban area; Flood vulnerabilities; Multi-criteria decision making technique; New Orleans; Representative values; Resiliency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

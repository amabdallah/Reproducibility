This paper proposes a cloud model based multi-attribute decision making framework (CM-MADM) with Monte Carlo for the contaminated-groundwater remediation strategies selection. The cloud model is used to handle imprecise numerical quantities, which can describe the fuzziness and stochasticity of the information fully and precisely. In the proposed approach, the contaminated concentrations are aggregated via the backward cloud generator and the weights of attributes are calculated by employing the weight cloud module. A case study on the remedial alternative selection for a contaminated site suffering from a 1,1,1-trichloroethylene leakage problem in Shanghai, China is conducted to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the developed approach. Totally, an attribute system which consists of ten attributes were used for evaluating each alternative through the developed method under uncertainty, including daily total pumping rate, total cost and cloud model based health risk. Results indicated that A14 was evaluated to be the most preferred alternative for the 5-year, A5 for the 10-year, A4 for the 15-year and A6 for the 20-year remediation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:09","2018-01-19 23:05:09","","881-893","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; Risk assessment; Water management; groundwater; Fuzzy set theory; water management; Health risks; Monte Carlo analysis; Pollution; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; risk assessment; Fuzzy systems; numerical model; decision making; uncertainty analysis; fuzzy mathematics; Cloud computing; stochasticity; Shanghai; health risk; Site selection; multivariate analysis; 1-dichloroethane; Alternative selections; Cloud modeling; Contaminated groundwater; ethane; Ground water remediation; Multi attribute decision making; Multi-attribute analysis; Remediation; Selection and evaluations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the transport and fate of bacteriophages MS2, PRD1, and ΦX174 were studied in sediment and stormwater (SW) collected from a MAR site in Parafield, Australia. Column experiments were conducted using SW, stormwater in equilibrium with the aquifer sediment (EQ-SW), and two pore-water velocities (1 and 5 m day−1) to encompass expected behavior at the MAR site. The aquifer sediment removed &gt;92.3% of these viruses under all of the considered MAR conditions. However, much greater virus removal (4.6 logs) occurred at the lower pore-water velocity and in EQ-SW that had a higher ionic strength and Ca2+ concentration. Virus removal was greatest for MS2, followed by PRD1, and then ΦX174 for a given physicochemical condition. The vast majority of the attached viruses were irreversibly attached or inactivated on the solid phase, and injection of Milli-Q water or beef extract at pH = 10 only mobilized a small fraction of attached viruses (&lt;0.64%). Virus breakthrough curves (BTCs) were successfully simulated using an advective–dispersive model that accounted for rates of attachment (katt), detachment (kdet), irreversible attachment or solid phase inactivation (μs), and blocking. Existing MAR guidelines only consider the removal of viruses via liquid phase inactivation (μl). However, our results indicated that katt &gt; μs &gt; kdet &gt; μl, and katt was several orders of magnitude greater than μl. Therefore, current microbial risk assessment methods in the MAR guideline may be overly conservative in some instances. Interestingly, virus BTCs exhibited blocking behavior and the calculated solid surface area that contributed to the attachment was very small. Additional research is therefore warranted to study the potential influence of blocking on virus transport and potential implications for MAR guidelines. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:10","2018-01-19 23:05:10","","724-735","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Risk assessment; Sediments; aquifer; Aquifers; risk assessment; Water; environmental fate; Water conservation; Storms; pollutant removal; guideline; recharge; stormwater; South Australia; calcium; Wastewater reclamation; Calcium; Recharging (underground waters); Managed aquifer recharges; Orders of magnitude; Stormwaters; mobilization; sediment; advection-diffusion equation; transport process; breakthrough curve; Water injection; bacteriophage; Bacteriophages; Ionic strength; Microbial risk assessment; Parafield; Physicochemical conditions; porewater; Reclamation and reuse; Solid-phase; Transport; Viruses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantification of these extreme events has always been a great challenge, which is further compounded by climate variability and change. Recently complex network theory was applied in earth science community to investigate spatial connections among hydrologic fluxes (e.g., rainfall and streamflow) in water cycle. However, there are limited applications of complex network theory for investigating hydroclimatic extreme events. This article attempts to provide an overview of complex networks and extreme events, event synchronization method, construction of networks, their statistical significance and the associated network evaluation metrics. For illustration purpose, we apply the complex network approach to study the spatio-temporal evolution of droughts in Continental USA (CONUS). A different drought threshold leads to a new drought event as well as different socio-economic implications. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the role of thresholds on spatio-temporal evolution of drought through network analysis. In this study, long term (1900–2016) Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) was selected for spatio-temporal drought analysis using three network-based metrics (i.e., strength, direction and distance). The results indicate that the drought events propagate differently at different thresholds associated with initiation of drought events. The direction metrics indicated that onset of mild drought events usually propagate in a more spatially clustered and uniform approach compared to onsets of moderate droughts. The distance metric shows that the drought events propagate for longer distance in western part compared to eastern part of CONUS. We believe that the network-aided metrics utilized in this study can be an important tool in advancing our knowledge on drought propagation as well as other hydroclimatic extreme events. Although the propagation of droughts is investigated using the network approach, however process (physics) based approaches is essential to further understand the dynamics of hydroclimatic extreme events. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:10","2018-01-19 23:05:10","","600-620","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; Water resources; drought; hydrological cycle; streamflow; climate change; Drought; spatiotemporal analysis; network analysis; extreme event; complexity; Complex networks; quantitative analysis; Extreme events; Water resources planning; threshold; Palmer drought severity indices; Circuit theory; Climate variability and change; Disaster mitigation; Event synchronization; Spatiotemporal evolution; Statistical significance; synchrony","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Time series data of GWL, river water level and precipitation were collected for 3 years (July 2012 to June 2015) from an alluvial aquifer underneath an agricultural area of the Nakdong river basin, South Korea. Based on the wavelet coefficients of the final approximation, the GWL data was clustered into three groups (WCG1 to WCG3). Two dynamic factors (DFs) were then extracted using DFA for each group; thus, six major factors were extracted. Next, the time–frequency variability of the extracted DFs was examined using multiresolution cross-correlation analysis (MRCCA) with the following steps: 1) major driving forces and their scales in GWL fluctuations were identified by comparing maximum correlation coefficients (rmax) between DFs and the GWL time series and 2) the results were supplemented using the wavelet transformed coherence (WTC) analysis between DFs and the hydrological time series. Finally, relative contributions of six major DFs to the GWL fluctuations could be quantitatively assessed by calculating the effective dynamic efficiency (Def). The characteristics and relevant process of the identified six DFs are: 1) WCG1DF4,1 as an indicative of seasonal agricultural pumping (scales = 64–128 days; rmax = 0.68–0.89; Def ≤ 23.1%); 2) WCG1DF4,4 representing the cycle of regional groundwater recharge (scales = 64–128 days; rmax = 0.98–1.00; Def ≤ 11.1%); 3) WCG2DF4,1 indicating the complex interaction between the episodes of precipitation and direct runoff (scales = 2–8 days; rmax = 0.82–0.91; Def ≤ 35.3%) and seasonal GW-RW interaction (scales = 64–128 days; rmax = 0.76–0.91; Def ≤ 14.2%); 4) WCG2DF4,4 reflecting the complex effects of seasonal pervasive pumping and the local recharge cycle (scales = 64–128 days; rmax = 0.86–0.94; Def ≤ 16.4%); 5) WCG3DF4,2 as the result of temporal pumping (scales = 2–8 days; rmax = 0.98–0.99; Def ≤ 7.7%); and 6) WCG3DF4,4 indicating the local recharge cycle (scales = 64–128 days; rmax = 0.76–0.91; Def ≤ 34.2 %).

Due that present climate models do not give direct estimates of PET when simulating the hydrological response to future climate change, the PET must be estimated first and is subject to the uncertainty on account of many existing formulae and different input data reliabilities. Using four different PET estimation approaches, i.e., the more physically Penman (PN) equation with less reliable input variables, more empirical radiation-based Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation with relatively dependable downscaled data, the most simply temperature-based Hamon (HM) equation with the most reliable downscaled variable, and downscaling PET directly by the statistical downscaling model, this paper investigated the differences of runoff projection caused by the alternative PET methods by a well calibrated abcd monthly hydrological model. Three catchments, i.e., the Luanhe River Basin, the Source Region of the Yellow River and the Ganjiang River Basin, representing a large climatic diversity were chosen as examples to illustrate this issue. The results indicated that although similar monthly patterns of PET over the period 2021–2050 for each catchment were provided by the four methods, the magnitudes of PET were still slightly different, especially for spring and summer months in the Luanhe River Basin and the Source Region of the Yellow River with relatively dry climate feature. The apparent discrepancy in magnitude of change in future runoff and even the diverse change direction for summer months in the Luanhe River Basin and spring months in the Source Region of the Yellow River indicated that the PET method related uncertainty occurred, especially in the Luanhe River Basin and the Source Region of the Yellow River with smaller aridity index. Moreover, the possible reason of discrepancies in uncertainty between three catchments was quantitatively discussed by the contribution analysis based on climatic elasticity method. This study can provide beneficial reference to comprehensively understand the impacts of climate change on hydrological regime and thus improve the regional strategy for future water resource management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:15","2018-01-19 23:05:15","","298-313","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; downscaling; potential evapotranspiration; Uncertainty; Statistical downscaling; statistical analysis; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Climate models; water resource; runoff; Watersheds; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; hydrological response; Waterresource management; Input output programs; Actual evapotranspiration; Potential evapotranspiration; Jiangxi; hydrological regime; Transport properties; aridity; Estimation approaches; Gan Basin; Luanhe Basin; Runoff changes; Yellow River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to parameter (CNOP-P) approach and a sophisticated land surface model (the Common Land Model, CoLM) are employed in four regions in China to explore extent of uncertainty in soil moisture simulations due to model parameter errors. The CNOP-P approach facilitates calculation of the upper bounds of uncertainty due to parameter errors and investigation of the nonlinear effects of parameter combination on uncertainties in simulation and prediction. The range of uncertainty for simulated soil moisture was found to be from 0.04 to 0.58 m3 m−3. Based on the CNOP-P approach, a new approach is applied to explore a relatively sensitive and important parameter combination for soil moisture simulations and predictions. It is found that the relatively sensitive parameter combination is region- and season-dependent. Furthermore, the results show that simulation of soil moisture could be improved if the errors in these important parameter combinations are reduced. In four study regions, the average extent of improvement (61.6%) in simulating soil moisture using the new approach based on the CNOP-P is larger than that (53.4%) using the one-at-a-time (OAT) approach. These results indicate that simulation and prediction of soil moisture is improved by considering the nonlinear effects of important physical parameter combinations.

Climate change is therefore expected to affect the water supply-demand balance in the Northeast United States and challenge existing water management strategies. The hydrological implications of future climate will affect the design capacity and operating characteristics of dams. The vulnerability of water resources systems to floods and droughts will increase, and the trade-offs between reservoir releases to maintain flood control storage, drought resilience, ecological flow, human water demand, and energy production should be reconsidered. We used a Neural Networks based General Reservoir Operation Scheme to estimate the implications of climate change for dams on a regional scale. This dynamic daily reservoir module automatically adapts to changes in climate and re-adjusts the operation of dams based on water storage level, timing, and magnitude of incoming flows. Our findings suggest that the importance of dams in providing water security in the region will increase. We create an indicator of the Effective Degree of Regulation (EDR) by dams on water resources and show that it is expected to increase, particularly during drier months of year, simply as a consequence of projected climate change. The results also indicate that increasing the size and number of dams, in addition to modifying their operations, may become necessary to offset the vulnerabilities of water resources systems to future climate uncertainties. This is the case even without considering the likely increase in future water demand, especially in the most densely populated regions of the Northeast. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:21","2018-01-19 23:05:21","","435-446","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Dams; Snow; United States; Water management; Water resources; drought; reservoir; water availability; water supply; trend analysis; climate change; water management; Drought; Floods; Flood control; vulnerability; water resource; Economic and social effects; Water supply; flood control; global climate; water storage; Reservoirs (water); demand analysis; snow cover; surface temperature; Water availability; mitigation; flow regulation; Flow regulation; melting; Northeast United States; Regional trends; Water security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, water exchange (represented by water age) was investigated through integrated hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling of the Hongfeng Reservoir, a poorly gauged reservoir in southwest China. The performance of the hydrologic model and parameter replacement among sub-basins with hydrological similarity was verified by historical data. Results showed that hydrological similarity based on the hierarchical cluster analysis and topographic index probability density distribution was reliable with satisfactory performance of parameter replacement. The hydrodynamic model was verified using daily water levels and water temperatures from 2009 and 2010. The water exchange processes in the Hongfeng Reservoir are very complex with temporal, vertical, and spatial variations. The temporal water age was primarily controlled by the variable inflow and outflow, and the maximum and minimum ages for the site near the dam were 406.10 d (15th June) and 90.74 d (3rd August), respectively, in 2010. Distinct vertical differences in water age showed that surface flow, interflow, and underflow appeared alternately, depending on the season and water depth. The worst water exchange situation was found in the central areas of the North Lake with the highest water ages in the bottom on both 15th June and 3rd August, in 2010. Comparison of the spatial water ages revealed that the more favorable hydraulic conditions on 3rd August mainly improved the water exchange in the dam areas and most areas of the South Lake, but had little effect on the bottom layers of the other deepest areas in the South and North Lakes. The presented framework can be applied in other data-scarce waterbodies worldwide to provide better understanding of water exchange processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:23","2018-01-19 23:05:23","","15-30","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; age; reservoir; parameter estimation; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; seasonal variation; hydrodynamics; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrodynamics; three-dimensional modeling; Probability distributions; flow measurement; Water levels; Lakes; Hierarchical systems; coupling; Reservoirs (water); Cluster analysis; Probability density function; water exchange; water depth; 3-d modeling; Guizhou; Hongfeng Reservoir; Parameter replacement; Water ages; Water exchange","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The underlying hypothesis for this work is that a single conceptual model (the MicroOrganism Prediction in Urban Stormwater model – i.e. MOPUS) can adequately simulate microbial dynamics over a variety of water systems and wide range of scales; something which has not been previously tested. Additionally, the application of radar precipitation data for improvement of the model performance at these scales via more accurate areal averaged rainfall intensities was tested. Six comprehensive Escherichia coli (E. coli) datasets collected from five catchments in south-eastern Australia and one catchment in Raleigh, USA, were used to calibrate the model. The MOPUS rainfall-runoff model performed well at all scales (Nash-Sutcliffe E for instantaneous flow rates between 0.70 and 0.93). Sensitivity analysis showed that wet weather urban stormwater flows can be modelled with only three of the five rainfall runoff model parameters: routing coefficient (K), effective imperviousness (IMP) and time of concentration (TOC). The model's performance for representing instantaneous E. coli fluctuations ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 in catchments drained via pipe or open creek, and was the highest for a large riverine catchment (0.64); performing similarly, if not better, than other microbial models in literature. The model could also capture the variability in event mean concentrations (E = 0.17–0.57) and event loads (E = 0.32–0.97) at all scales. Application of weather radar-derived rainfall inputs caused lower overall performance compared to using gauged rainfall inputs in representing both flow and E. coli levels in urban drain catchments, with the performance improving with increasing catchment size and being comparable to the models that use gauged rainfall inputs at the large riverine catchment. These results demonstrate the potential of the MOPUS model and its ability to be applied to a wide range of catchment scales, including large riverine systems. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:25","2018-01-19 23:05:25","","129-140","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Rain; Risk assessment; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; United States; Water quality; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; Models; water quality; Health risks; Risk perception; hydrological modeling; numerical model; assessment method; Catchments; urban area; Precipitation (meteorology); Storms; river water; Pathogens; Rainfall-runoff modeling; environmental impact assessment; estimation method; microbial community; pathogen; Event mean concentrations; Meteorological radar; Radar; North Carolina; Microorganisms; Waterworks; coliform bacterium; drain; E. coli; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli (E. coli); microorganism; MOPUS; Raleigh; Receiving water bodies; South-eastern Australia; Time of concentrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A high-precision apparatus was developed to perform stress-dependent fluid flow tests of fractured rocks. Then, water flow tests on rough-walled fractures with different mechanical displacements were conducted. At each shear level, the hydraulic pressure ranged from 0 to 0.6 MPa, and the normal load varied from 7 to 35 kN. The results show that (i) the relationship between the volumetric flow rate and hydraulic gradient of rough-walled fractures can be well fit using Forchheimer's law. Notably, both the linear and nonlinear coefficients in Forchheimer's law decrease during shearing; (ii) a sixth-order polynomial function is used to evaluate the transmissivity based on the Reynolds number of fractures during shearing. The transmissivity exhibits a decreasing trend as the Reynolds number increases and an increasing trend as the shear displacement increases; (iii) the critical hydraulic gradient, critical Reynolds number and equivalent hydraulic aperture of the rock fractures all increase as the shear displacement increases. When the shear displacement varies from 0 to 15 mm, the critical hydraulic gradient ranges from 0.3 to 2.2 for a normal load of 7 kN and increases to 1.8–8.6 for a normal load of 35 kN; and (iv) the Forchheimer law results are evaluated by plotting the normalized transmissivity of the fractures during shearing against the Reynolds number. An increase in the normal load shifts the fitted curves downward. Additionally, the Forchheimer coefficient β decreases with the shear displacement but increases with the applied normal load. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:27","2018-01-19 23:05:27","","169-184","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Fluid dynamics; three-dimensional modeling; water flow; experimental study; Flow of water; Flow of fluids; fluid flow; Fracture; fracture network; Critical hydraulic gradient; fault displacement; Nonlinear flow; Reynolds number; Road construction; Rough-walled fractures; Shear displacement; shear flow; Shear flow; Shearing; Shearing machines; Transmissivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, information on the relationships between soil moisture at the surface and subsurface layers is relatively inadequate. The objective of this study was to examine the similarities in the overall and scale specific temporal patterns of soil moisture across soil profile. Soil moisture was measured at five soil depths using time-domain reflectometry in two sampling plots over 242 days in a karst depression. Spearman rank correlation and wavelet coherency analyzes were used to determine overall and scale-dependent similarities of temporal patterns of soil moisture, respectively. Results showed that soil moisture in farmland was higher than grassland especially in 10–50 cm depths. The surface depth had higher variability for both farmland and grassland. Spearman rank correlation coefficients between any two soil depths were significant, indicating strong depth persistence in the overall temporal pattern of soil moisture. The similarity decreased as the distance between depths increased. Wavelet coherency analysis indicated that soil moisture temporal pattern had a higher depth persistence in the farmland than grassland. Soil depth had a larger influence than land uses on the similarity in soil moisture temporal pattern, and the relative humidity and precipitation had larger effect than air temperature controlling the change of soil moisture at larger scales. These scale specific similarity in the temporal pattern of soil moisture can be used to guide estimating deeper soil moisture and to improve sampling strategies for soil moisture prediction with a higher prediction accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:29","2018-01-19 23:05:29","","659-669","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; catchment; hydrology; soil moisture; wavelet analysis; temporal analysis; Forecasting; Land use; karst hydrology; Catchments; sampling; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Landforms; precipitation (climatology); agricultural land; Farms; Moisture; grassland; karst; soil analysis; soil depth; time domain reflectometry; relative humidity; Humidity control; Karst landscape; Pedohydrology; Scale dependence; soil profile; Temporal scale; Wavelet coherency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Radioactive tracers, notably 14C, 3H, 36Cl, and the noble gases, together with other tracers whose concentrations vary over time, such as the chlorofluorocarbons or sulfur hexafluoride, are commonly used to estimate recharge rates. This review discusses some of the advantages and problems of using these tracers to estimate recharge rates. The suite of tracers allows recharge to be estimated over timescales ranging from a few years to several hundred thousand years, which allows both the long-term and modern behaviour of groundwater systems to be documented. All tracers record mean residence times and mean recharge rates rather than a specific age and date of recharge. The timescale over which recharge rates are averaged increases with the mean residence time. This is an advantage in providing representative recharge rates but presents a problem in comparing recharge rates derived from these tracers with those from other techniques, such as water table fluctuations or lysimeters. In addition to issues relating to the sampling and interpretation of specific tracers, macroscopic dispersion and mixing in groundwater flow systems limit how precisely groundwater residence times and recharge rates may be estimated. Additionally, many recharge studies have utilised existing infrastructure that may not be ideal for this purpose (e.g., wells with long screens that sample groundwater several kilometres from the recharge area). Ideal recharge studies would collect sufficient information to optimise the use of specific tracers and minimise the problems of mixing and dispersion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:35","2018-01-19 23:05:35","","797-811","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; Groundwater flow; lysimeter; Groundwater; dispersion; groundwater flow; geochemistry; Ground water recharge; recharge; Mixing; Isotopes; tracer; water table; Recharging (underground waters); mixing; Geochemistry; Groundwater geochemistry; Dispersions; residence time; Mean residence time; Sulfur hexafluoride; Recharge; Groundwater flow systems; Groundwater residence; Inert gases; Macroscopic dispersion; Mixing and dispersions; Radioactivity; Radioisotopes; radionuclide; Water table fluctuations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To the best of our knowledge, studies on assimilating multi-scale soil moisture data into a distributed hydrological model with a series of detailed vertical soil moisture profiles are rare. Our analysis factors include spatial measurement scales, soil spatial heterogeneity, multi-scale data with contrasting information and systematic measurement errors. Results show that coarse-scale soil moisture data are also very useful for identifying finer-scale parameters and states given biased initial parameter fields, but it becomes increasingly difficult to recover the finer-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil property as the observation grids become coarser. In state-only estimation, near-surface soil moisture data result in improvement for shallow soil moisture profiles and degradation for deeper soil moisture profiles, with stronger influences from finer-scale data. With the decrease of background spatial heterogeneity of soil property, the value of coarse-scale data increases notably. Soil moisture data at two scales with contrasting information are found to be both useful. By updating spatially correlated soil hydraulic parameters, deviated observations still contain considerably useful information for finer-scale state-parameter estimation. Eventually, by presenting a difference information assimilation method based on EnKF we successfully extract useful information from soil moisture data containing systematic measurement errors. The current study can be extended to consider more complex atmosphere input and topography, etc. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:38","2018-01-19 23:05:38","","912-925","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","soil moisture; data set; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; parameter estimation; hydrological modeling; parameterization; heterogeneity; Parameter estimation; Bandpass filters; Data assimilation; water flow; Flow of water; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; error analysis; Kalman filter; Soil surveys; Spatial variables measurement; Moisture; Distributed hydrological model; Kalman filters; Distributed hydrologic model; soil property; degradation; Soil hydraulic parameters; Measurement errors; Multi-scale soil moisture data; shallow soil; Slip forming; Soil moisture profiles; State parameter estimation; Systematic errors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities make optimal allocation more complex. An intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective non-linear programming (IFMONLP) model for irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions is developed to help decision makers mitigate water scarcity. The model is capable of quantitatively solving multiple problems including crop yield increase, blue water saving, and water supply cost reduction to obtain a balanced water allocation scheme using a multi-objective non-linear programming technique. Moreover, it can deal with uncertainty as well as hesitation based on the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Consideration of the combination of dry and wet conditions for water availability and precipitation makes it possible to gain insights into the various irrigation water allocations, and joint probabilities based on copula functions provide decision makers an average standard for irrigation. A case study on optimally allocating both surface water and groundwater to different growth periods of rice in different subareas in Heping irrigation area, Qing'an County, northeast China shows the potential and applicability of the developed model. Results show that the crop yield increase target especially in tillering and elongation stages is a prevailing concern when more water is available, and trading schemes can mitigate water supply cost and save water with an increased grain output. Results also reveal that the water allocation schemes are sensitive to the variation of water availability and precipitation with uncertain characteristics. The IFMONLP model is applicable for most irrigation areas with limited water supplies to determine irrigation water strategies under a fuzzy environment. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:40","2018-01-19 23:05:40","","80-94","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; Water resources; groundwater; surface water; sustainability; water availability; water supply; Groundwater; water resource; Agriculture; numerical model; Water; Crops; Water supply; Fuzzy rules; Water conservation; crop yield; Irrigation; irrigation system; Surface waters; human activity; precipitation (climatology); Sustainable development; rice; growth; natural resource; Cost reduction; Surface water and groundwaters; Nonlinear programming; Dry and wet conditions; Fuzzy sets; Guangdong; Heping; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic Fuzzy number; Irrigation water allocation; Joint probability; Limited water supplies; Water supply costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrometeorological networks are utilized to collect such data. Since data collection is expensive, it is essential to design an optimal network based on the minimal number of hydrometeorological stations in order to reduce costs. This study proposes a two-phase copula entropy- based multiobjective optimization approach that includes: (1) copula entropy-based directional information transfer (CDIT) for clustering the potential hydrometeorological gauges into several groups, and (2) multiobjective method for selecting the optimal combination of gauges for regionalized groups. Although entropy theory has been employed for network design before, the joint histogram method used for mutual information estimation has several limitations. The copula entropy-based mutual information (MI) estimation method is shown to be more effective for quantifying the uncertainty of redundant information than the joint histogram (JH) method. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by applying to one type of hydrometeorological gauge network, with the use of three model evaluation measures, including Nash–Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC), arithmetic mean of the negative copula entropy (MNCE), and MNCE/NSC. Results indicate that the two-phase copula entropy-based multiobjective technique is capable of evaluating the performance of regional hydrometeorological networks and can enable decision makers to develop strategies for water resources management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:42","2018-01-19 23:05:42","","228-241","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Water resources; Water resources management; gauge; optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Entropy; calibration; model validation; network analysis; Data acquisition; estimation method; hydrometeorology; Gages; Graphic methods; histogram; Hydrometeorological variables; Mutual informations; Hydrometeorological data; network design; Calibration and verification; Directional information; entropy; Gauge network; Mutual information estimations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was applied to evaluate non-stationary oscillatory modes of variability and trends, based on four time series of monthly-normalized discharge anomaly between 1940 and 2015. Statistically significant trends reveal increasing discharge during the past decades and document an intensification of the hydrological cycle during this period. An Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) analysis revealed that discharge variability in this region can be best described by five quasi-periodic statistically significant oscillatory modes, with mean periods varying from 1 to ∼20 y. Moreover, we show that discharge variability is most likely linked to the phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) at multi-decadal timescales (∼20 y) and, to a lesser degree, to the Tropical South Atlantic SST anomaly (TSA) variability at shorter timescales (∼2–5 y). Previous studies highlighted a rapid increase in discharge in the southern Central Andes during the 1970s, inferred to have been associated with the global 1976–77 climate shift. Our results suggest that the rapid discharge increase in the NW Argentine Andes coincides with the periodic enhancement of discharge, which is mainly linked to a negative to positive transition of the PDO phase and TSA variability associated with a long-term increasing trend. We therefore suggest that variations in discharge in this region are largely driven by both natural variability and the effects of global climate change. We furthermore posit that the links between atmospheric and hydrologic processes result from a combination of forcings that operate on different spatiotemporal scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:45","2018-01-19 23:05:45","","108-124","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Climate change; climate variation; hydrological cycle; river discharge; Climatology; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; time series analysis; Argentina; climate change; Climate variability; global change; Catchments; Mathematical transformations; Andes; climate forcing; River discharge; long-term change; Global climate changes; drainage basin; Atlantic Ocean (South); Central Andes; climate oscillation; decomposition analysis; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that: (i) the groundwater level decreased in areas close to drainage canals, while only negligible effects were found on the groundwater level in areas with no drainage canals; (ii) the influence of drainage canals on the groundwater level decreased as distance increased; and (iii) a drainage canal network design of a depth of 5 m, with canal configuration of north-south direction and canal spacing of 1000 m was more effective in reducing the groundwater level in the study area.

This synopsis focuses on aspects related to predicting changes to groundwater recharge conditions, with several common conclusions between the review articles being noted. The uncertainty of distribution and trend in future precipitation from General Circulation Models (GCMs) results in varying predictions of recharge, so much so that modelling studies are often not able to predict the magnitude and direction (increase or decrease) of future recharge conditions. Evolution of modelling approaches has led to the use of multiple GCMs and hydrologic models to create an envelope of future conditions that reflects the probability distribution. The choice of hydrologic model structure and complexity, and the choice of emissions scenario, has been investigated and somewhat resolved; however, recharge results remain sensitive to downscaling methods.

Geostatistical methods are often employed to map the free surface of an aquifer. In geostatistical analysis using Kriging techniques the selection of the optimal variogram is very important for the optimal method performance. This work compares three different criteria to assess the theoretical variogram that fits to the experimental one: the Least Squares Sum method, the Akaike Information Criterion and the Cressie's Indicator. Moreover, variable distance metrics such as the Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, Canberra and Bray-Curtis are applied to calculate the distance between the observation and the prediction points, that affects both the variogram calculation and the Kriging estimator. A Fuzzy Logic System is then applied to define the appropriate neighbors for each estimation point used in the Kriging algorithm. The two criteria used during the Fuzzy Logic process are the distance between observation and estimation points and the groundwater level value at each observation point. The proposed techniques are applied to a data set of 250 hydraulic head measurements distributed over an alluvial aquifer. The analysis showed that the Power-law variogram model and Manhattan distance metric within ordinary kriging provide the best results when the comprehensive geostatistical analysis process is applied. On the other hand, the Fuzzy Logic approach leads to a Gaussian variogram model and significantly improves the estimation performance. The two different variogram models can be explained in terms of a fractional Brownian motion approach and of aquifer behavior at local scale. Finally, maps of hydraulic head spatial variability and of predictions uncertainty are constructed for the area with the two different approaches comparing their advantages and drawbacks. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:53","2018-01-19 23:05:53","","242-252","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Kriging; Water resources; algorithm; groundwater; spatial analysis; Least squares approximations; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; Information management; fuzzy mathematics; Brownian motion; Brownian movement; Fractional brownian motion; Interpolation; kriging; geostatistics; variogram; water level; water table; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Spatial variability; hydraulic head; power law; Distance metrics; Fitting criteria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study has been carried out in Munneru river catchment, India, which is about 10,156 km2. In this study, an EnkF based new approach is proposed for improving the inherent vertical coupling of soil layers of SWAT hydrological model during soil moisture data assimilation. Evaluation of the vertical error correlation obtained between surface and subsurface layers indicates that the vertical coupling can be improved significantly using ensemble of soil storages compared to the traditional static soil storages based EnKF approach. However, the improvements in the simulated streamflow are moderate, which is due to the limitations in SWAT model in reflecting the profile soil moisture updates in surface runoff computations. Further, it is observed that the durability of streamflow improvements is longer when the assimilation system effectively updates the subsurface flow component.

In the present study, two long time series (∼20 years) of flood claims from property owners have been collected and analysed in detail to investigate the mechanisms and characteristics leading to urban flooding. The flood claim data come from the municipal water utility company and property owners with insurance that covers property loss from overland flooding, groundwater intrusion through basement walls and flooding from the drainage system. These data are used as a proxy for flood severity for several events in the Swedish city of Malmö. It is discussed which rainfall characteristics give most flooding and why some rainfall events do not lead to severe flooding, how city scale topography and sewerage system type influence spatial distribution of flood claims, and which impact high sea level has on flooding in Malmö. Three severe flood events are described in detail and compared with a number of smaller flood events. It was found that the main mechanisms and characteristics of flood extent and its spatial distribution in Malmö are intensity and spatial distribution of rainfall, distance to the main sewer system as well as overland flow paths, and type of drainage system, while high sea level has little impact on the flood extent. Finally, measures that could be taken to lower the flood risk in Malmö, and other cities with similar characteristics, are discussed. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:05:57","2018-01-19 23:05:57","","51-67","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Extreme precipitation; Rain; Risk assessment; rainfall; Floods; flooding; Groundwater; Spatial distribution; assessment method; spatial distribution; Insurance; Sewers; Precipitation (meteorology); Sea level; precipitation (climatology); urban planning; flood; Malmo; Skane; Sweden; Drainage systems; Urban flooding; Insurance claims; Drainage; drainage basin; overland flow; Long time series; Pluvial flooding; Property owners; Rainfall characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a combined field and modeling study to examine the potential links between groundwater flow and ecological zonation in a brackish marsh in the Yangtze River estuary. The intertidal marsh transect contained two plant zones (Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora) and an unvegetated mud flat adjacent to the estuary. Numerical simulations were conducted to quantify soil saturation index (SSI, ratio of saturated time to the whole observation period) for analyzing plant zonation. Models considered multiple factors, including aquifer stratification, anisotropy, evapotranspiration, surface topography (particularly slope breaks), seepage face formation and tidal loading. Simulations revealed that the average SSI over the rhizosphere depth from 0.0 m to 0.3 m increased abruptly by 11.4% at the interface of the two plant zones, and by another 10.5% at the riverward boundary of the vegetated zone. The significant increase of SSI was not caused by slope breaks but seepage face was responsible for the riverward increase of SSI.

Thermo-time domain reflectometry (thermo-TDR) probes can be used to determine θi based on the relationship between θi and soil heat capacity (C). This approach, however, is accurate in partially frozen soils only at temperatures below −5 °C, and it performs poorly on clayey soils. In this study, we present and evaluate a soil thermal conductivity (λ)-based approach to determine θi with thermo-TDR probes. Bulk soil λ is described with a simplified de Vries model that relates λ to θi. From this model, θi is estimated using inverse modeling of thermo-TDR measured λ. Soil bulk density (ρb) and thermo-TDR measured liquid water content (θl) are also needed for both C-based and λ-based approaches. A theoretical analysis is performed to quantify the sensitivity of C-based and λ-based θi estimates to errors in these input parameters. The analysis indicates that the λ-based approach is less sensitive to errors in the inputs (C, λ θl, and ρb) than is the C-based approach when the same or the same percentage errors occur. Further evaluations of the C-based and λ-based approaches are made using experimentally determined θi at different temperatures on eight soils with various textures, total water contents, and ρb. The results show that the λ-based thermo-TDR approach significantly improves the accuracy of θi measurements at temperatures ≤−5 °C. The root mean square errors of λ-based θi estimates are only half those of C-based θi. At temperatures of −1 and −2 °C, the λ-based thermo-TDR approach also provides reasonable θi, while the C-based approach fails. We conclude that the λ-based thermo-TDR method can reliably determine θi even at temperatures near the freezing point of water (0 °C). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:02","2018-01-19 23:06:02","","786-796","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","temperature; water content; Soils; error analysis; Errors; bulk density; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; Ice; Water content; Time domain reflectometry; Frozen soils; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; Time domain analysis; time domain reflectometry; thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity; Environmental applications; frozen ground; heat capacity; ice; Ice content; Liquid water content; Permittivity measurement; probe; Probes; Reflection; Reflectometers; Soil thermal conductivity; Specific heat; Thermo-TDR; Total water content","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study was conducted in a 7-ha potato-grain-forages rotation field in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada during 2011–2016 to link potato rotation practices and groundwater quality. The field consists of fine sandy loam soil and is underlain by 7–9 m of glacial till, which overlies the regional fractured “red-bed” sandstone aquifer. The water table is generally located in overburden close to the bedrock interface. Field treatments included one field zone taken out of production in 2011 with the remaining zones kept under a conventional potato rotation. Agronomy data including crop tissue, soil, and tile-drain water quality were collected. Hydrogeology data including multilevel monitoring of groundwater nitrate and hydraulic head and data from rock coring for nitrate distribution in overburden and bedrock matrix were also collected. A significant amount of nitrate leached below the soil profile after potato plant kill (referred to as topkill) in 2011, most of it from fertilizer N. A high level of nitrate was also detected in the till vadose zone through coring in December 2012 and through multilevel groundwater sampling from January to May 2014 in both cultivated and uncultivated field zones. Groundwater nitrate concentrations increased for about 2.5 years after the overlying potato field was removed from production. Pressure-driven uniform flow processes dominate water and nitrate transport in the vadose zone, producing an apparently instant water table response but a delayed groundwater quality response to nitrate leaching events. These data suggest that the uniform flow dominated vadose zone in agricultural landscapes can cause the accumulation of a significant amount of nitrate originated from previous farming activities, and the long travel time of this legacy nitrate in the vadose zone can result in substantially delayed responses of groundwater quality to field management adjustments. The delayed effects should also apply to the transport of other contaminants. This study also suggests that management practices should be optimized to reduce soil nitrate build-up during the non-growing season (when plant N uptake is diminishing and the soil contains excessive moisture, for example, after the potato harvest period in PEI) in order to protect groundwater quality. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:04","2018-01-19 23:06:04","","760-776","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; groundwater; Hydrogeology; water quality; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; nitrate; Water pollution; Agriculture; crop production; Crops; Cultivation; Canada; Soils; vadose zone; Plants (botany); Nitrates; Surface waters; River pollution; Rotation; Leaching; water table; bedrock; Eutrophication; Agricultural landscapes; crop rotation; Travel time; Solanum tuberosum; hydraulic head; breakthrough curve; Nitrate distribution; soil profile; Breakthrough; Groundwater contamination; Multi-level groundwaters; overburden; potato; Prince Edward Island [Canada]; Prince edward islands; sandy loam; Tile drains; Uniform flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intact porous medium is permeable because it contains numerous micro cracks and pores. These micro discontinuities construct a fluid channel network. The representative volume of this fluid channel network is modeled as a lattice bond cell with finite number of bonds in statistical sense. Each bond serves as a fluid channel. In fractured porous medium, many bond cells are cut by macro fractures. The conductivity of the fracture facet in a bond cell is taken over by the bonds parallel to the flow direction. The equivalent permeability and volumetric storage coefficient of a micro bond are calibrated based on the ideal bond cell conception, which makes it unnecessary to consider the detailed geometry of a specific element. Such parameter calibration method is flexible and applicable to any type of element. The accuracy check results suggest this method has a satisfying accuracy in both the steady and transient flow simulation. To simulate the massive fractures in rockmass, the bond cells intersected by fracture are assigned aperture values, which are assumed random numbers following a certain distribution law. By this method, any number of fractures can be implicitly incorporated into the background mesh, avoiding the setup of fracture element and mesh modification. The fracture aperture heterogeneity is well represented by this means.

However, previous applications have mostly relied on deterministic seawater intrusion (SWI) simulations. This is a questionable simplification, knowing that SWI models are inevitably prone to epistemic and aleatory uncertainty, and hence a management strategy obtained through S/O without consideration of uncertainty may result in significantly different real-world outcomes than expected. However, two key issues have hindered the use of uncertainty-based S/O schemes in CGM, which are addressed in this paper. The first issue is how to solve the computational challenges resulting from the need to perform massive numbers of simulations. The second issue is how the management problem is formulated in presence of uncertainty. We propose the use of Gaussian process (GP) emulation as a valuable tool in solving the computational challenges of uncertainty-based S/O in CGM. We apply GP emulation to the case study of Kish Island (located in the Persian Gulf) using an uncertainty-based S/O algorithm which relies on continuous ant colony optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, we show that GP emulation can provide an acceptable level of accuracy, with no bias and low statistical dispersion, while tremendously reducing the computational time. Moreover, five new formulations for uncertainty-based S/O are presented based on concepts such as energy distances, prediction intervals and probabilities of SWI occurrence. We analyze the proposed formulations with respect to their resulting optimized solutions, the sensitivity of the solutions to the intended reliability levels, and the variations resulting from repeated optimization runs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:08","2018-01-19 23:06:08","","518-534","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; Sensitivity analysis; Water management; algorithm; groundwater; optimization; simulation; Uncertainty; Monte Carlo methods; water management; Monte Carlo analysis; Groundwater; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Artificial intelligence; uncertainty analysis; Intelligent systems; Gaussian method; Ant colony optimization; Management strategies; Gaussian Processes; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Indian Ocean; Arabian Sea; Persian Gulf; Simulation optimization; Aleatory uncertainty; Computational challenges; Hormozgan; Kish Island; Statistical dispersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The way in which dams affect the organic and inorganic cycles in such systems is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal profiles of the various components of the water chemistry across three cascade dams in Japan: the Yamasubaru Dam, Saigou Dam, and Ohuchibaru Dam, which are situated along the sediment-productive Mimi River in different flow conditions. We analyzed the following water quality components: suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total iron (TFe), dissolved iron (DFe), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), humic substance (HS), and major ionic components (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, NO3−, and SO4 2−) in the downstream channels of the three dams during the low–intermediate-flow and high-flow events from 2012 to 2014. We estimated hourly loads of each component using hourly turbidity data and discharge data (i.e., L–Q model) separately, and the results are integrated to estimate the annual fluxes. The annual fluxes between the methods were compared to verify predictability of the conventional L–Q models. Annual flux of TOC, TN, DFe, and HS estimated by the turbidity displayed similar values, whereas the flux of SS, TFe, and TP tended to increase downstream of the dams. Among the dams, estimated flux proportions for TP and TFe were higher during high-flow events (74%–94%). Considering geographic conditions (e.g., absence of major tributary between the dams), the result implies that accumulated TP and TFe in the reservoirs may be flushed and transported downstream with SS over the short height dams during flood events. Assuming this process, the reservoir dams probably make only a fractional contribution to the organic and inorganic transport in the catchment studied. The percent flux errors for SS, TFe, and TP fluxes ranged from −7.2% to −97% (except for the TP flux in 2013), which highlights the risk of underestimating these components when using an L–Q model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:10","2018-01-19 23:06:10","","288-297","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dams; Water quality; catchment; river discharge; water quality; Rivers; Floods; iron; Catchments; river basin; Carbon; Organic carbon; flood; Reservoirs (water); Nutrients; water chemistry; organic matter; Biological materials; tributary; dam; Japan; Discharge modeling; Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus; Downstream channels; Geographic conditions; humic substance; Iron; Iron compounds; Longitudinal profile; Material transport; Quality components; Suspended solids; total organic carbon; Total Organic Carbon; Turbidity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, quantitatively integrating the information gained from acquiring geophysical data generally requires colocated lithological and geophysical data for constructing a rock-physics relationship. In this contribution, the issue of integrating noncolocated geophysical and lithological data is addressed, and the results are applied to simulate groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer in the Prairie Waters Project North Campus aquifer recharge site, Colorado. Two methods of constructing a rock-physics transform between electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data and lithology measurements are assessed. In the first approach, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to fit a bimodal lognormal distribution to horizontal crosssections of the ERT resistivity histogram. In the second approach, a spatial bootstrap is applied to approximate the rock-physics relationship. The rock-physics transforms provide soft data for multiple point statistics (MPS) simulations. Subsurface models are used to run groundwater flow and tracer test simulations. Each model's uncalibrated, predicted breakthrough time is evaluated based on its agreement with measured subsurface travel time values from infiltration basins to selected groundwater recovery wells. We find that incorporating geophysical information into uncalibrated flow models reduces the difference with observed values, as compared to flow models without geophysical information incorporated. The integration of geophysical data also narrows the variance of predicted tracer breakthrough times substantially. Accuracy is highest and variance is lowest in breakthrough predictions generated by the MLE-based rock-physics transform. Calibrating the ensemble of geophysically constrained models would help produce a suite of realistic flow models for predictive purposes at the site.

The assimilation, however, may harm the consistency between hydrological water fluxes, namely precipitation, evaporation, discharge, and water storage changes. To address this issue, we propose a weak constrained ensemble Kalman filter (WCEnKF) that maintains estimated water budgets in balance with other water fluxes. Therefore, in this study, GRACE terrestrial water storages data are assimilated into the World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3RA) hydrological model over the Earth's land areas covering 2002–2012. Multi-mission remotely sensed precipitation measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and evaporation products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as ground-based water discharge measurements are applied to close the water balance equation. The proposed WCEnKF contains two update steps; first, it incorporates observations from GRACE to improve model simulations of water storages, and second, uses the additional observations of precipitation, evaporation, and water discharge to establish the water budget closure. These steps are designed to account for error information associated with the included observation sets during the assimilation process. In order to evaluate the assimilation results, in addition to monitoring the water budget closure errors, in situ groundwater measurements over the Mississippi River Basin in the US and the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia are used. Our results indicate approximately 24% improvement in the WCEnKF groundwater estimates over both basins compared to the use of (constraint-free) EnKF. WCEnKF also further reduces imbalance errors by approximately 82.53% (on average) and at the same time increases the correlations between the assimilation solutions and the water fluxes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:15","2018-01-19 23:06:15","","447-462","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Rain; United States; Water budget; Water resources; GRACE; data set; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Bandpass filters; Data assimilation; Groundwater; uncertainty analysis; in situ measurement; Budget control; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; water storage; Digital storage; Errors; Hydrological modelling; Kalman filter; water budget; MODIS; Mississippi River; Rain gages; TRMM; Radiometers; Kalman filters; Satellite imagery; Evaporation; Murray-Darling Basin; Ensemble Kalman filtering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ERRIS applies a staged error model to reduce errors in hydrological simulations and to quantify prediction uncertainty. ERRIS produces probabilistic predictions, and is capable of propagating errors through multiple lead times to generate ensemble traces. In this study, we identify the need to model the residual distribution differently for rising and falling limbs of hydrographs when applying ERRIS to hourly streamflow forecasting. To address this need, ERRIS-h uses different distribution parameters for the two limbs. We evaluate ERRIS-h on eight rivers in Australia. Hourly streamflow simulations are produced by forcing an initialized GR4H hourly rainfall-runoff model with observed rainfall. We apply ERRIS-h to the streamflow simulations to produce ensemble streamflow predictions with lead times up to 48 h. The ensemble streamflow predictions here can be viewed as forecasts when rainfall forecasts are perfect. In this way, we test the ability of ERRIS-h to update forecasts using the most up-to-date streamflow observations and to generate ensemble traces that reflect hydrological uncertainty. As expected, ERRIS-h is highly effective when applied to the zeroth lead time, dramatically reducing errors in the original GR4H simulations and reliably describing forecast uncertainty. We also show that ERRIS-h ensemble forecasts have smaller errors than deterministic simulations at all lead times and are reliable in ensemble spread even at 48 h lead times. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:17","2018-01-19 23:06:17","","586-599","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Hydrographs; Rain; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; parameterization; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; uncertainty analysis; error analysis; Errors; hydrograph; ensemble forecasting; Stream flow; Streamflow forecasting; observational method; Ensemble prediction; Forecast verifications; Hydrological uncertainty; Lead time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their outputs could often be improved through the use of a statistical processor, opening up the question of the necessity of using both processors (meteorological and hydrological), only one of them, or none. This experiment compares the predictive distributions from four hydrological ensemble prediction systems (H-EPS) utilising the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) probabilistic sequential data assimilation scheme. They differ in the inclusion or not of the Distribution Based Scaling (DBS) method for post-processing meteorological forecasts and the ensemble Bayesian Model Averaging (ensemble BMA) method for hydrological forecast post-processing. The experiment is implemented on three large watersheds and relies on the combination of two meteorological reforecast products: the 4-member Canadian reforecasts from the Canadian Centre for Meteorological and Environmental Prediction (CCMEP) and the 10-member American reforecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), leading to 14 members at each time step. Results show that all four tested H-EPS lead to resolution and sharpness values that are quite similar, with an advantage to DBS + EnKF. The ensemble BMA is unable to compensate for any bias left in the precipitation ensemble forecasts. On the other hand, it succeeds in calibrating ensemble members that are otherwise under-dispersed. If reliability is preferred over resolution and sharpness, DBS + EnKF + ensemble BMA performs best, making use of both processors in the H-EPS system. Conversely, for enhanced resolution and sharpness, DBS is the preferred method. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:19","2018-01-19 23:06:19","","371-384","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","performance assessment; prediction; data assimilation; Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; calibration; hydrological change; experimental study; Probability distributions; Kalman filter; ensemble forecasting; hydrometeorology; reliability analysis; spatial resolution; Reliability; Predictive distributions; Ensemble prediction systems; Environmental prediction; Hydrological processor; Meteorological processor; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Optical resolving power; Performance; Sharpness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picos de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013–2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification.

Nitrate appears to remain conservative through the backwater reach at higher discharges (&gt;15,000 m3/s), thus, nitrate levels supplied from the catchment are those exported to the Gulf of Mexico, fueling coastal hypoxia. At lower discharges, interaction with fine sediments and organic matter stored on the bed due to estuarine and tidal processes, likely elevates nitrate levels prior to entering the Gulf: a further 1–2 week long spike in nitrate concentrations is associated with the remobilization of this sediments during the rising discharge phase of the Mississippi. Backwater characteristics are clearly observed in the study reach starting at river kilometer 703 (Vicksburg) in both longitudinal study periods. Stream power at the lowermost station is only 16% of that at Vicksburg in the high discharge survey, and 0.6% at low flow. The high-to-low discharge study differential in unit stream power at a station increases between Vicksburg and the lowermost station from a factor of 3 to 47–50 times. At high discharge, ∼30% of this energy loss can be ascribed to the removal of water to the Atchafalaya at Old River Control. Suspended sediment flux decreases downstream in the studied reach in both studies: the lowermost station has 75% of the flux at Vicksburg in the high discharge study, and 0.9% in the low discharge study. The high discharge values, given that this study was conducted during the highest rising hydrograph of the water year, are augmented by sediment resuspended from the bed that was deposited in the previous low discharge phase.

This study investigates this unexamined relationship between recharge, water table depths, and soil surface characteristics (nutrients) in a small sub-watershed in the northwestern Ethiopian highlands. These highland watersheds have high infiltration rates (mean 70 mm hr−1 median 33 mm hr−1), recharging the shallow unconfined hillslope aquifer with water transport occurring via subsurface pathways down the slope. The perched water tables reflect the subsurface flux and are deep where this flux is rapid in the upland areas (138 cm below surface). Soil saturation and overland flow occur when the subsurface flux exceeds the transport capacity of the soil in the lower downslope areas near the ephemeral stream (19 cm below surface). Land use is directly related to the water table depth, corresponding to grazing and fallowed (saturated) land in the downslope areas and cultivated (unsaturated) land in the middle and upper parts where the water table is deeper. Kjeldahl Total Nitrogen (TN), Bray II available phosphorus (AP), and exchangeable potassium (K+) averages exhibit different behaviors across slope, land use transects, or saturation conditions. TN was moderate to low (0.07% ± 0.04) in various land uses and slope regions.

However, streamflow transmission losses can vary significantly, partly due to spatiotemporal variations in streambed permeability. To extend our understanding of changes in streambed hydraulic properties, field investigations of streambed hydraulic conductivity were conducted in an ephemeral dryland stream in north-western China during high and low streamflow periods. Additionally, streamflow transmission losses were numerically estimated using combined stream and groundwater hydraulic head data and stream and streambed temperature data. An analysis of slug test data at two different river flow stages (one test was performed at a low river stage with clean water and the other at a high river stage with muddy water) suggested that sedimentation from fine-grained particles, i.e., physical clogging processes, likely led to a reduction in streambed hydraulic properties. To account for the effects of streambed clogging on changes in hydraulic properties, an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance during the slug test was considered to correct the estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity. The stream and streambed temperature can also greatly influence the hydraulic properties of the streambed. One-dimensional coupled water and heat flux modelling with HYDRUS-1D was used to quantify the effects of seasonal changes in stream and streambed temperature on streamflow losses. During the period from 6 August 2014 to 4 June 2015, the total infiltration estimated using temperature-dependent hydraulic conductivity accounted for approximately 88% of that using temperature-independent hydraulic conductivity. Streambed clogging processes associated with fine particle settling/wash up cycles during flow events, and seasonal changes in streamflow temperature are two considerable factors that affect water infiltration in ephemeral dryland streams. Our results show that time series measurements of stream and sediment temperature and surface and groundwater head can be used to effectively determine the seasonal dynamics of streambed water exchange. Such combined heat and head monitoring at field sites is useful for calibrating regional surface-groundwater models.

Especially, updating the development stage was able to avoid the negative effect of “phenological shift” which was caused by the contrasted phenological stage in different ensemble members. Simultaneous state-parameter estimation (SSPE) assimilation strategy outperformed updating-state-only (USO) assimilation strategy because of its ability to alleviate the inconsistency between model variables and parameters. However, the performance of SSPE assimilation strategy could deteriorate with an increasing number of uncertain parameters as a result of soil stratification and limited knowledge on crop parameters.

A method for emulating recharge and evapotranspiration processes in groundwater flow models was developed, and applied to the South East region of South Australia and western Victoria, which is characterised by shallow groundwater, wetlands and coastal lakes. The soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model WAVES was used to generate relationships between net recharge (diffuse recharge minus evapotranspiration from groundwater) and depth to water table for different combinations of climate, soil and land cover types. These relationships, which mimicked previously described soil, vegetation and groundwater behaviour, were combined into a net recharge lookup table. The segmented evapotranspiration package in MODFLOW was adapted to select values of net recharge from the lookup table depending on groundwater depth, and the climate, soil and land use characteristics of each cell. The model was found to be numerically robust in steady state testing, had no major increase in run time, and would be more efficient than tightly-coupled modelling approaches. It made reasonable predictions of net recharge and groundwater head compared with remotely sensed estimates of net recharge and a standard MODFLOW comparison model. In particular, the method was better able to predict net recharge and groundwater head in areas with steep hydraulic gradients. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:36","2018-01-19 23:06:36","","894-908","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Evapotranspiration; Vegetation; evapotranspiration; remote sensing; software; Uncertainty analysis; Victoria [Australia]; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Land use; numerical model; Remote sensing; uncertainty analysis; model validation; Forestry; groundwater flow; Soils; Soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models; shallow water; recharge; Computational performance; South Australia; water table; Recharging (underground waters); Vegetation properties; Groundwater Flow Model; Numerical models; Recharge; Depth to water tables; Evapotranspiration from groundwaters; Table lookup","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are many dams located within the Laurentian Great Lakes watershed whose operations have been adversely affected by excessive reservoir sedimentation.

In this research, the sediment accumulation rates of twelve reservoirs within the Great Lakes watershed were evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The estimated sediment accumulation rates by SWAT were compared to estimates relying on radionuclide dating of sediment cores and bathymetric survey methods. Based on the sediment accumulation rate, the remaining reservoir capacity for each study site was estimated. Evaluation of the anthropogenic impacts including land use change and dam construction on the sediment yield were assessed in this research.

The annual, measured tree interception losses (Im) of Q.i. and Q.p. in the first year were 51% and 16% of P (335 mm) and in the second, 46% and 10% of P (672 mm), respectively. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception loss, extrapolated well the Im temporal variability of Q.i. and Q.p., provided the throughfall-based, and not Pennman-Monteith-based, average wet canopy evaporation rates were used. Finally, a novel method of spatial upscaling of a tree-based interception loss into plot- and catchment-scale, using per-species, reference tree interception loss and object-attributes derived from satellite imagery, was proposed. The interception losses from Q.i. and Q.p. were upscaled first into two homogeneous plots (1-ha each and both with ∼20% canopy cover), one with Q.i. and the other with Q.p. oaks and then into the entire Sardon catchment with ∼7% canopy cover. The obtained annual-mean, plot interception losses were 9.5% of P in evergreen Q.i. and 2.5% of P in deciduous Q.p. plot. The annual-mean catchment interception loss was 1.4% of P.

The analysis is applied to Lower Manhattan, New York City, considering FEMA's 100- and 500-year flood scenarios and New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC2)’s high-end SLR projections for the 2050s and 2080s, using the current situation as the baseline scenario. Service areas for different response timeframes (3-, 5- and 8-min) and various traffic conditions are simulated for three major emergency responders (i.e. New York Police Department (NYPD), Fire Department, New York (FDNY) and Emergency Medical Service (EMS)) under normal and flood scenarios. The modelling suggests that coastal flooding together with SLR could result in proportionate but non-linear impacts on emergency services at the city scale, and the performance of operational responses is largely determined by the positioning of emergency facilities and the functioning of traffic networks. Overall, emergency service accessibility to the city is primarily determined by traffic flow speed.

Hydrological models can be a useful tool for the anticipation of these events and the issuing of timely warnings. One of the main challenges of setting up such a system is finding appropriate model parameter values for ungauged catchments. Previous studies have shown that the transfer of parameter sets from hydrologically similar gauged catchments is one of the best performing regionalization methods. However, a remaining key issue is the identification of suitable descriptors of similarity. In this study, we use decision tree learning to explore parameter set transferability in the full space of catchment descriptors. For this purpose, a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model is set up for 35 catchments in ten Chinese provinces. Hourly runoff data from in total 858 storm events are used to calibrate the model and to evaluate the performance of parameter set transfers between catchments. We then present a novel technique that uses the splitting rules of classification and regression trees (CART) for finding suitable donor catchments for ungauged target catchments. The ability of the model to detect flood events in assumed ungauged catchments is evaluated in series of leave-one-out tests. We show that CART analysis increases the probability of detection of 10-year flood events in comparison to a conventional measure of physiographic-climatic similarity by up to 20%. Decision tree learning can outperform other regionalization approaches because it generates rules that optimally consider spatial proximity and physical similarity. Spatial proximity can be used as a selection criteria but is skipped in the case where no similar gauged catchments are in the vicinity. We conclude that the CART regionalization concept is particularly suitable for implementation in sparsely gauged and topographically complex environments where a proximity-based regionalization concept is not applicable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:06:47","2018-01-19 23:06:47","","330-346","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Runoff; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; decision analysis; parameter estimation; hydrological modeling; Floods; runoff; Catchments; flash flood; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Decision trees; learning; Ungauged catchment; mountain region; Parameter regionalization; Decision tree learning; Flash flood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The trends are identified and quantified at monthly and annual scale at gauging stations with data collected for long periods (60–90 years). An ensemble of 13 Regional Climate Models (RCMs), based on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), was then used to assess local scale future precipitation and temperature projections and to represent the uncertainty in the results. The historical data highlight a general decrease of the annual rainfall at a mean rate of 22 mm per decade but, in many cases, the tendencies are not statistically significant. Conversely, the annual mean temperature exhibits an upward trend, statistically significant in the majority of cases, with a warming rate of about 0.1 °C per decade. With reference to the model projections and the annual precipitation, the results are not concordant; the deviations between models in the same period are higher than the future changes at medium- (2031–2040) and long-term (2051–2060) and highlight that the model uncertainty and variability is high. According to the climate model projections, the warming of the study area is unequivocal; a mean positive increment of 0.8 °C at medium-term and 1.1 °C at long-term is expected with respect to the reference period (2003–2012) and the scenario RCP4.5; the increments grow to 0.9 °C and 1.9 °C for the RCP8.5. Finally, in order to check the observed climate change signals, the climate model projections were compared with the trends based on the historical data.

However, few studies have assessed the uncertainty of gridded observation datasets from a drought monitoring perspective. This study provides a hydrologic modeling oriented analysis of the gridded observation data uncertainties over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and its implications on drought assessment. We utilized a recently developed 100-member ensemble-based observed forcing data to simulate hydrologic fluxes at 1/8° spatial resolution using Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and compared the results with a deterministic observation. Meteorological and hydrological droughts are studied at multiple timescales over the basin, and seasonal long-term trends and variations of drought extent is investigated for each case. Results reveal large uncertainty of observed datasets at monthly timescale, with systematic differences for temperature records, mainly due to different lapse rates. The uncertainty eventuates in large disparities of drought characteristics. In general, an increasing trend is found for winter drought extent across the PNW. Furthermore, a ∼3% decrease per decade is detected for snow water equivalent (SWE) over the PNW, with the region being more susceptible to SWE variations of the northern Rockies than the western Cascades.

Anaerobic pre-incubation of the sediments increased the effective rate of Cr reduction that was correlated with the increase in HCl-extractable Fe(II) content in the sediments. The reduced Cr was stable when exposed to O2 under field-relevant pH (7.5) with and without dissolved Mn(II), which might be oxidized to form Mn(III/IV) oxides that may oxidize reduced Cr. The Cr(VI) reduction rate showed a multi-rate behavior, apparently reflecting the presence of reductants with different reactivity in the sediments.

Current estimations of reservoir evaporative loss are dependent on water area derived from a reservoir storage-area curve. Such curves are unavailable if the reservoir is located in a data-sparse region or questionable if long-term sedimentation has changed the original elevation-area relationship. We propose a remote sensing framework to estimate reservoir evaporative loss at the regional scale. This framework uses a multispectral water index to extract reservoir area from Landsat imagery and estimate monthly evaporation volume based on pan-derived evaporative rates. The optimal index threshold is determined based on local observations and extended to unobserved locations and periods. Built on the cloud computing capacity of the Google Earth Engine, this framework can efficiently analyze satellite images at large spatiotemporal scales, where such analysis is infeasible with a single computer. Our study involves 200 major reservoirs in Texas, captured in 17,811 Landsat images over a 32-year period. The results show that these reservoirs contribute to an annual evaporative loss of 8.0 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 20% of their total active storage or 53% of total annual water use in Texas. At five coastal basins, reservoir evaporative losses exceed the minimum freshwater inflows required to sustain ecosystem health and fishery productivity of the receiving estuaries.

This study examines the clustering of Australian floods at different temporal scales and its possible physical mechanisms. Flood series with different severities are obtained by peaks-over-threshold (POT) sampling in four flood thresholds. At intra-annual scale, Cox regression and monthly frequency methods are used to examine whether and when the flood clustering exists, respectively. At inter-annual scale, dispersion indices with four-time variation windows are applied to investigate the inter-annual flood clustering and its variation. Furthermore, the Kernel occurrence rate estimate and bootstrap resampling methods are used to identify flood-rich/flood-poor periods. Finally, seasonal variation of horizontal wind at 850 hPa and vertical wind velocity at 500 hPa are used to investigate the possible mechanisms causing the temporal flood clustering. Our results show that: (1) flood occurrences exhibit clustering at intra-annual scale, which are regulated by climate indices representing the impacts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans; (2) the flood-rich months occur from January to March over northern Australia, and from July to September over southwestern and southeastern Australia; (3) stronger inter-annual clustering takes place across southern Australia than northern Australia; and (4) Australian floods are characterised by regional flood-rich and flood-poor periods, with 1987–1992 identified as the flood-rich period across southern Australia, but the flood-poor period across northern Australia, and 2001–2006 being the flood-poor period across most regions of Australia. The intra-annual and inter-annual clustering and temporal variation of flood occurrences are in accordance with the variation of atmospheric circulation. These results provide relevant information for flood management under the influence of climate variability, and, therefore, are helpful for developing flood hazard mitigation schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:03","2018-01-19 23:07:03","","744-759","","","555","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; atmospheric circulation; Climatology; climate change; Climate variability; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Meteorology; seasonal variation; dispersion; natural hazard; wind velocity; flood; annual variation; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Atmospheric circulation; Cox regression; Kernel estimation; Multi-temporal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to investigate the environmental effects of livestock manure application based on the SWAT model in the Xiangxi River watershed, which is one of the largest tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir in China. Three newly-built manure databases (NB) were created and applied to different subbasins based on the actual livestock manure discharging amount. The calibration and validation values of SWAT model outputs obtained from the NB manure application and the original mixed (OM) manure were compared. The study results are as follows: (1) The livestock industry of Xingshan County developed quickly between 2005 and 2015. The downstream of the Xiangxi River (Huangliang, Shuiyuesi and Xiakou) had the largest livestock amount, and largely accounted for manure, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) production (&gt;50%). (2) The NB manure application resulted in less phosphorus pollution (1686.35 kg for ORGP and 31.70 kg for MINP) than the OM manure application. Compared with the upstream, the downstream was influenced more by the manure application. (3) The SWAT results obtained from the NB manure had a better calibration and validation values than those from the OM manure. For ORGP, R2 and NSE values were 0.77 and 0.65 for the NB manure calibration; and the same values for the OM manure were 0.72 and 0.61, respectively. For MINP, R2 values were 0.65 and 0.62 for the NB manure and the OM manure, and the NSE values were 0.60 and 0.58, respectively. The results indicated that the built-in fertilizer database in SWAT has its limitation because it is set up for the simulation in the USA. Thus, when livestock manure is considered in a SWAT simulation, a newly built fertilizer database needs to be set up to represent the localized condition more accurately. The conclusions of this study would be instructive for livestock pollution simulations, and favorable for non-point source pollution prevention at the watershed scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:05","2018-01-19 23:07:05","","479-488","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; China; database; Rivers; Pollution; Water pollution; Agriculture; watershed; soil and water assessment tool; calibration; Watersheds; Soil and Water assessment tools; model validation; accuracy assessment; Pollution control; Calibration and validations; fertilizer application; Fertilizers; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; phosphorus; Phosphorus; SWAT model; nonpoint source pollution; Database systems; Non-point source pollution; Hubei; livestock; Manure applications; Manures; Parameters localization; Phosphorus pollution; Three gorges reservoir; Three Gorges Reservoir; Xiangxi River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The infiltration simulated by 5 models (i.e., SHIP (high) model, SHIP (middle) model, SHIP (low) model, Philip model and Parlange model) were compared based on numerical experiments and soil column experiments. In numerical experiments, SHIP (middle) and Parlange models had robust solutions for SHR infiltration simulation of 12 typical soils under different initial soil conditions. The absolute values of percent bias were less than 12% and the values of Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency were greater than 0.83. Additionally, in soil column experiments, infiltration rate fluctuated in a range because of non-uniform initial water content. SHIP (high) and SHIP (low) models can simulate an infiltration range, which successfully covered the fluctuation range of the observed infiltration rate.

As the world's largest reservoir, the storage capacity and flood control capacity of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has attracted widespread interest and academic debate for nearly 20 years. In this study, a model for calculating the dynamic capacity of a river-type reservoir is established based on data from 394 river cross sections and 2.5-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data of the TGR area. The storage capacity and flood control capacity of the TGR were analysed based on the scheduling procedures of a normal impoundment period. The results show that the static capacity of the TGR is 43.43 billion m3, the dynamic flood control capacity is 22.45 billion m3, and the maximum floodwater flow regulated by the dynamic capacity at Zhicheng is no more than 67,700 m3/s. This study supply new simulation method and up-to-date high-precision data to discuss the 20 years debate, and the results reveal the TGR design is conservative for flood control according to the Preliminary Design Report of the Three Gorges Project.

An adequate spatial distribution of hydrological gauging stations presents a lot of interest in linkage with the river regime characterization, water infrastructures design, water resources management and ecological survey. Due to the increase of riverside population and the associated flood risk, hydrological networks constantly need to be developed. This paper suggests taking advantage of kriging approaches to improve the design of a hydrometric network. The context deals with the application of an optimization approach using ordinary kriging and simulated annealing (SA) in order to identify the best locations to install new hydrometric gauges. The task at hand is to extend an existing hydrometric network in order to estimate, at ungauged sites, the average specific annual discharge which is a key basin descriptor. This methodology is developed for the hydrometric network of the transboundary Medjerda River in the North of Tunisia. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is adopted to delineate basin limits and centroids. The latter are adopted to assign the location of basins in kriging development. Scenarios where the size of an existing 12 stations network is alternatively increased by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 new station(s) are investigated using geo-regression and minimization of the variance of kriging errors. The analysis of the optimized locations from a scenario to another shows a perfect conformity with respect to the location of the new sites. The new locations insure a better spatial coverage of the study area as seen with the increase of both the average and the maximum of inter-station distances after optimization. The optimization procedure selects the basins that insure the shifting of the mean drainage area towards higher specific discharges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:43","2018-01-19 23:07:43","","971-982","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","GIS; Water resources; Water resources management; gauge; optimization; regression analysis; water management; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; water resource; spatial distribution; Catchments; Water levels; Discharge observations; Interpolation; kriging; Location; Surveys; hydrometry; Ordinary kriging; Gauging stations; Discharge rating curve; Geo-regression; Medjerda River; Network optimization; Optimization procedures; simulated annealing; Simulated annealing; Tunisia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the sampling strategies is the global random sampling and the other six are the stratified random sampling on the top, middle, toe, top + mid, top + toe and mid + toe slope positions. When each sampling strategy was applied, sample sizes were gradually reduced and each sampling size contained 3000 replicates. Under each sampling size of each sampling strategy, the relative errors (REs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) of the estimated hillslope mean SWC and correlation coefficients between the SWC and soil/terrain properties were calculated to quantify the accuracy and uncertainty. The results showed that the uncertainty of the estimations decreased as the sampling size increasing. However, larger sample sizes were required to reduce the uncertainty in correlation coefficient estimation than in hillslope mean SWC estimation. Under global random sampling, 12 randomly sampled sites on this hillslope were adequate to estimate the hillslope mean SWC with RE and CV ≤10%. However, at least 72 randomly sampled sites were needed to ensure the estimated correlation coefficients with REs and CVs ≤10%. Comparing with all sampling strategies, reducing sampling sites on the middle slope had the least influence on the estimation of hillslope mean SWC and correlation coefficients. Under this strategy, 60 sites (10 on the middle slope and 50 on the top and toe slopes) were enough to ensure the estimated correlation coefficients with REs and CVs ≤10%. This suggested that when designing the SWC sampling, the proportion of sites on the middle slope can be reduced to 16.7% of the total number of sites.

In this context, two LSMs, Noah version 3.3 (Noah3.3) and Catchment LSM version Fortuna 2.5 (CLSMF2.5) coupled with the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme are used to produce hydrological estimates over the region. The two LSMs were forced with different combinations of two reanalysis-based meteorological datasets from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications datasets (i.e., MERRA-Land and MERRA-2) and three observation-based precipitation datasets, generating a total of 16 experiments. Modeled evapotranspiration (ET), streamflow, and terrestrial water storage estimates were evaluated against the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) ET, in-situ streamflow observations, and NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) products, respectively. Results show that CLSMF2.5 provided better representation of the water budget variables than Noah3.3 in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient when considering all meteorological forcing datasets and precipitation datasets.

As pit lakes fill, hydrological and geochemical processes interact and these need to be understood for appropriate management actions to be implemented. Evaporation is important in the evolution of pit lakes as it acts to concentrate various constituents, controls water level and changes the thermal characteristics of the water body. Despite its importance, evaporation from pit lakes is poorly understood. To address this, we used an automated floating evaporation pan and undertook measurements at a pit lake over a 12 month period. We also developed a new procedure for correcting floating pan evaporation estimates to lake evaporation estimates based on surface temperature differences. Total annual evaporation was 2690 mm and reflected the strong radiation inputs, high temperatures and low humidity experienced in this region. Measurements were used to test the performance of evaporation estimates derived using both pan coefficient and aerodynamic modelling techniques. Daily and monthly evaporation estimates were poorly reproduced using pan coefficient techniques and their use is not recommended for such environments. Aerodynamic modelling was undertaken using a range of input datasets that may be available to those who manage pit lake systems. Excellent model performance was achieved using over-water or local over-land meteorological observations, particularly when the sheltering effects of the pit were considered. Model performance was reduced when off-site data were utilised and differences between local and off-site vapor pressure and wind speed were found to be the major cause. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:46","2018-01-19 23:07:46","","631-647","","","555","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","evaporation; modeling; data set; Models; hydrological modeling; Wind; wind velocity; Water levels; Lakes; water level; Aerodynamics; lake; surface temperature; measurement method; Evaporation; Geochemical process; Aerodynamic modelling; Evaporation pans; high temperature; Measurements; Meteorological observation; Mine voids; mining; open pit mine; Open pit mining; Pit lakes; Surface temperature difference; Thermal characteristics; void","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyzed statistical characteristics and trends of suspended sediment concentration (SCS), flow discharge (FD) and sediment particle sizes using data from 24 gage stations scattered throughout the United States. Analysis showed significant time- and location-specific differences of these variables. The median values of SSC, FD and percentage of particle sizes smaller than 63 µm (P63) for all 24 gage stations were found to be 510.236 mg l−1 (right skewed), 45.406 m3 s−1 (left skewed) and 78.648% (right skewed), respectively. Most of the stations exhibited significant trends (P &lt; 0.001) in daily SSC (18 stations; one increasing and 17 decreasing), FD (19 stations; seven increasing and 12 decreasing), and P63 (15 stations; five increasing and 10 decreasing) as well. Further, 46% of the stations exhibited significant trends in all three variables. The wash load significantly contributed (79.085 ± 11.343%) to sediment load recorded at the gage stations. Results of the study can be used for developing best watershed management practices which may call for local or regional planning based on natural (i.e., precipitation amount, type and erosivity, watershed area, and soil erodibility) and human-affected (i.e., land use and hydraulic structures and water resources management) factors governing the study variables. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:48","2018-01-19 23:07:48","","100-110","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Water resources; discharge; hydrology; Sedimentation; Sediments; concentration (composition); Land use; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; Watersheds; Water conservation; Erosion; particle size; basin management; soil erosion; Watershed hydrology; Soil conservation; Gages; sedimentation; Spatiotemporal variability; Particle size; Finite difference method; sediment yield; Sediment yields; Suspended sediments; Regional planning; suspended sediment; Flowmeters; Fluvial behavior; Soil erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed method is a novel combination of the ANFIS model with the firefly algorithm as an optimizer tool to construct a hybrid ANFIS-FFA model. The results of the ANFIS-FFA model is compared with the classical ANFIS model, which utilizes the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method in the Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) generation. The historical monthly streamflow data for Pahang River, which is a major river system in Malaysia that characterized by highly stochastic hydrological patterns, is used in the study. Sixteen different input combinations with one to five time-lagged input variables are incorporated into the ANFIS-FFA and ANFIS models to consider the antecedent seasonal variations in historical streamflow data. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (r) are used to evaluate the forecasting performance of ANFIS-FFA model. In conjunction with these metrics, the refined Willmott's Index (Drefined), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (ENS) and Legates and McCabes Index (ELM) are also utilized as the normalized goodness-of-fit metrics. Comparison of the results reveals that the FFA is able to improve the forecasting accuracy of the hybrid ANFIS-FFA model (r = 1; RMSE = 0.984; MAE = 0.364; ENS = 1; ELM = 0.988; Drefined = 0.994) applied for the monthly streamflow forecasting in comparison with the traditional ANFIS model (r = 0.998; RMSE = 3.276; MAE = 1.553; ENS = 0.995; ELM = 0.950; Drefined = 0.975). The results also show that the ANFIS-FFA is not only superior to the ANFIS model but also exhibits a parsimonious modelling framework for streamflow forecasting by incorporating a smaller number of input variables required to yield the comparatively better performance. It is construed that the FFA optimizer can thus surpass the accuracy of the traditional ANFIS model in general, and is able to remove the false (inaccurately) forecasted data in the ANFIS model for extremely low flows. The present results have wider implications not only for streamflow forecasting purposes, but also for other hydro-meteorological forecasting variables requiring only the historical data input data, and attaining a greater level of predictive accuracy with the incorporation of the FFA algorithm as an optimization tool in an ANFIS model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:07:58","2018-01-19 23:07:58","","263-276","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","streamflow; Optimization; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; seasonal variation; Stochastic systems; river system; forecasting method; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; hydrometeorology; Stream flow; index method; Streamflow forecasting; Seasonal variation; Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient; tropical environment; ANFIS-FFA; Fuzzy C means clustering; Malaysia; Pahang; Pahang River; Tropical environments; West Malaysia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to chemical weathering, karst systems are characterized by strong heterogeneity resulting in a complex flow and storage behaviour. Presently available karst modelling strategies account for the karstic heterogeneity but often a lack of data limits their applicability in data-scarce regions. In this study, a step-wise simulation approach with a semi-distributed karst model is proposed to characterize a karst aquifer at a data-scarce region in Southwest Iran and to evaluate the leakage potential related to a future dam construction project at a river that cuts through the aquifer. Observed groundwater level time series were applied to calibrate and validate the model. In order to avoid over-parameterization, the karst aquifer was split into three sections down the hydraulic gradient. At each section, groundwater level observations were used to iteratively calibrate the model from the first to the last section. A spatial split-sample test and sensitivity analysis served to evaluate the prediction performance and the identifiability of the model parameters. Finally, simple scenarios of the river infiltration into the aquifer were applied to evaluate the leakage potential of the aquifer for future dam constructions. The spatial split-sample test showed that the semi-distributed model provided reliable predictions but prediction performance and parameter identifiability decreased from the first towards the last aquifer section, most probably due to increased aquifer complexity and propagation of uncertainty from the up-gradient model section. Using sensitivity analysis, we also show that parameter sensitivities increase significantly if parameter estimation was applied simultaneously to all three aquifer subsections. Using the model to assess the leakage potential indicated that, without further technical measures, the all river flow would be able infiltrate into the aquifer and the dam would never be filled up completely. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:02","2018-01-19 23:08:02","","470-481","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dams; Iran; Sensitivity analysis; river flow; simulation; sensitivity analysis; parameter estimation; Rivers; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; Parameter estimation; Forecasting; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Potable water; infiltration; karst hydrology; Landforms; Digital storage; complexity; Semi-distributed model; dam construction; karst; Parameter identifiability; Weathering; leakage; Parameter sensitivities; Dam construction; Karst aquifer; Propagation of uncertainties; Semi-distributed modelling; Southwest Iran","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Broad spatial distributions of discharging groundwater are often difficult to measure directly. We present high resolution estimates of direct groundwater discharge across 43% of the Great Lakes coastline based on a water budget approach that uses hydroclimatic models and high-resolution hydrographic data available within the United States. We also integrate land use data to identify coastal areas vulnerable to high groundwater-borne nutrient loads. Estimated rates of direct groundwater discharge along the Great Lakes coast are highly variable, but generally are greatest for Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Almost one-third of Lake Erie's United States coastline is vulnerable to groundwater sources of nutrients. To assess uncertainties and limitations in our vulnerability analysis, a vulnerable site along Lake Erie was selected for detailed field measurements of direct groundwater discharge rates and nutrient fluxes. Measured discharge rates were significantly lower than water budget-based estimates (354 ± 25 m3 y−1 m−1 compared to 588 ± 181 m3 y−1 m−1). Dissolved phosphorous concentrations in the lakebed were elevated compared to onshore groundwater, while nitrate concentrations were lower, indicative of a highly reactive sediment-water interface. Some of the measured phosphorus may be locally sourced from desorption of legacy P or mineralization of organic matter in the lakebed, which our vulnerability framework does not include. Much of the land-derived nitrogen may be transformed along groundwater flow paths prior to discharge. While model-based estimates of direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to nutrient loading are important for managing Great Lakes water quality, direct field observations remain essential for quantifying fluxes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:04","2018-01-19 23:08:04","","331-341","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water budget; Water quality; groundwater; water quality; Uncertainty analysis; Groundwater flow; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Land use; nitrate; Nitrate concentration; vulnerability; Budget control; groundwater flow; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Michigan; lake water; Lakes; sediment-water interface; Ground water discharge; Nutrients; water budget; phosphorus; Phosphorus; Eutrophication; organic matter; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Lake Erie; nutrient budget; Great lakes; Phosphorous concentrations; Sediment water interface; Seepage meters; Vulnerability analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with the uncertainty associated with rainfall forecast, some meteorological organisations have developed products, such as ensemble forecasts. However, due to the intensive computational requirements of ensemble forecasts, the spatial resolution remains coarse. For example, Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS) data is freely available on a 1-degree grid (about 100 km), while those of the so-called High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) are available on a 2.5-km grid (about 40 times finer). Potential users are then left with the option of using either a high-resolution rainfall forecast without uncertainty estimation and/or an ensemble with a spectrum of plausible rainfall values, but at a coarser spatial scale. The objective of this study was to evaluate the added value of coupling the Gibbs Sampling Disaggregation Model (GSDM) with ECCC products to provide accurate, precise and consistent rainfall estimates at a fine spatial resolution (10-km) within a forecast framework (6-h). For 30, 6-h, rainfall events occurring within a 40,000-km2 area (Québec, Canada), results show that, using 100-km aggregated reference rainfall depths as input, statistics of the rainfall fields generated by GSDM were close to those of the 10-km reference field. However, in forecast mode, GSDM outcomes inherit of the ECCC forecast biases, resulting in a poor performance when GEPS data were used as input, mainly due to the inherent rainfall depth distribution of the latter product. Better performance was achieved when the Regional Deterministic Prediction System (RDPS), available on a 10-km grid and aggregated at 100-km, was used as input to GSDM. Nevertheless, most of the analyzed ensemble forecasts were weakly consistent. Some areas of improvement are identified herein. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:06","2018-01-19 23:08:06","","507-516","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; High resolution; Rain; rainfall; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; uncertainty analysis; accuracy assessment; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic systems; ensemble forecasting; spatial resolution; Image resolution; Disaggregation; precipitation intensity; Ensemble prediction systems; vertical distribution; Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA); Ensemble; Prediction systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated the potential for measuring discharge via various forms of remote sensing, primarily thermal imaging of flow velocities but also spectrally-based depth retrieval from passive optical image data. We acquired thermal image time series from bridges spanning five streams in Alaska and observed strong agreement between velocities measured in situ and those inferred by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), which quantified advection of thermal features by the flow. The resulting surface velocities were converted to depth-averaged velocities by applying site-specific, calibrated velocity indices. Field spectra from three clear-flowing streams provided strong relationships between depth and reflectance, suggesting that, under favorable conditions, spectrally-based bathymetric mapping could complement thermal PIV in a hybrid approach to remote sensing of river discharge; this strategy would not be applicable to larger, more turbid rivers, however. A more flexible and efficient alternative might involve inferring depth from thermal data based on relationships between depth and integral length scales of turbulent fluctuations in temperature, captured as variations in image brightness. We observed moderately strong correlations for a site-aggregated data set that reduced station-to-station variability but encompassed a broad range of depths. Discharges calculated using thermal PIV-derived velocities were within 15% of in situ measurements when combined with depths measured directly in the field or estimated from field spectra and within 40% when the depth information also was derived from thermal images. The results of this initial, proof-of-concept investigation suggest that remote sensing techniques could facilitate measurement of river discharge. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:09","2018-01-19 23:08:09","","490-506","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; discharge; satellite data; data set; time series analysis; remote sensing; Rivers; Remote sensing; Flow visualization; spatial variation; bathymetry; Bathymetry; monitoring system; brightness temperature; Alaska; River discharge; Velocity; Turbulence; Hydrographic surveys; Velocity measurement; spectral analysis; Bathymetric information; Depth-averaged velocities; Geometrical optics; Image acquisition; Infrared imaging; Particle image velocimetries; particle image velocimetry; Remote sensing techniques; Spectrally-based depth retrieval; Thermal LSPIV; Turbulent fluctuation; Velocimeters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluation results show that the improved GA method can significantly reduce the ineffectiveness of the GA in current use and could avoid the running of the turbines in the cavitation/vibration zone, thereby ensuring the safety of the turbines during generating operations. Further, the analysis comparing the performance of the IGA and DP show that the IGA is superior to DP when a small number of turbines are involved. However, as the number of turbines increases, the IGA requires more calculation time than DP; moreover, its calculation accuracy and convergence rate are significantly reduced. It is difficult to guarantee the stability of IGA in high-dimension space even though the population grows, on account of the exponential expansion of the calculation dimension, the algorithm's premature convergence, and the lack of a local search capability.

However, the highly-parameterized nature of the geostatistical inversion approach renders it computationally intensive for large-scale investigations. In addition, geostatistics-based THT may produce overly smooth tomograms when head data used to constrain the inversion is limited. Therefore, alternative model conceptualizations for THT need to be examined. To investigate this, we simultaneously calibrated different groundwater models with varying parameterizations and zonations using two cases of different pumping and monitoring data densities from a laboratory sandbox. Specifically, one effective parameter model, four geology-based zonation models with varying accuracy and resolution, and five geostatistical models with different prior information are calibrated. Model performance is quantitatively assessed by examining the calibration and validation results. Our study reveals that highly parameterized geostatistical models perform the best among the models compared, while the zonation model with excellent knowledge of stratigraphy also yields comparable results. When few pumping tests with sparse monitoring intervals are available, the incorporation of accurate or simplified geological information into geostatistical models reveals more details in heterogeneity and yields more robust validation results. However, results deteriorate when inaccurate geological information are incorporated. Finally, our study reveals that transient inversions are necessary to obtain reliable K and Ss estimates for making accurate predictions of transient drawdown events. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:26","2018-01-19 23:08:26","","758-779","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","parameterization; heterogeneity; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; comparative study; calibration; conceptual framework; spatial distribution; model validation; accuracy assessment; Digital storage; Parameterization; hydraulic conductivity; Model calibration and validation; laboratory method; aquifer characterization; Stratigraphy; Geology; tomography; Inverse problems; Hydraulic conductivity; drawdown; Tomography; Transient analysis; Aquifer heterogeneity; Geological information; Hydraulic tomographies; Inverse modeling; Model comparison","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is focused on possible theoretical maximum gain in accuracy of estimates of upper quantiles, that can be obtained by incorporating the largest historical floods of known return periods into the FFA. We assumed a simple case: N years of systematic records of annual maximum flows and either one largest (XM1) or two largest (XM1 and XM2) flood peak flows in a historical M-year long period. The problem is explored by Monte Carlo simulations with the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Both correct and false distributional assumptions are considered. In the first case the two-parameter extreme value models (Gumbel, log-Gumbel, Weibull) with various coefficients of variation serve as parent distributions. In the case of unknown parent distribution, the Weibull distribution was assumed as estimating model and the truncated Gumbel as parent distribution. The return periods of XM1 and XM2 are determined from the parent distribution. The results are then compared with the case, when return periods of XM1 and XM2 are defined by their plotting positions. The results are presented in terms of bias, root mean square error and the probability of overestimation of the quantile with 100-year return period. The results of the research indicate that the maximal profit of inclusion of pre-instrumental foods in the FFA may prove smaller than the cost of reconstruction of historical hydrological information. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:33","2018-01-19 23:08:33","","800-816","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Maximum likelihood estimation; simulation; Flood frequency analysis; Monte Carlo methods; Monte Carlo analysis; Floods; Flood control; Intelligent systems; error analysis; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; flood; return period; Weibull distribution; flood frequency; Maximum likelihood; Error analysis; Coefficients of variations; Historical information; Reliability analysis; Historical floods; Maximum gain; Maximum likelihood methods; Pre-instrumental floods; Profitability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, with increasing evidence of climate change, it is possible that the assumption of stationarity, which is prerequisite for traditional frequency analysis and hence, the results of conventional analysis would become questionable. In this study, we consider a framework for frequency analysis of extremes based on B-Spline quantile regression which allows to model data in the presence of non-stationarity and/or dependence on covariates with linear and non-linear dependence. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to estimate quantiles and their posterior distributions. A coefficient of determination and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for quantile regression are used in order to select the best model, i.e. for each quantile, we choose the degree and number of knots of the adequate B-spline quantile regression model. The method is applied to annual maximum and minimum streamflow records in Ontario, Canada. Climate indices are considered to describe the non-stationarity in the variable of interest and to estimate the quantiles in this case.

In this study, an innovative method for regional rainfall frequency analysis for ungauged sites is presented. The new method (hereafter, this is called the RRFA-S) is based on corrected annual maximum series obtained from a satellite precipitation product (e.g., PERSIANN-CDR). The probability matching method (PMM) is used here for bias correction to match the CDF of satellite-based precipitation data with the gauged data. The RRFA-S method was assessed through a comparative study with the traditional index flood method using the available annual maximum series of daily rainfall in two different regions in USA (11 sites in Colorado and 18 sites in California). The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to represent the ungauged site condition.

Specifically, a bespoke integrated model developed in previous studies has been modified in order to include the micropollutant assessment (namely, sulfamethoxazole – SMX). The model takes into account also the interactions between the three components of the system: sewer system (SS), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and receiving water body (RWB). The analysis has been applied to an experimental catchment nearby Palermo (Italy): the Nocella catchment. Overall, five scenarios, each characterized by different uncertainty combinations of sub-systems (i.e., SS, WWTP and RWB), have been considered applying, for the sensitivity analysis, the Extended-FAST method in order to select the key factors affecting the RWB quality and to design a reliable/useful experimental campaign. Results have demonstrated that sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool for increasing operator confidence in the modelling results. The approach adopted here can be used for blocking some non-identifiable factors, thus wisely modifying the structure of the model and reducing the related uncertainty. The model factors related to the SS have been found to be the most relevant factors affecting the SMX modeling in the RWB when all model factors (scenario 1) or model factors of SS (scenarios 2 and 3) are varied. If the only factors related to the WWTP are changed (scenarios 4 and 5), the SMX concentration in the RWB is mainly influenced (till to 95% influence of the total variance for SSMX,max) by the aerobic sorption coefficient. A progressive uncertainty reduction from the upstream to downstream was found for the soluble fraction of SMX in the RWB. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:50","2018-01-19 23:08:50","","397-405","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Sicily; Water quality; catchment; sensitivity analysis; Monte Carlo methods; water quality; Uncertainty analysis; Rivers; Monte Carlo analysis; integrated approach; numerical model; numerical method; assessment method; uncertainty analysis; pollutant transport; Catchments; experimental study; Intelligent systems; Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis; urban drainage; Quality control; Wastewater treatment; Wastewater treatment plants; Experimental catchments; Receiving water bodies; Mathematical models; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Experimental campaign; Palermo [Sicily]; Uncertainty reduction; Urban water qualities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, Afghanistan faces an ancient history of water supply fluctuations that have contributed to periodic food shortage and famine. Poorly designed and weakly enforced water allocation methods continue to result in agriculture sector underperformance and periodic food shortages when water shortfalls occur. To date, little research has examined alternative water sharing rules on a multi-basin scale to protect food security for a subsistence irrigation society when the community faces water shortage. This paper's contribution examines the economic performance of three water-sharing mechanisms for three basins in Afghanistan with the goal of protecting food security for crop irrigation under ongoing threats of drought, while meeting growing demands for food in the face of anticipated population growth. We achieved this by formulating an integrated empirical optimization model to identify water-sharing measures that minimize economic losses while protecting food security when water shortages occur. Findings show that implementation of either a water trading policy or a proportional shortage policy that respects cultural sensitivities has the potential to raise economic welfare in each basin. Such a policy can reduce food insecurity risks for all trading provinces within each basin, thus being a productive institution for adapting to water shortage when it occurs. Total economic welfare gains are highest when drought is the most severe for which suffering would otherwise be greatest. Gains would be considerably higher if water storage reservoirs were built to store wet year flows for use in dry years. Our results light a path for policy makers, donors, water administrators, and farm managers, who shoulder the burden of protecting food security and rural livelihoods in the world's poor dry communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:08:56","2018-01-19 23:08:56","","200-215","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water management; water supply; climate change; water management; Drought; Optimization; Agriculture; Food supply; watershed; economic conditions; policy making; Watersheds; Water supply; food security; Irrigation; irrigation system; water storage; agricultural management; Population statistics; Reservoirs (water); water budget; demand analysis; Commerce; population growth; Public policy; crop plant; environmental policy; Alternative waters; Afghanistan; Agriculture sectors; drought stress; Economic performance; Empirical optimization; Food security; Losses; Supply fluctuations; Three Afghan basins; welfare economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two major categories of change examined are conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization, both of which have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Techniques for identifying and quantifying the changes in recharge due to these impacts are discussed. Land-clearing for agriculture and surface water transfer for irrigation have resulted in order of magnitude increases in recharge rates in many semi-arid regions worldwide, causing ongoing land and water salinization and water-logging problems. While increased recharge by irrigation return flow may alleviate shallow groundwater depletion in some settings, this is complicated by the effect of unsaturated zone thickening, which reduces the fraction of potential recharge becoming actual recharge, and may result in new water quality risks such as nitrate contamination. Expansion of urban and peri-urban land and their associated surface and sub-surface infrastructure results in complex water balance changes that re-distribute groundwater recharge locations, modify recharge mechanism(s) and result in variable impacts on recharge rates (e.g., overall net decrease, increase or minimal change) and quality. While changes to groundwater recharge resulting from conversion of land for agriculture are relatively well understood, less is documented about the changes resulting from urbanization, due to a paucity of data from field-based studies. Two case studies from Beijing, China and Melbourne Australia are examined, which highlight these impacts and demonstrate some potential methodological techniques for this topic. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:03","2018-01-19 23:09:03","","545-557","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; China; Water quality; groundwater; urbanization; Urbanization; water quality; Victoria [Australia]; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Land use; Water pollution; Agriculture; Irrigation; irrigation system; vadose zone; landscape change; Surface waters; land use change; quantitative analysis; water budget; Ground water recharge; recharge; Land-use change; Recharging (underground waters); Agricultural irrigation; Beijing [China]; Melbourne; Beijing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reliable estimates of such events are necessary as structures for flood conveyance are continuously evolving in size and complexity and, as a result, their failure-associated hazards become more and more pronounced. Due to this fact, several estimation techniques intended to improve flood frequency analysis and reducing uncertainty in extreme quantile estimation have been addressed in the literature in the last decades. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian framework for the indirect estimation of extreme flood quantiles from rainfall-runoff models. In the proposed approach, an ensemble of long daily rainfall series is simulated with a stochastic generator, which models extreme rainfall amounts with an upper-bounded distribution function, namely, the 4-parameter lognormal model. The rationale behind the generation model is that physical limits for rainfall amounts, and consequently for floods, exist and, by imposing an appropriate upper bound for the probabilistic model, more plausible estimates can be obtained for those rainfall quantiles with very low exceedance probabilities. Daily rainfall time series are converted into streamflows by routing each realization of the synthetic ensemble through a conceptual hydrologic model, the Rio Grande rainfall-runoff model. Calibration of parameters is performed through a nonlinear regression model, by means of the specification of a statistical model for the residuals that is able to accommodate autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity and nonnormality. By combining the outlined steps in a Bayesian structure of analysis, one is able to properly summarize the resulting uncertainty and estimating more accurate credible intervals for a set of flood quantiles of interest. The method for extreme flood indirect estimation was applied to the American river catchment, at the Folsom dam, in the state of California, USA. Results show that most floods, including exceptionally large non-systematic events, were reasonably estimated with the proposed approach. In addition, by accounting for uncertainties in each modeling step, one is able to obtain a better understanding of the influential factors in large flood formation dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:08","2018-01-19 23:09:08","","137-154","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Regression analysis; Runoff; United States; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; Flood frequency analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Inference engines; Hydrologic modeling; Catchments; Distribution functions; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Brazil; river basin; Rainfall-runoff modeling; stochasticity; estimation method; California; flood; Bayesian inference; flood frequency; Probability; Frequency estimation; Probabilistic modeling; Extreme flood; Folsom Lake; Nonlinear regression models; Rio Grande [Brazil]; Stochastic generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research suggests that high water table positions after wildfire are critical to limit atmospheric carbon losses and enable the re-establishment of keystone peatland mosses (i.e. Sphagnum). Post-fire recovery of the moss surface in Sphagnum-feathermoss peatlands, however, has been shown to be limited where moss type and burn severity interact to result in a water repellent surface. While in situ measurements of moss water repellency in peatlands have been shown to be greater for feathermoss in both a burned and unburned state in comparison to Sphagnum moss, it is difficult to separate the effect of water content from species. Consequently, we carried out a laboratory based drying experiment where we compared the water repellency of two dominant peatland moss species, Sphagnum and feathermoss, for several burn severity classes including unburned samples. The results suggest that water repellency in moss is primarily controlled by water content, where a sharp threshold exists at gravimetric water contents (GWC) lower than ∼1.4 g g−1. While GWC is shown to be a strong predictor of water repellency, the effect is enhanced by burning. Based on soil water retention curves, we suggest that it is highly unlikely that Sphagnum will exhibit strong hydrophobic conditions under field conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:13","2018-01-19 23:09:13","","656-665","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; wildfire; biomass burning; climate change; water content; Groundwater; Soil moisture; soil water; Carbon; disturbance; Fires; Wildfire; water table; Wetlands; Bryophyta; peatland; Sphagnum; Water content; Feathermoss; keystone species; moss; Moss; Peatland; repellent; Water repellency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results show that the LM-SEP yields the poorest streamflow predictions with the widest uncertainty band and unrealistic negative flows. The NL and BC methods can better deal with the heteroscedasticity and hence their corresponding predictive performances are improved, yet the negative flows cannot be avoided.

However, practical implementations of these approaches are still scarce, with a key limitation being the difficulty of generating a range of plausible future time series of hydro-meteorological data. In this study we apply a recently developed inverse stochastic generation approach to support the scenario-neutral analysis, and thus identify the key hydro-meteorological variables to which the system is most sensitive. The stochastic generator simulates synthetic hydro-meteorological time series that represent plausible future changes in (1) the average, extremes and seasonal patterns of rainfall; and (2) the average values of temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (uz) as variables that drive PET. These hydro-meteorological time series are then fed through a conceptual rainfall-runoff model to simulate the potential changes in runoff as a function of changes in the hydro-meteorological variables, and runoff sensitivity is assessed with both correlation and Sobol’ sensitivity analyses. The method was applied to a case study catchment in South Australia, and the results showed that the most important hydro-meteorological attributes for runoff were winter rainfall followed by the annual average rainfall, while the PET-related meteorological variables had comparatively little impact. The high importance of winter rainfall can be related to the winter-dominated nature of both the rainfall and runoff regimes in this catchment. The approach illustrated in this study can greatly enhance our understanding of the key hydro-meteorological attributes and processes that are likely to drive catchment runoff under a changing climate, thus enabling the design of tailored climate impact assessments to specific water resource systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:25","2018-01-19 23:09:25","","317-330","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Climate change; Rain; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Water resources; catchment; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; temperature; climate change; Wind; water resource; Meteorology; integrated approach; runoff; scenario analysis; Catchments; wind velocity; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; stochasticity; climate effect; hydrometeorology; South Australia; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; relative humidity; Climate exposure space; Climate impacts; Inverse approach; Scenario-neutral; Stochastic generator","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To circumvent the conventional rating curve development approach, Perumal et al. in 2007 and 2010 applied the Variable Parameter Muskingum Stage-hydrograph (VPMS) routing method for developing stage-discharge relationships especially at those ungauged river sites where stage measurements and details of section geometry are available, but discharge measurements are not made. The VPMS method enables to estimate rating curves at ungauged river sites with acceptable accuracy. But the application of the method is subjected to the limitation of negligible presence of lateral flow within the routing reach. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an extension of the VPMS method, henceforth, known herein as the VPMS-Lin method, for enabling the streamflow assessment even when significant lateral inflow occurs along the river reach considered for routing. The lateral inflow is estimated through the continuity equation expressed in the characteristic form as advocated by Barbetta et al. in 2012. The VPMS-Lin, is tested on two rivers characterized by different geometric and hydraulic properties: 1) a 50 km reach of the Tiber River in (central Italy) and 2) a 73 km reach of the Godavari River in the peninsular India. The study demonstrates that both the upstream and downstream discharge hydrographs are well reproduced, with a root mean square error equal on average to about 35 and 1700 m3 s−1 for the Tiber River and the Godavari River case studies, respectively. Moreover, simulation studies carried out on a river stretch of the Tiber River using the one-dimensional hydraulic model MIKE11 and the VPMS-Lin models demonstrate the accuracy of the VMPS-Lin model, which besides enabling the estimation of streamflow, also enables the estimation of reach averaged optimal roughness coefficients for the considered routing events. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:32","2018-01-19 23:09:32","","216-232","","","554","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; methodology; river discharge; river flow; streamflow; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Hydraulic models; numerical method; river water; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; flood; Stream flow; inflow; India; river channel; Rating; rating curve; River discharge; Discharge measurements; Rating curve; River flow measurement; Flow measurement; Godavari River; Lateral inflow; Prismatic channel; Roughness coefficient; stage-discharge relationship; Tiber River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, relatively little guidance exists with regard to the proper specification of the magnitude of the perturbation and the ensemble size, posing a significant challenge in optimally implementing the EnKF. This paper presents a robust data assimilation system (RDAS), in which a multi-factorial design of the EnKF experiments is first proposed for hydrologic ensemble predictions. A multi-way analysis of variance is then used to examine potential interactions among factors affecting the EnKF experiments, achieving optimality of the RDAS with maximized performance of hydrologic predictions. The RDAS is applied to the Xiangxi River watershed which is the most representative watershed in China's Three Gorges Reservoir region to demonstrate its validity and applicability. Results reveal that the pairwise interaction between perturbed precipitation and streamflow observations has the most significant impact on the performance of the EnKF system, and their interactions vary dynamically across different settings of the ensemble size and the evapotranspiration perturbation. In addition, the interactions among experimental factors vary greatly in magnitude and direction depending on different statistical metrics for model evaluation including the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and the Box–Cox transformed root-mean-square error. It is thus necessary to test various evaluation metrics in order to enhance the robustness of hydrologic prediction systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:37","2018-01-19 23:09:37","","743-757","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; evapotranspiration; prediction; streamflow; Uncertainty; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Bandpass filters; Data assimilation; Forecasting; perturbation; Watersheds; uncertainty analysis; experimental study; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; variance analysis; Kalman filter; stochasticity; Mean square error; Stream flow; Kalman filters; Hubei; Ensemble prediction; Three Gorges Reservoir; dynamic property; Interaction; Xiangxi Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The redox potential of groundwater is indicative of the biodegradation of hydrocarbons and is important in delineating the shapes of contaminant plumes. The self-potential method was used to reconstruct the redox potential of groundwater associated with an organic-rich contaminant plume in northern France. The self-potential technique is a passive technique consisting in recording the electrical potential distribution at the surface of the Earth. A self-potential map is essentially the sum of two contributions, one associated with groundwater flow referred to as the electrokinetic component, and one associated with redox potential anomalies referred to as the electroredox component (thermoelectric and diffusion potentials are generally negligible). A groundwater flow model was first used to remove the electrokinetic component from the observed self-potential data. Then, a residual self-potential map was obtained. The source current density generating the residual self-potential signals is assumed to be associated with the position of the water table, an interface characterized by a change in both the electrical conductivity and the redox potential. The source current density was obtained through an inverse problem by minimizing a cost function including a data misfit contribution and a regularizer. This inversion algorithm allows the determination of the vertical and horizontal components of the source current density taking into account the electrical conductivity distribution of the saturated and non-saturated zones obtained independently by electrical resistivity tomography. The redox potential distribution was finally determined from the inverted residual source current density. A redox map was successfully built and the estimated redox potential values correlated well with in-situ measurements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:43","2018-01-19 23:09:43","","111-127","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; France; Biodegradation; groundwater flow; data acquisition; biodegradation; redox potential; geophysics; electrical conductivity; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; Inverse problems; Contaminated sites; inverse problem; phreatic zone; Electric conductivity; plume; Cost functions; Redox reactions; Hydrocarbons; Current density; Electrical conductivity distribution; Electrical potential distribution; Electrodynamics; electrokinesis; hydrocarbon; Hydrocarbon contaminants; Hydrogeophysics; Redox potentials; self potential; Self potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has shown that future changes to such events could far exceed expectations based on temperature scaling and basic physical principles alone, but that computationally expensive convection-permitting models are required to accurately simulate sub-daily extreme rainfall events. It is therefore crucial to be able to model future changes to sub-daily duration extreme rainfall events as cost effectively as possible, especially in Australia where such information is scarce. In this study, we seek to determine what the shortest duration of extreme rainfall is that can be simulated by a less computationally expensive convection-parametrizing Regional Climate Model (RCM). We examine the ability of the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM), a ∼10 km high-resolution convection-parametrizing RCM, to reproduce sub-daily Intensity-Frequency-Duration (IFD) curves corresponding to two long-term observational stations in the Australian island state of Tasmania, and examine the future model projections. We find that CCAM simulates observed extreme rainfall statistics well for 3-h durations and longer, challenging the current understanding that convection-permitting models are needed to accurately model sub-daily extreme rainfall events. Further, future projections from CCAM for the end of this Century show that extreme sub-daily rainfall intensities could increase by more than 15% per °C, far exceeding the 7% scaling estimate predicted by the Clausius-Clapeyron vapour pressure relationship and the 5% scaling estimate recommended by the Australian Rainfall and Runoff guide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:09:49","2018-01-19 23:09:49","","277-291","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Climate change; Rain; Regional climate modeling; rainfall; Extremes; climate modeling; regional climate; climate change; parameterization; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; extreme event; future prospect; flood; frequency analysis; Depth-duration; precipitation intensity; Regional climate modeling (RCM); Australian rainfall and runoffs; Daily rainfall; Intensity-Frequency-Duration; island state; Sub-daily rainfall intensities; Tasmania; vapor pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By solving the global flow field by FEM before velocity computation, this method can capture the global information of the whole study region so as to ensure the subproblem solution accuracy by Yeh's model. After one subproblem has been solved, the DDFEM employs refraction law to obtain the Dirichlet boundary velocities of the adjacent subdomains.

Precise estimation of precipitation is required to manage and plan water resources, as well as other related applications such as hydrology, climatology, meteorology and agriculture. Time series of hydrologic variables such as precipitation are composed of deterministic and stochastic parts. Despite this fact, the stochastic part of the precipitation data is not usually considered in modeling of precipitation process. As an innovation, the present study introduces three new hybrid models by integrating soft computing methods including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Bayesian networks (BN) and gene expression programming (GEP) with a time series model, namely generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) for modeling of the monthly precipitation. For this purpose, the deterministic (obtained by soft computing methods) and stochastic (obtained by GARCH time series model) parts are combined with each other. To carry out this research, monthly precipitation data of Babolsar, Bandar Anzali, Gorgan, Ramsar, Tehran and Urmia stations with different climates in Iran were used during the period of 1965–2014. Root mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and determination coefficient (R2) were employed to evaluate the performance of conventional/single MARS, BN and GEP, as well as the proposed MARS-GARCH, BN-GARCH and GEP-GARCH hybrid models. It was found that the proposed novel models are more precise than single MARS, BN and GEP models. Overall, MARS-GARCH and BN-GARCH models yielded better accuracy than GEP-GARCH. The results of the present study confirmed the suitability of proposed methodology for precise modeling of precipitation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:00","2018-01-19 23:10:00","","721-742","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; Time series; Water resources; algorithm; modeling; regression; Models; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Statistical methods; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; Soft computing; comparative study; numerical method; analytical method; Precipitation (meteorology); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Knowledge based systems; time series; Errors; precipitation assessment; estimation method; precipitation (climatology); Mean square error; Root mean square errors; Precipitation (chemical); Determination coefficients; Gene expression; Gene expression programming; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Genes; Precipitation process; Soft computing methods; Time series modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a hydrological ensemble flood forecasting system comprised of an automatically calibrated Variable Infiltration Capacity model and quantitative precipitation forecasts from TIGGE dataset is constructed for Lanjiang Basin, Southeast China. The impacts of calibration strategies and ensemble methods on the performance of the system are then evaluated. The hydrological model is optimized by the parallel programmed ε-NSGA II multi-objective algorithm. According to the solutions by ε-NSGA II, two differently parameterized models are determined to simulate daily flows and peak flows at each of the three hydrological stations. Then a simple yet effective modular approach is proposed to combine these daily and peak flows at the same station into one composite series. Five ensemble methods and various evaluation metrics are adopted. The results show that ε-NSGA II can provide an objective determination on parameter estimation, and the parallel program permits a more efficient simulation. It is also demonstrated that the forecasts from ECMWF have more favorable skill scores than other Ensemble Prediction Systems. The multimodel ensembles have advantages over all the single model ensembles and the multimodel methods weighted on members and skill scores outperform other methods. Furthermore, the overall performance at three stations can be satisfactory up to ten days, however the hydrological errors can degrade the skill score by approximately 2 days, and the influence persists until a lead time of 10 days with a weakening trend. With respect to peak flows selected by the Peaks Over Threshold approach, the ensemble means from single models or multimodels are generally underestimated, indicating that the ensemble mean can bring overall improvement in forecasting of flows.

This new semi-analytical solution was verified against a numerical solution, as well as the peak location trajectory obtained using the Predictor-Corrector method. Sensitivity analyses of tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient using the proposed solution were performed to understand plume behavior with regard to plume shape, plume spatial moments, and macrodispersion coefficients to gain a better understanding of the transport mechanisms. As the tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient were increased, the peaks were travelled faster, and peak concentrations were decreased. In addition, an increase in tidal amplitude, hydraulic conductivity, and storage coefficient caused an increase in variance as well as the macrodispersion coefficient. It was observed that negative macrodispersion appeared when the storage coefficient was largest, as well as when the difference between landward-directed advective velocity at the leading and trailing edges of the plume was greatest.

Nevertheless, the statistical foundation of these indices assumes stationarity for certain aspects of the climatic variables, which could no longer be valid under climate change. This contribution provides a framework to analyze the impact of climate change on meteorological and hydrological droughts, considering shifts in precipitation and temperature, adapted to a Mediterranean basin. For this purpose, droughts are characterized through a combination of relative standardized indices: Standardized Precipitation Index (rSPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (rSPEI) and a Standardized Flow Index (rSFI). The uncertainty and the stationarity of the distribution parameters used to compute the drought indices are assessed by bootstrapping resampling techniques and overlapping coefficients. For the application of the approach to a semiarid Mediterranean basin (Jucar River Basin), the Thornthwaite scheme was modified to improve the representation of the intra-annual variation of the potential evapotranspiration and low flow simulation in hydrological modelling was improved for a better characterization of hydrological droughts. Results for the Jucar basin show a general increase in the intensity and magnitude of both meteorological and hydrological droughts under climate change scenarios, due to the combined effects of rainfall reduction and evapotranspiration increase. Although the indicators show similar values for the historical period, under climate change scenarios the rSPI could underestimate the severity of meteorological droughts by ignoring the role of temperature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:18","2018-01-19 23:10:18","","292-305","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change scenarios; Evapotranspiration; drought; potential evapotranspiration; rainfall; temperature; Standardized precipitation index; Meteorological drought; Spain; Mediterranean Sea; Drought indices; climate change; Drought; bootstrapping; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; standardization; Climate change impact; precipitation (climatology); climate effect; hydrometeorology; annual variation; Mediterranean Region; Potential evapotranspiration; index method; Atmospheric temperature; Hydrological droughts; Distribution parameters; Jucar Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a modeling chain framework to project future hydrological changes and the associated uncertainties in the Xijiang River basin, South China, was established. The framework consists of three emission scenarios (ESs), four climate models (CMs), four statistical downscaling (SD) methods, four hydrological modeling (HM) schemes, and four probability distributions (PDs) for extreme flow frequency analyses. Direct variance method was adopted to analyze the manner by which uncertainty sources such as ES, CM, SD, and HM affect the estimates of future evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow, and to quantify the uncertainties of PDs in future flood and drought risk assessment. Results show that ES is one of the least important uncertainty sources in most situations. CM, in general, is the dominant uncertainty source for the projections of monthly ET and monthly streamflow during most of the annual cycle, daily streamflow below the 99.6% quantile level, and extreme low flow. SD is the most predominant uncertainty source in the projections of extreme high flow, and has a considerable percentage of uncertainty contribution in monthly streamflow projections in July–September. The effects of SD in other cases are negligible. HM is a non-ignorable uncertainty source that has the potential to produce much larger uncertainties for the projections of low flow and ET in warm and wet seasons than for the projections of high flow. PD contributes a larger percentage of uncertainty in extreme flood projections than it does in extreme low flow estimates. Despite the large uncertainties in hydrological projections, this work found that future extreme low flow would undergo a considerable reduction, and a noticeable increase in drought risk in the Xijiang River basin would be expected.

However, a considerable part of rainfall data to be used in the hydrological practice is available in aggregated form within constant time intervals. This can produce undesirable effects, like the underestimation of the annual maximum rainfall depth, Hd, associated with a given duration, d, that is the basic quantity in the development of rainfall depth-duration-frequency relationships. The errors in the evaluation of Hd from data characterized by a coarse temporal aggregation, ta, and a procedure to reduce the non-homogeneity of the Hd series are here investigated. Our results show that for ta = 1 min the underestimation is practically negligible, whereas for larger temporal aggregations with d = ta the error in a single Hd can reach values up to 50% and in a series of Hd in the average up to 17%. Relationships between the non-dimensional ratio ta/d and the average underestimation of Hd, derived through continuous rainfall data observed in many stations of Central Italy, are presented to overcome this issue. These equations allow to improve the Hd estimates and the associated depth-duration-frequency curves at least in areas with similar climatic conditions.

The novel solution method applies the Laplace transform in combination with the generalized integral transform technique (GITT) to obtain the generalized analytical solution. Based on this generalized analytical expression, we derive a comprehensive set of special-case solutions for some time-dependent boundary distributions and zero-order productions, described by the Dirac delta, constant, Heaviside, exponentially-decaying, or periodically sinusoidal functions as well as some position-dependent initial conditions and zero-order productions specified by the Dirac delta, constant, Heaviside, or exponentially-decaying functions. The developed solutions are tested against an analytical solution from the literature. The excellent agreement between the analytical solutions confirms that the new model can serve as an effective tool for investigating transport behaviors under different scenarios. Several examples of applications, are given to explore transport behaviors which are rarely noted in the literature. The results show that the concentration waves resulting from the periodically sinusoidal input are sensitive to dispersion coefficient. The implication of this new finding is that a tracer test with a periodic input may provide additional information when for identifying the dispersion coefficients.

The simulated rainfall of 120 mm h−1 lasted for 45 min. Among the five hydraulic factors (i.e., flow velocity, runoff depth, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power), flow velocity and stream power showed close relationships with SOC concentration, especially the average flow velocity at 2 m from the outlet where the runoff attained the maximum sediment load. Flow velocity controlled SOC enrichment by affecting the suspension–saltation transport associated with the clay and silt contents in sediments. In consideration of runoff rate, average flow velocity at 2 m location from the outlet, and slope steepness as input variables, a hydraulic-based sediment and SOC loss model was built on the basis of the relationships of hydraulic factors to sediment and SOC loss. Nonlinear regression models were built to calculate the parameters of the model. The difference between the effective and dispersed median diameter (δD50) or the SOC content of the original soil served as the independent variable. The hydraulic-based sediment and SOC loss model exhibited good performance for the Suide and Changwu soils, that is, these soils contained lower amounts of aggregates than those of Ansai and Yangling soils. The hydraulic-based empirical model for sediment and SOC loss can serve as an important reference for physical-based sediment models and can bring new insights into SOC loss prediction when serious erosion occurs on steep slopes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:42","2018-01-19 23:10:42","","600-612","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Regression analysis; Runoff; rainfall-runoff modeling; regression analysis; Models; parameterization; Sediments; concentration (composition); Erosion; experimental study; empirical analysis; Storms; Independent variables; Soils; extreme event; Landforms; complexity; soil erosion; organic carbon; Organic carbon; soil carbon; Flow velocity; Soil organic carbon; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi; rainstorm; Shear stress; Suspended sediments; Velocity; flow velocity; Shear flow; Suspensions (fluids); Soil erosion; Nonlinear regression models; Chinese Loess Plateau; Gravitational erosions; Hydraulic factors; Silt; Simulated rainfall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, daily streamflow data of bi-basin low flows were sampled at window sizes from 3 to183 days by using the annual minimum method. The stationarity of low flows was tested by a change point analysis and non-stationary low flows were reconstructed by using the moving mean method. Three bivariate Archimedean copulas and five common univariate distributions were applied to fit the joint and marginal distributions of bi-basin low flows. Then, by considering the window size of sampling low flows under environmental change, the change in the joint risk of interbasin water transfer was investigated. Results showed that the non-stationarity of low flows in the recipient basin at all window sizes was significant due to the regulation of water reservoirs. The general extreme value distribution was found to fit the marginal distributions of bi-basin low flows. Three Archimedean copulas satisfactorily fitted the joint distribution of bi-basin low flows and then the Frank copula was found to be the comparatively better. The moving mean method differentiated the location parameter of the GEV distribution, but did not differentiate the scale and shape parameters, and the copula parameters. Due to environmental change, in particular the regulation of water reservoirs in the recipient basin, the decrease of the joint synchronous risk of bi-basin water shortage was slight, but those of the synchronous assurance of water transfer from the donor were remarkable. With the enlargement of window size of sampling low flows, both the joint synchronous risk of bi-basin water shortage, and the joint synchronous assurance of water transfer from the donor basin when there was a water shortage in the recipient basin exhibited a decreasing trend, but their changes were with a slight fluctuation, in particular at shorter window sizes. The decreasing magnitude of individual water shortage risk in the recipient basin was significantly greater than that of joint bi-basin water shortage risk at all window sizes. Although the donor basin had much rich water, but its individual risk accounted for more than 25.3% within a window size of 30 days provided that its instream flow was maintained. In practical design and management of interbasin water transfer, impacts of the window size of sampling low flows under environmental change on the joint distribution of bi-basin low flows and the individual risk of water shortage in the donor basin should be paid more attention. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:49","2018-01-19 23:10:49","","1-11","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Statistics; basin; design; instream flow; low flow; reservoir; streamflow; probability; risk assessment; Probability distributions; Reservoirs (water); Environmental regulations; environmental change; multivariate analysis; Water transfers; Copulas; Low flow; Nonstationary; Window Size","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many methods exist ranging from classical purely statistical approaches to more complex approaches based on process simulation. The results of these methods are associated with uncertainties that are sometimes difficult to estimate due to the complexity of the approaches or the number of parameters, especially for process simulation. This is the case of the simulation-based FFA approach called SHYREG presented in this paper, in which a rainfall generator is coupled with a simple rainfall-runoff model in an attempt to estimate the uncertainties due to the estimation of the seven parameters needed to estimate flood frequencies. The six parameters of the rainfall generator are mean values, so their theoretical distribution is known and can be used to estimate the generator uncertainties. In contrast, the theoretical distribution of the single hydrological model parameter is unknown; consequently, a bootstrap method is applied to estimate the calibration uncertainties. The propagation of uncertainty from the rainfall generator to the hydrological model is also taken into account. This method is applied to 1112 basins throughout France. Uncertainties coming from the SHYREG method and from purely statistical approaches are compared, and the results are discussed according to the length of the recorded observations, basin size and basin location. Uncertainties of the SHYREG method decrease as the basin size increases or as the length of the recorded flow increases. Moreover, the results show that the confidence intervals of the SHYREG method are relatively small despite the complexity of the method and the number of parameters (seven). This is due to the stability of the parameters and takes into account the dependence of uncertainties due to the rainfall model and the hydrological calibration. Indeed, the uncertainties on the flow quantiles are on the same order of magnitude as those associated with the use of a statistical law with two parameters (here generalised extreme value Type I distribution) and clearly lower than those associated with the use of a three-parameter law (here generalised extreme value Type II distribution). For extreme flood quantiles, the uncertainties are mostly due to the rainfall generator because of the progressive saturation of the hydrological model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:10:56","2018-01-19 23:10:56","","360-369","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Rain; rainfall; simulation; Uncertainty; Flood frequency analysis; Risk management; Bootstrap; Statistical methods; bootstrapping; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; calibration; France; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Hydrology; Rainfall-runoff modeling; stochasticity; complexity; estimation method; hazard assessment; flood frequency; Frequency estimation; Propagation of uncertainties; Calibration uncertainty; Flood frequency estimation; Flood hazards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, no practical approach has been proposed to produce realistic binary images of fractured rocks from micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images for fluid flow simulation. In this paper, a novel method is developed for generating a binary image that contains the true characteristics of fractured rocks for accurate computation of permeability. The method employs high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) data for calibration of micro-CT images. Micro-CT is used to obtain 3D images of a highly fractured rock sample with a resolution of 16.5μm and SEM is applied to obtain images with nanometer resolution from polished surfaces of the sample. The SEM images are then registered to the micro-CT images to facilitate image segmentation and generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve correlates the grayscale values at the midpoint of each fracture to the true aperture size measured from SEM data. Thinned fractures of two subsets are extracted and used to obtain the gray-scale values at the midpoint of fractures. These are converted to the true aperture value using the calibration curve and subsequently grown by an adjustment algorithm to produce 3D calibrated binary images that are representative of the true fracture system. The connectivity and aperture size distribution of the subsets before and after calibration are quantified. The permeability of the subsets before and after calibration are computed using a direct numerical simulator and compared with experimental measurements. The computed permeabilities demonstrate that using non-calibrated images generates massive permeability errors whereas calibrated images produce accurate permeability results that nearly coincide with experimental measurments. The method can be applied to fractured rocks for better prediction of permeability and other petrophysical properties. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:01","2018-01-19 23:11:01","","817-826","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; algorithm; prediction; calibration; accuracy assessment; Flow of fluids; image analysis; fluid flow; digital mapping; imaging method; Bins; tomography; permeability; Fracture; Rocks; Mechanical permeability; Computerized tomography; fracture flow; fracture aperture; fractured medium; Accurate computations; Binary images; Fracture apertures; Fractured media; High-resolution scanning electron microscopes; Image segmentation; Micro computed tomography (micro-CT); Micro CT; Nanometer resolutions; Petrophysical properties; rock; Scanning electron microscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several modeling tools and many laboratory methods already exist in the literature to determine the hydraulic properties of soils, the importance of an accurate materials hydraulic description of the permeable pavement system, is increasingly recognized in the fields of urban hydrology. Thus, the aim of this study is to propose techniques/procedures on how to interpret water flow through the construction system using the HYDRUS model. The overall analysis includes experimental and mathematical procedures for model calibration and validation to assess the suitability of the HYDRUS-2D model to interpret the hydraulic behaviour of a lab-scale permeable pavement system. The system consists of three porous materials: a wear layer of porous concrete blocks, a bedding layers of fine gravel, and a sub-base layer of coarse gravel. The water regime in this system, i.e. outflow at the bottom and water contents in the middle of the bedding layer, was monitored during ten irrigation events of various durations and intensities. The hydraulic properties of porous concrete blocks and fine gravel described by the van Genuchten functions were measured using the clay tank and the multistep outflow experiments, respectively. Coarse gravel properties were set at literature values. In addition, some of the parameters (Ks of the concrete blocks layer, and α n and Ks of the bedding layer) were optimized with the HYDRUS-2D model from water fluxes and soil water contents measured during irrigation events. The measured and modeled hydrographs were compared using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index (varied between 0.95 and 0.99) while the coefficient of determination R2 was used to assess the measured water content versus the modelled water content in the bedding layer (R2=0.81÷0.87). The parameters were validated using the remaining sets of measurements resulting in NSE values greater than 0.90 (0.91÷0.99) and R2 between 0.63 and 0.91.

As aridity is a reliable indicator of potential available water, assessment of its changes under future climatic conditions is important for proper management of water. This study employs the UNESCO aridity/humidity index, which is a derivative of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET), for assessment of aridity. Historical (1901–2005) simulations and future (2006–2100) projections of 22 global climate models (GCMs) from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are studied. The Nested Bias Correction (NBC) approach is used to correct possible biases of precipitation (simulated directly by the GCMs) and PET (estimated by applying FAO56-Penman-Monteith model on simulated parameters of the GCMs). To detect future aridity changes, the areal extents of the aridity zones in the past and future periods as well as through four sub-periods (2006–2025, 2026–2050, 2051–2075, and 2076–2100) of the future are compared. The results indicate that changes in climate will alter the areal extents of aridity zones in the future. In general, from the first sub-period towards the last one, the area covered by hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid zones will increase (by 7.46%, 7.01%, 5.80%, and 2.78%, respectively), while the area of the humid regions will decrease (by 4.76%), suggesting that there will be less water over the global land area in the future. To understand the cause of these changes, precipitation and PET are also separately assumed to be stationary throughout the four future sub-periods and the resulting aridity changes are then analyzed. The results reveal that the aridity changes are mostly caused by the positive PET trends, even though the slight precipitation increase lessens the magnitude of the changes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:15","2018-01-19 23:11:15","","451-469","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","CMIP5; Climate change; Water management; potential evapotranspiration; water availability; Aridity; Global climate model; climate change; water management; Climate models; global climate; precipitation (climatology); Bias correction; correction; Potential evapotranspiration; index method; CMIP; climate conditions; Global climate changes; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; aridity; Hydroclimatic conditions; UNESCO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is a hybrid methodology of interval parameter programming (IPP), fuzzy programing (FP), and a general one-dimensional water quality model. The method extends on the traditional interval parameter fuzzy programming method by integrating water quality model into the optimization framework.

Besides, unlike many of the past studies about water resource management, population as a significant factor has been considered.

This approach integrates a non-stationary probability distribution function into cost-benefit analysis, and influence of non-stationarity on expected total cost (including flood damage and construction costs) and design flood estimation can be quantified. To facilitate design flood selections, a ‘Risk-Cost’ analysis approach is developed, which reveals the nexus of extreme flood risk, expected total cost and design life periods. Two basins, with 54-year and 104-year flood data respectively, are utilized to illustrate the application. It is found that the developed approach can effectively reveal changes of expected total cost and extreme floods in different design life periods. In addition, trade-offs are found between extreme flood risk and expected total cost, which reflect increases in cost to mitigate risk. Comparing with stationary approaches which generate only one expected total cost curve and therefore only one design flood estimation, the proposed new approach generate design flood estimation intervals and the ‘Risk-Cost’ approach selects a design flood value from the intervals based on the trade-offs between extreme flood risk and expected total cost. This study provides a new approach towards a better understanding of the influence of non-stationarity on expected total cost and design floods, and could be beneficial to cost-benefit based non-stationary design flood estimation across the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:28","2018-01-19 23:11:28","","128-136","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; risk; Non-stationarities; trade-off; Risk perception; probability; Floods; Economic and social effects; Distribution functions; Probability distributions; extreme event; estimation method; Costs; Risks; Commerce; flood frequency; Cost benefit analysis; Flood frequency; Cost estimating; cost-benefit analysis; design flood; Cost engineering; Cost benefits; Design life; Nexus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While flood control should take part early on urban planning, not enough is known to guide such plans and provide incentive to land use decisions that minimize the vulnerability to localized floods. In this paper, we offer a broader perspective on flood protection, by treating the original hydrologic flow regulation as an environmental service, and exploring how the value of this environmental service drives economic land use decisions that convert original (permeable) land into urbanized (impermeable). We investigate the relationship between land use decisions and their hydrologic consequences explicitly, and use this relationship to simulate resulting land use scenarios depending on the value attached to the environmental service of flow regulation. Rainfall-runoff simulation model results are combined to an optimization model based on two-stage stochastic programming approach to model economic land use decisions. The objective function maximizes the total expected land use benefit in an urban area, considering the opportunity cost of permeable areas in the first stage and the resulting loss of the environmental service of flow regulation on the second stage, under several probable hydrological events. A watershed in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, is used to demonstrate the approach. Different values attached to the environmental service were tested, from zero to higher than the opportunity cost of land, and artificial detention infrastructure was included to calculate the resulting land use change and the loss in the environmental service value. Results indicate that by valuing the environmental service loss and discounting it from the economic benefits of land use, alternative solutions to land use are found, with decreased peak flows and lower flood frequency. Combined solutions including structural and non-structural techniques provide more cost effective results, avoiding both the depletion of the environmental service and the high opportunity cost associated to valuable commercial urban areas. Urban development under such premises will be more resilient and adapted to local flooding, instead of relying on increasingly expensive infrastructure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:33","2018-01-19 23:11:33","","406-419","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; rainfall-runoff modeling; Stochastic programming; Optimization; Floods; Flood control; Land use; vulnerability; watershed; Economics; Watersheds; flood control; drainage network; urban drainage; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Brazil; Cost effectiveness; stochasticity; ecosystem service; Objective functions; land use change; urban planning; Urban planning; Urban floods; Costs; Optimization modeling; Urban growth; Hydrological events; peak flow; flood frequency; Environmental regulations; flow regulation; Alternative solutions; Belo Horizonte; Environmental services; incentive; Minas Gerais; Rainfall-runoff simulations; Two-stage stochastic programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study presents an updated groundwater δ18O isoscape for the Republic of Ireland and describes the climatic and geological drivers influencing 18O composition. In all, 142 geographically and geologically representative groundwater installations were sampled and analysed, in addition to 35 samples from six nested boreholes. Geospatially, Irish groundwater exhibits high δ18O values in southern and western coastal regions, becoming progressively depleted inland before reaching lowest measured values along the eastern coast, equating to a national groundwater δ18O profile range of approximately 3‰. Groundwater δ18O composition is primarily driven by location with respect to orographically influenced rainfall deposition and annual precipitation volume, with a bias towards winter recharge. Results also demonstrate that local/regional (hydro)geological setting exerts a secondary influence on δ18O composition via infiltration and recharge mechanisms. “Flashy” groundwater systems (e.g. karst limestones) are more likely to exhibit seasonal groundwater δ18O patterns, whereas low productivity systems with high residence times (e.g. granites), tend to display a dampened composition to groundwater recharge and exhibit more temporally constant δ18O values. The derived δ18O isoscape enhances current understanding of what is a geologically distinct groundwater setting, whilst also potentially serving as a δ18O “sentinel” for continental Europe, with respect to both groundwater and precipitation, due to Ireland's geographic location. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:11:39","2018-01-19 23:11:39","","173-186","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; Climate; hydrochemistry; Groundwater; spatiotemporal analysis; infiltration; Ireland; chemical composition; Precipitation (meteorology); coastal zone; climate effect; Ground water recharge; recharge; Isotopes; stable isotope; Recharging (underground waters); Geology; Annual precipitation; oxygen isotope; precipitation (chemistry); Recharge; Natural environments; Residence time distribution; borehole; Isoscape; Mechanisms; Secondary influences; Stable isotopes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even so, under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 36.8% and 71.1% of the tributaries of the Yellow River basin are dominated by increasing streamflow.

The experiments were performed under slope gradients of 5° 10° 15° and 20°; flow discharge rates of 1, 2, 4, and 8 L/min; and stone contents of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 50% on mass basis. Nine equidistant sensors were used to measure flow velocity along flume from the top of the slope. Results indicated that stone content significantly affected flow velocity under increasing slope gradient. The increase in stone content rapidly reduced the flow velocity. The flow velocities over frozen slopes were 1.21 to 1.30 times of those over non-frozen slopes under different slope gradients and flow rates. When the stone content increased from 0% to 20%, proportions gradually decreased from 52% to 25% and 13%.

It is often the case that mega cities are located along downstream reaches of a large river basin in many areas of all over the world, and their extreme flood frequencies are assumed to be highly affected by dam operation and river overflow of its upstream areas. In particular, when upstream areas are also protected by river dike system, historical discharge samples cannot represent the impact of upstream river overflow on downstream extreme flood frequencies because it rarely occurs. FFA without this consideration, especially in large river basins which include several potential floodplains, would lead to inappropriate assessment of flood risk. To deal with this issue, FFA needs to incorporate flood-inundation modelling of upstream areas; however, previous studies on FFA have focused on smaller watersheds and combined rainfall-runoff models. Therefore, this study examined the impact of river overflow and dam operation of upstream areas on downstream extreme flood frequencies through a case study of the Yodo River basin (7280 km2). To achieve FFA in a large river basin, this study combined a flood-inundation model of upstream Kyoto City area to a rainfall-based flood frequency model (RFFM) which accounts for the probability of spatial and temporal rainfall pattern over the river basin in a practical manner. The RFFM was validated with reproduced discharge samples of historical storm events and then applied to extreme flood frequency estimation. The application clarified that upstream river overflow causes much more drastic change of downstream flood frequencies beyond the design level than dam operation, which indicates that FFA for flood risk assessment needs to consider river overflow of its upstream areas otherwise flood risk of downstream areas will be overestimated. Furthermore, the scheme also produced the cumulative distribution function of flood area, which represents flood risk of upstream areas. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:12:03","2018-01-19 23:12:03","","370-382","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Risk assessment; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; Flood frequency analysis; probability; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; risk assessment; Watersheds; Distribution functions; river basin; Rainfall-runoff models; environmental impact assessment; Flood risks; frequency analysis; Risks; Hydraulic structures; flood frequency; Frequency estimation; Japan; Flood inundation modeling; Extreme flood; Cumulative distribution function; Flood inundation modelling; Honshu; Kinki; Kyoto [Kinki]; megacity; Upstream river overflow; Yodo Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In respect of climate change, precipitation alters not only in magnitude, but also in intensity, which can be represented by precipitation depth. To further understand the spatial variation of the impact of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, precipitation depth and the water storage capacity during 1960–2010, 224 catchments located from arid areas to humid areas across China were analyzed in this paper based on the Choudhury-Porporato equation within the Budyko hypothesis. The results show that underlying surface change is the major driving force of runoff change in the Songhua Basin, the Liaohe Basin and the Haihe Basin, while climate change dominates runoff change in other basins. Climate change causes runoff increase in most catchments, except for some catchments in the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin. Specifically, changes in precipitation depth induce runoff increase in almost each catchment and show a considerable contribution rate (14.8% on average, larger than 20% in 32% catchments). The contribution of precipitation depth change has little correlation with the aridity index, while positively correlates to the significance of trend in precipitation depth. This study suggests that precipitation depth is an important aspect that should be taken into consideration in attribution of runoff change.

For validation, applications were performed using WT and precipitation data from two locations with contrasting properties.

Computer based soil erosion and landscape evolution models (LEMs) offer the potential to be reliable assessment and prediction tools. An advantage of such models is that they provide both erosion and deposition patterns as well as total catchment sediment output. However, before use, like all models they require calibration and validation. In recent years LEMs have been used for a variety of both natural and disturbed landscape assessment. However, these models have not been evaluated for their reliability in steep forested catchments. Here, the SIBERIA LEM is calibrated and evaluated for its reliability for two steep forested catchments in south-eastern Australia. The model is independently calibrated using two methods. Firstly, hydrology and sediment transport parameters are inferred from catchment geomorphology and soil properties and secondly from catchment sediment transport and discharge data. The results demonstrate that both calibration methods provide similar parameters and reliable modelled sediment transport output. A sensitivity study of the input parameters demonstrates the model's sensitivity to correct parameterisation and also how the model could be used to assess potential timber harvesting as well as the removal of vegetation by fire. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:12:30","2018-01-19 23:12:30","","12-23","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Calibration; Runoff; catchment; hydrology; prediction; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; calibration; model validation; Catchments; Erosion; Forestry; Hydrology; Soils; geomorphology; Calibration and validations; soil erosion; sedimentation; bedload; headwater; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; South-eastern Australia; Bed load; Erosion and deposition; Forest hydrologies; Landscape assessments; landscape evolution; Landscape evolutions; Logging (forestry); SIBERIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper first establishes a semi-analytical model of an MFH well with SRV including the QGT. Introducing the transformed pressure and flow-rate function, the nonlinear model of a point source in a composite system including the QGT is linearized. Then the Laplace transform, principle of superposition, numerical discrete method, Gaussian elimination method and Stehfest numerical inversion are employed to establish and solve the seepage model of the MFH well with SRV. Type curves are plotted and the effects of relevant parameters are analyzed. It is found that the nonlinear effect caused by the QGT can increase the flow capacity of fluid flow and influence the transient pressure positively. The relevant parameters not only have an effect on the type curve but also affect the error in the pressure calculated by the conventional linear model.

This includes the key issue of post-dam river channel erosion, which was predicted by the feasibility study to extend to the river mouth. In this paper we examine the geomorphic response of the channel of the middle Yangtze for 660 km downstream of the dam. Using data on channel characteristics, bed material and sediment transport, we show that in the decade following the dam closure, pre-dam seasonal erosion has been replaced by year-round erosion, a pattern most marked at the upstream end of the study area. The sediment carrying capacity of the river channel has been largely reduced below the dam. The locus of bed scour has moved progressively downstream, ceasing as the bed material became too coarse to be transported (e.g. D50: 0.29 mm pre-dam coarsened to 20 mm below the dam by 2008). About 400 km below the dam there is a reduction in channel slope that changes the sediment carrying capacity from 0.25 kg m−3 to only about 0.05 kg m−3, which is insufficient to move bed sediment. The new long-term hydro-morphological equilibrium that will be established in this section of the middle Yangtze will prevent the further incision downstream initiated by the Three Gorges Dam.

However, many catchments around the world are ungauged and estimating runoff for these catchments is challenging. One approach is to perform a few runoff measurements in a previously fully ungauged catchment and to constrain a runoff model by these measurements. In this study we investigated the value of such individual runoff measurements when taken at strategic points in time for applying a bucket-type runoff model (HBV) in ungauged catchments. Based on the assumption that a limited number of runoff measurements can be taken, we sought the optimal sampling strategy (i.e. when to measure the streamflow) to obtain the most informative data for constraining the runoff model. We used twenty gauged catchments across the eastern US, made the assumption that these catchments were ungauged, and applied different runoff sampling strategies. All tested strategies consisted of twelve runoff measurements within one year and ranged from simply using monthly flow maxima to a more complex selection of observation times. In each case the twelve runoff measurements were used to select 100 best parameter sets using a Monte Carlo calibration approach. Runoff simulations using these ‘informed’ parameter sets were then evaluated for an independent validation period in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of the hydrograph and the mean absolute relative error of the flow-duration curve. Model performance measures were normalized by relating them to an upper and a lower benchmark representing a well-informed and an uninformed model calibration. The hydrographs were best simulated with strategies including high runoff magnitudes as opposed to the flow-duration curves that were generally better estimated with strategies that captured low and mean flows. The choice of a sampling strategy covering the full range of runoff magnitudes enabled hydrograph and flow-duration curve simulations close to a well-informed model calibration.

In this study, the role of heterogeneity patterns was explored using the fully integrated hydrological model HydroGeoSphere simulating complex, variably saturated subsurface flow. A synthetic 3-D river-aquifer reference model was constructed with a heterogeneous riverbed using non-multi-Gaussian patterns in the form of meandering channels. Data assimilation was used to test the ability of different riverbed K patterns to reproduce hydraulic heads, riverbed K and river-aquifer exchange fluxes. Both fully saturated as well as variably saturated conditions underneath the riverbed were tested. The data assimilation experiments with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) were carried out for four types of geostatistical models of riverbed K fields: (i) spatially homogeneous, (ii) heterogeneous with multi-Gaussian distribution, (iii) heterogeneous with non-multi-Gaussian distribution (channelized structures) and (iv) heterogeneous with non-multi-Gaussian distribution (elliptic structures). For all data assimilation experiments, state variables and riverbed K were updated by assimilating hydraulic heads. For saturated conditions, heterogeneous geostatistical models allowed a better characterization of net exchange fluxes than a homogeneous approximation. Among the three heterogeneous models, the performance of non-multi-Gaussian models was superior to the performance of the multi-Gaussian model, but the two tested non-multi-Gaussian models showed only small differences in performance from one another. For the variably saturated conditions both the multi-Gaussian model and the homogeneous model performed clearly worse than the two non-multi-Gaussian models. The two non-multi-Gaussian models did not show much difference in performance. This clearly shows that characterizing heterogeneity of riverbed K is important. Moreover, particularly under variably saturated flow conditions the mean and the variance of riverbed K do not provide enough information for exchange flux characterization and additional histogram information of riverbed K provides crucial information for the reproduction of exchange fluxes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:00","2018-01-19 23:13:00","","383-396","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","prediction; river; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Rivers; Hydrogeosphere; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; Data assimilation; aquifer; Aquifers; three-dimensional modeling; Kalman filter; river bed; geostatistics; Gaussian method; flow modeling; subsurface flow; ensemble forecasting; hydraulic conductivity; Physically based; Gaussian distribution; pattern recognition; flux measurement; hydrological regime; Kalman filters; water exchange; Characterization; Patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes an ES–based IWRM framework within which a participatory Bayesian network (BN) model is developed to assist with the coupling between ES and IWRM. The framework includes three steps: identifying water-related services of ecosystems; analysis of the tradeoff and synergy among users of water; and ES-based IWRM implementation using the participatory BN model. We present the development, evaluation and application of the participatory BN model with the involvement of four participant groups (stakeholders, water manager, water management experts, and research team) in Qira oasis area, Northwest China. As a typical catchment-scale region, the Qira oasis area is facing severe water competition between the demands of human activities and natural ecosystems. Results demonstrate that the BN model developed provides effective integration of ES into a quantitative IWMR framework via public negotiation and feedback. The network results, sensitivity evaluation, and management scenarios are broadly accepted by the participant groups. The intervention scenarios from the model conclude that any water management measure remains unable to sustain the ecosystem health in water-related ES. Greater cooperation among the stakeholders is highly necessary for dealing with such water conflicts. In particular, a proportion of the agricultural water saved through improving water-use efficiency should be transferred to natural ecosystems via water trade. The BN model developed is appropriate for areas throughout the world in which there is intense competition for water between human activities and ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:07","2018-01-19 23:13:07","","50-65","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water management; Water resources; water management; trade-off; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; Ecology; water resource; Ecosystem services; Ecosystems; Participatory modelling; stakeholder; participatory approach; Water supply; Human resource management; ecosystem health; human activity; ecosystem service; Stakeholders; water use efficiency; Research and development management; Integrated water resource management; Integrated Water Resources Management; IWRM; Management scenarios; oasis; Sensitivity evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also considered one of the major factors affecting groundwater recharge. Uncertainties and inconsistencies in LULC maps are one of the difficulties that LULC timeseries analysis face and which have a significant effect on hydrological impact analysis. Therefore, an accuracy assessment approach of LULC timeseries is needed for a more reliable hydrological analysis and prediction. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of land use uncertainty and to improve the accuracy of a timeseries of CORINE (coordination of information on the environment) land cover maps by using a new approach of identifying spatial–temporal LULC change trajectories as a pre-processing tool. This ensures consistency of model input when dealing with land-use dynamics and as such improves the accuracy of land use maps and consequently groundwater recharge estimation. As a case study the impact of consistent land use changes from 1990 until 2013 on groundwater recharge for the Flanders-Brussels region is assessed. The change trajectory analysis successfully assigned a rational trajectory to 99% of all pixels. The methodology is shown to be powerful in correcting interpretation inconsistencies and overestimation errors in CORINE land cover maps. The overall kappa (cell-by-cell map comparison) improved from 0.6 to 0.8 and from 0.2 to 0.7 for forest and pasture land use classes respectively. The study shows that the inconsistencies in the land use maps introduce uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimation in a range of 10–30%. The analysis showed that during the period of 1990–2013 the LULC changes were mainly driven by urban expansion. The results show that the resolution at which the spatial analysis is performed is important; the recharge differences using original and corrected CORINE land cover maps increase considerably with increasing spatial resolution. This study indicates that improving consistency of land use map timeseries is of critical importance for assessing land use change and its environmental impact. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:14","2018-01-19 23:13:14","","558-569","","","554","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; urbanization; land cover; Uncertainty analysis; Trajectory analysis; anthropogenic effect; Groundwater; Land use; spatiotemporal analysis; Environmental impact; uncertainty analysis; accuracy assessment; Trajectories; Forestry; land use change; Belgium; Ground water recharge; recharge; Land use and land cover; Recharging (underground waters); Hydrological analysis; Hydrological impacts; Brussels [Belgium]; Global environmental change; Land use/land cover; Flanders; LULC; social impact assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyses were conducted in this study to examine the influence of various representations of snow cover and melt energy heterogeneity on both simulated SCD and stream discharge from a small alpine basin in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Simulations were performed using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM), where point-scale snowmelt computations were made using a snowpack energy balance formulation and applied to spatial frequency distributions of snow water equivalent (SWE) on individual slope-, aspect-, and landcover-based hydrological response units (HRUs) in the basin. Hydrological routines were added to represent the vertical and lateral transfers of water through the basin and channel system. From previous studies it is understood that the heterogeneity of late winter SWE is a primary control on patterns of SCD. The analyses here showed that spatial variation in applied melt energy, mainly due to differences in net radiation, has an important influence on SCD at multiple scales and basin discharge, and cannot be neglected without serious error in the prediction of these variables. A single basin SWE distribution using the basin-wide mean SWE (SWE‾) and coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean) was found to represent the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of SWE sufficiently well. Simulations that accounted for differences in (SWE‾) among HRUs but neglected the sub-HRU heterogeneity of SWE were found to yield similar discharge results as simulations that included this heterogeneity, while SCD was poorly represented, even at the basin level. Finally, applying point-scale snowmelt computations based on a single SWE depth for each HRU (thereby neglecting spatial differences in internal snowpack energetics over the distributions) was found to yield similar SCD and discharge results as simulations that resolved internal energy differences. Spatial/internal snowpack melt energy effects are more pronounced at times earlier in spring before the main period of snowmelt and SCD, as shown in previously published work. The paper discusses the importance of these findings as they apply to the warranted complexity of snowmelt process simulation in cold mountain environments, and shows how the end-of-winter SWE distribution represents an effective means of resolving snow cover heterogeneity at multiple scales for modelling, even in steep and complex terrain. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:19","2018-01-19 23:13:19","","199-213","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Snow; simulation; snowpack; Models; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; runoff; Spatial distribution; Canada; Hydrology; Large scale hydrological model; Landforms; Rocky Mountains; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Snowmelt; snow cover; mountain environment; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; Coefficient of variation; glacial hydrology; Cold regions hydrological model; Hydrological response unit; Mountain; Snow covers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four different layering configurations were investigated, including a homogeneous case (case H), and three different layered cases where a low permeability layer was set at the top of the aquifer (case LH), at the middle part of the aquifer as interlayer (case HLH), and at the lower part of the aquifer (case HL). The subsurface dam was able to retain the saltwater wedge associated with a drop of the hydraulic gradient from 0.0158 down to 0.0095 in all the cases, thereby achieving up to 78% reduction in the saltwater toe length. In cases LH and HLH, the start of the saltwater spillage was delayed compared to the homogeneous case, and the time taken for the freshwater zone to be fully contaminated (post-spillage) was twice and three times longer, respectively. By contrast, the existence of a low K layer at the bottom of the aquifer (case HL) considerably weakened the ability of dams to retain the intrusion, allowing for quicker saltwater spillage past the wall. The natural cleanup of SWI-contaminated coastal aquifers was, for the first time, evidenced in heterogeneous settings. Depending on the stratification pattern, the presence of stratified layers however prolonged the cleanup time to various degrees, compared to the homogeneous scenario, particularly in case HL, where the cleanup time was nearly 50% longer. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:25","2018-01-19 23:13:25","","708-721","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Dams; software; Hydrogeology; heterogeneity; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater pollution; Mercury (metal); Salt water intrusion; Seawater; laboratory method; Groundwater geochemistry; Laboratory experiments; dam; coastal aquifer; Subsurface heterogeneity; seawater; Aquifer remediation; cleanup; Coastal aquifer managements; Physical barriers; remediation; SEAWAT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These groundwater-fed lakes are important indicators of environmental change, in part because their shallow water levels and salinity are very sensitive to weather and climatic variability. Some of this sensitivity arises from high rates of open-water evaporation, which is a dominant but poorly quantified process for saline lakes. This study used the Bowen ratio energy budget method to calculate open-water evaporation rates for Alkali Lake, a saline lake in the Nebraska Sandhills region (central United States), where numerous groundwater-fed lakes occupy the landscape. Evaporation rates were measured during the warm season (May – October) over three consecutive years (2007–2009) to gain insights into the climatic and limnological factors driving evaporation, as well as the partitioning of energy balance components at seasonal and interannual time scales. Results show a seasonal peak in evaporation rate in late June of 7.0 mm day−1 (on average), with a maximum daily rate of 10.5 mm day−1 and a 3-year mean July-September (JAS) rate of 5.1 mm day−1, which greatly exceeds the long-term JAS precipitation rate of 1.3 mm day−1. Seasonal variability in lake evaporation closely follows that of net radiation and lake surface temperature, with sensible heat flux and heat storage variations being relatively small, except in response to short-term, synoptic events. Interannual changes in the surface energy balance were weak, by comparison, although a 6-fold increase in mean lake level over the three years (0.05–0.30 m) led to greater heat storage within the lake, an enhanced JAS lake-air temperature gradient, and greater sensible heat loss. These large variations in water level were also associated with large changes in absolute salinity (from 28 to 118 g kg−1), with periods of high salinity characterized by reductions in mass transfer estimates of evaporation rate by up to 20%, depending on atmospheric conditions and absolute salinity. Energy balance estimates of evaporation, on the other hand, were found to be less sensitive to variations in salinity. These results provide regional insights for lakes in the Nebraska Sandhills region and implications for estimation of the energy and water balance of saline lakes in similar arid and semi-arid landscapes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:31","2018-01-19 23:13:31","","172-187","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Nebraska; Potential evaporation; United States; dry season; Groundwater; salinity; seasonal variation; Budget control; Water levels; Lakes; Heat flux; mass transfer; Mass transfer; shallow water; annual variation; energy balance; Energy balance; Saline water; heat flux; Energy balance components; surface temperature; saline lake; Evaporation; lake level; net radiation; sensible heat flux; surface energy; Energy and water balance; Lake surface temperature; Heat storage; Atmospheric conditions; Bowen ratio; Energy budget methods; Interannual time scale; open water; Sand Hills; Seasonal and interannual variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:38","2018-01-19 23:13:38","","262-275","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; rainfall-runoff modeling; remote sensing; Floods; two-dimensional modeling; Flood control; Hydraulic models; Agriculture; Food supply; runoff; crop production; Crops; Cultivation; Remote sensing; flood control; flood damage; Storms; food security; Remote sensing imagery; crop yield; Yield loss; Methodological frameworks; maize; Zea mays; flood; Flow velocity; Dynamics; rice; Infiltration; satellite imagery; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Glycine max; mountain region; Flood characteristics; Agricultural runoff; flow velocity; soybean; Extreme storm events; growth rate; HJ-1A/B imagery; Jilin; Two-dimensional hydraulic model; yield response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To analyse the impact of drought on maize yield loss in Northeast China in current and future climate scenarios, the Composite Meteorological Drought Index (CI) is introduced to reconstruct the following drought indicators: drought accumulative days (DAD), drought accumulative intensity (DAI), and consecutive drought days (CDD). These three drought indicators are used to describe the three-dimensional characteristics of drought in this study. Sen's slope method and three-dimensional copula functions are adopted to analyse the variety of drought features, and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used to analyse the variations in maize yield. A temporal assessment of the standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) of maize from 1961 to 2014 is conducted. A panel regression model is applied to demonstrate the drought impact on maize yield at various growth stages under the RCP4.5 scenario. The results show that the drought risk level for midwest Jilin Province, western Liaoning, and eastern Heilongjiang increase with global warming in the current scenario. The shorter three-dimensional joint return periods, 44–80 yr, were mainly located in western Jilin Province, Liaodong Peninsula, and northwestern Liaoning. Eastern Heilongjiang has a slightly longer joint return period of 80–100 yr. The SYRS shows a strong statistical correlation with drought indicator variations; drought-prone regions exhibit strong positive correlations. In comparison, excess precipitation regions show strong negative correlations with drought indicators in most growth stages. Drought indicators have a relatively strong association with SYRS at the milky–mature maize growth stage, and the occurrence of drought during this period primarily determines the maize yield changes in the future. Maize yield changes are −2.04%, −2.65% and −1.57% for Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Province under the RCP4.5 scenario. These results can be used as a tool for early warning of drought risk to maize, and will accelerate the progress of drought disaster risk management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:45","2018-01-19 23:13:45","","231-247","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Copula functions; Regression analysis; drought; Risk management; climate change; Drought; Risk perception; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; assessment method; global climate; crop yield; early warning system; Spatio-temporal variation; maize; Zea mays; climate effect; return period; Global warming; Future climate scenarios; Jilin; EEMD; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Heilongjiang; Liaodong Peninsula; Liaoning; Northeast China; SYRS; Three-dimensional characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the island of Sardinia (Italy), the decrease in runoff impacts the management of water resources, resulting in water supply restrictions even for domestic consumption. In the 10 Sardinian basins with a longer database (at least 40 complete years of data, including data from the past 10 years), runoff decreased drastically over the 1975–2010 period, with mean yearly runoff reduced by more than 40% compared to the previous 1922–1974 period. Trends in yearly runoff are negative, with Mann-Kendall τ values ranging from −0.39 to −0.2. Decreasing winter precipitation over the 1975–2010 period everywhere on Sardinia island has led to these decreases in runoff, as most yearly runoff in the Sardinian basins (70% on average) is produced by winter precipitation due to the seasonality typical of the Mediterranean climate regime. The trend in winter precipitation is not homogenous; the negative trend is higher (around −0.25) on the west Sardinian coast, becoming lower across the island toward the east coast (around −0.14). Winter precipitation is highly correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a weather phenomenon in the North Atlantic Ocean that controls the direction and strength of westerly winds and storm tracks into Europe. High negative correlations (up to −0.45) between winter NAO index and winter precipitation are estimated along the west coast. Meanwhile, these correlations decrease east across the island toward the high mountain in the center of Sardinia, reaching the lowest values along the east coast (about −0.25). The generally decreasing correlation between winter NAO index and winter precipitation in the longitudinal direction (from the North Atlantic dipole to the east) here accelerates due to local-scale orographic effects that overlap the large-scale NAO impact on the winter precipitation regime, thus softening the precipitation reduction due to the NAO. Such local topographic effects that may attenuate large-scale climate change effects must be considered in water resource planning and management alongside such climate change effects related to large-scale circulations, such as NAO. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:52","2018-01-19 23:13:52","","419-437","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Oceanography; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; Climatology; Water supply; Mediterranean basin; Sardinia; Atmospheric pressure; Topographic effects; Water resource planning; Large-scale circulation; Precipitation and runoff; North Atlantic oscillations; Longitudinal direction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, a simple tool for assessing performance of green roofs worldwide in terms of retained water is still missing and highly desirable for practical assessments. The aim of this work is to explore retention performance of green roofs as a function of their depth and in different climate regimes. Two soil depths are investigated, one representing the intensive configuration and another representing the extensive one. The role of the climate in driving water retention has been represented by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration dynamics. A simple conceptual weather generator has been implemented and used for stochastic simulation of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Stochastic forcing is used as an input of a simple conceptual hydrological model for estimating long-term water partitioning between rainfall, runoff and actual evapotranspiration. Coupling the stochastic weather generator with the conceptual hydrological model, we assessed the amount of rainfall diverted into evapotranspiration for different combinations of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in five representative climatic regimes. Results quantified the capabilities of green roofs in retaining rainfall and consequently in reducing discharges into sewer systems at an annual time scale. The role of substrate depth has been recognized to be crucial in determining green roofs retention performance, which in general increase from extensive to intensive settings. Looking at the role of climatic conditions, namely annual rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and their seasonality cycles, we found that they drive green roofs retention performance, which are the maxima when rainfall and temperature are in phase. Finally, we provide design charts for a first approximation of possible hydrological benefits deriving from the implementation of intensive or extensive green roofs in different world areas. As an example, 25 big cities have been indicated as benchmark case studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:13:58","2018-01-19 23:13:58","","763-772","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Rain; Runoff; Water quality; potential evapotranspiration; soil moisture; urbanization; seasonality; water quality; hydrological modeling; Climate models; runoff; infiltration; Storm-water managements; Storms; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Hydrology; Soil moisture; Storm sewers; Green roof; Roofs; Actual evapotranspiration; Potential evapotranspiration; Stochastic simulations; climate conditions; interception; water retention; Retention; Stochastic weather generator; Benchmark case studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, both GRACE products and model results suffer from inherent uncertainties, calling for the need to make a combined use of GRACE and models to examine the variations in total TWS and their individual components, especially in relation to natural and human-induced changes in the terrestrial water cycle. In this study, we use the results from two state-of-the-art hydrological models and different GRACE spherical harmonic products to examine the variations in TWS and its individual components, and to attribute the changes to natural and human-induced factors over large global river basins. Analysis of the spatial patterns of the long-term trend in TWS from the two models and GRACE suggests that both models capture the GRACE-measured direction of change, but differ from GRACE as well as each other in terms of the magnitude over different regions. A detailed analysis of the seasonal cycle of TWS variations over 30 river basins shows notable differences not only between models and GRACE but also among different GRACE products and between the two models. Further, it is found that while one model performs well in highly-managed river basins, it fails to reproduce the GRACE-observed signal in snow-dominated regions, and vice versa. The isolation of natural and human-induced changes in TWS in some of the managed basins reveals a consistently declining TWS trend during 2002–2010, however; significant differences are again obvious both between GRACE and models and among different GRACE products and models. Results from the decomposition of the TWS signal into the general trend and seasonality indicate that both models do not adequately capture both the trend and seasonality in the managed or snow-dominated basins implying that the TWS variations from a single model cannot be reliably used for all global regions. It is also found that the uncertainties arising from climate forcing datasets can introduce significant additional uncertainties, making direct comparison of model results and GRACE products even more difficult. Our results highlight the need to further improve the representation of human land-water management and snow processes in large-scale models to enable a reliable use of models and GRACE to study the changes in freshwater systems in all global regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:06","2018-01-19 23:14:06","","105-118","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; Water management; hydrological cycle; GRACE; Hydrological models; water management; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Climate models; anthropogenic effect; Watersheds; global perspective; Hydrology; river basin; water storage; Digital storage; terrestrial environment; Individual components; satellite mission; climate forcing; Geodetic satellites; Terrestrial water storage; long-term change; Gravity recovery and climate experiment satellites; Human impact; Comparison of models; Spherical harmonics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The criteria for the evaluation of the approach were (i) robustness and transferability of the resulting parameters, (ii) goodness-of-fit criteria in calibration and validation and (iii) time-efficiency. An order of preference was determined prior to the calibration and the parameters were separated into groups for a stepwise calibration to reduce the search space. A comparison with the global optimisation method SCE-UA showed that only 6% of the calculation time was needed; the conditions total volume, seasonality and shape of the hydrograph were successfully achieved for the calibration and for the cross-validation periods. Furthermore, the parameter sets obtained by the lexicographic calibration strategy for different time periods were much more similar to each other than the parameters obtained by SCE-UA. Besides the similarities of the parameter sets, the goodness-of-fit criteria for the cross-validation were better for the lexicographic approach and the water balance components were also more similar. Thus, we concluded that the resulting parameters were more representative for the corresponding catchments and therefore more suitable for transferability.

Historical strategies are no longer applicable under climate change. Therefore, adaptive management, especially adaptive operating rules for reservoirs, has been developed to mitigate the possible adverse effects of climate change. However, to date, adaptive operating rules are generally based on future projections involving uncertainties under climate change, yet ignoring historical information. To address this, we propose an approach for deriving adaptive operating rules considering both historical information and future projections, namely historical and future operating rules (HAFOR). A robustness index was developed by comparing benefits from HAFOR with benefits from conventional operating rules (COR). For both historical and future streamflow series, maximizations of both average benefits and the robustness index were employed as objectives, and four trade-offs were implemented to solve the multi-objective problem. Based on the integrated objective, the simulation-based optimization method was used to optimize the parameters of HAFOR. Using the Dongwushi Reservoir in China as a case study, HAFOR was demonstrated to be an effective and robust method for developing adaptive operating rules under the uncertain changing environment. Compared with historical or projected future operating rules (HOR or FPOR), HAFOR can reduce the uncertainty and increase the robustness for future projections, especially regarding results of reservoir releases and volumes. HAFOR, therefore, facilitates adaptive management in the context that climate change is difficult to predict accurately. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:19","2018-01-19 23:14:19","","691-707","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Reservoir operation; Water resources; Water resources management; optimization; reservoir; simulation; streamflow; climate change; water management; trade-off; Optimization; water resource; integrated approach; Economic and social effects; uncertainty analysis; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; adaptive management; Hydrological variables; Historical information; Changing environment; Operating rule; Multi-objective problem; Simulation-based optimizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dry conditions caused severe water shortages in one of the economically most important agricultural regions of the US. It has recently been hypothesized that anthropogenic warming is increasing the likelihood of such extreme droughts in California, or more specifically, that warmer temperatures from the enhanced greenhouse effect intensify drought conditions. However, separating the cause and effect is difficult because the dry conditions lead to a reduction in evaporative cooling that contributes to the warming. Here we investigate and compare the forcing of long-term greenhouse-induced warming with the short-term warming during the 2013–2014 Californian drought. We use the concept of radiative signatures to investigate the source of the radiative perturbation during the drought, relate the signatures to expected changes due to anthropogenic warming, and assess the cause of warming based on observed changes in the surface energy balance compared to the period 2001–2012. We found that the recent meteorological drought based on precipitation deficits was characterised by an increase in incoming shortwave radiation coupled with a decline in incoming longwave radiation, which contributed to record warm temperatures. In contrast, climate models project that anthropogenic warming is accompanied by little change in incoming shortwave but a large increase in incoming longwave radiation. The warming during the drought was associated with increased incoming shortwave radiation in combination with reduced evaporative cooling from water deficits, which enhanced surface temperatures and sensible heat transfer to the atmosphere. Our analyses demonstrate that radiative signatures are a powerful tool to differentiate the source of perturbations in the surface energy balance at monthly to seasonal time scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:14:31","2018-01-19 23:14:31","","408-418","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Meteorological drought; Drought; Climate models; Land surface; California; Energy balance; Precipitation deficits; Atmospheric temperature; Short-wave radiation; Evaporation; Interfacial energy; Heat transfer; Anthropogenic warming; Evaporative cooling systems; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouses; Radiative perturbation; Radiative signature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We applied this method to the 2008 Iowa flood in the United States and evaluated the results using the high-water mark measurements, flood extent extracted from SPOT (Small Programmable Object Technology) imagery, and the near-simultaneously acquired aerial photography. The root mean squared error of the LiDAR-derived floodwater surface profile to high-water marks was 30 cm, the consistency between the two flooded areas derived from LiDAR and SPOT imagery was 72% (81% if suspicious isolated ponds in the SPOT-derived extent were removed), and LiDAR-derived flood extent had a horizontal resolution of ∼3 m.

Our results indicate that the mean specific mass balance for the whole region is about −0.69 m w.e. yr−1 over the entire period, and about 81.3% of these glaciers experience negative net mass balance. We detect an accelerated wastage of these glaciers in recent years, and marked differences in mass change and its sensitivity to climate change for different regions and size classes. In particular, higher mass loss and temperature sensitivity are observed for glaciers smaller than 0.5 km2. In addition to temperature rise, a decrease in precipitation in the western part of the region and an increase in precipitation in the eastern part likely contribute to significant sub-region differences in mass loss.

In this study, the Gini coefficient is used to measure inequality of provincial water footprints (WFs), which are computed based on the China multi-regional input–output table in 30 provinces. The inequality analysis indicates that in China, albeit improved equality of the WF via virtual water (VW) transfers in comparison to the real water use, provincial WFs still present inequality (with Gini coefficient 0.22). Inequality decomposition techniques are used to examine the main sectoral contributor and drivers of WF inequality. The decomposition of inequality in the total WF by sectoral water use types indicates that agricultural WF is the largest contributor, contributing 45.7% of the total inequality, followed by industrial WF (36.9%), tertiary WF (11.1%) and domestic water use (6.3%). Inequality decomposition in the total WF by drivers shows that the effect of natural water availability is insignificant. The main drivers of inequality in agricultural WF are real water use and water use efficiency, with the inter-class effect overwhelming inter-class effect based on classification according to these factors.

Ground motion was monitored by exploiting SAR images from the ENVISAT (2003–2009), Cosmo-SkyMed (2011–2014) and Sentinel-1A (2015–2016) satellites. PSInSAR results show an inelastic deformation in the aquifer and small land surface displacements (up to −55 mm). The most widespread land subsidence is detected during the ENVISAT period (2003–2009), which coincided with a long, dry period in the region. The highest displacement rates recorded during this period (up to 10 mm/yr) were detected in the central part of the aquifer, where many villages are located. For this period, there is a good correlation between groundwater level depletion and the augmentation of the average subsidence velocity and slight hydraulic head changes (<2 m) have a rapid ground motion response. The Cosmo-SkyMed period (2011–2014) coincided with a rainy period, and the land subsidence is only concentrated in some points. Rates of average subsidence up to 11.5 mm/yr are obtained for this period and are anthropogenic in origin, being related to earthmoving works. During the Sentinel-1A monitoring period (2015–2016) most of the region showed no deformation, except for some points of unknown origin in the NE sector. A general conclusion is that there is a clear lithological control in the spatial distribution of ground subsidence; all the subsiding areas detected are located where a higher clay content was identified. Although the SE sector of the aquifer had more intense groundwater exploitation, no land subsidence processes were detected, as coarse-grained sediments predominate in the substratum. This research will contribute to the drawing-up of a management plan for the sustainable use of this strategic aquifer, taking into account critical levels of groundwater depletion to avoid land subsidence in the areas identified as vulnerable.

The uncertainties of four sensitive parameters, including soil conservation service runoff curve number to moisture condition II (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), plant available water capacity (SOL_AWC), and soil depth (SOL_Z), are investigated. Results reveal that (i) CN2 has positive effect on peak flow, implying that the concentrated rainfall during rainy season can cause infiltration-excess surface flow, which is an considerable contributor to peak flow in this watershed; (ii) SOL_K has positive effect on average flow, implying that the widely distributed cambisols can lead to medium percolation capacity; (iii) the interaction between SOL_AWC and SOL_Z has noticeable effect on the peak flow and their effects are dependent upon each other, which discloses that soil depth can significant influence the processes of plant uptake of soil water in this watershed. Based on the above findings, the significant parameters and the relationship among uncertain parameters can be specified, such that hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources of the Jinghe River watershed can be improved. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:15:41","2018-01-19 23:15:41","","750-762","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; algorithm; parameter estimation; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization; Bayesian analysis; Bayesian networks; hydrological modeling; Climate models; water resource; Inference engines; watershed; Watersheds; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; hydrological response; Soil conservation; hydraulic conductivity; Evolutionary algorithms; Bayesian inference; factor analysis; Loess Plateau; peak flow; soil depth; soil conservation; percolation; Solvents; Jing Basin; available water capacity; DREAM; Factorial analysis; Interactive effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only hypothetical causal factors were presented, and the reasons for the occurrence of both clockwise and counterclockwise hysteretic functions were unclear. The current study aims to address this by exploring further Poyang Lake's hysteretic behavior, including consideration of stage-flow relationships. Remotely sensed imagery is used to validate the water surface areas produced by hydrodynamic modeling. Stage-area relationships obtained using the two methods are in strong agreement. The new results reveal a three-phase hydrological regime in stage-flow relationships, which assists in developing improved physical interpretation of hysteretic stage-area relationships for the lake-floodplain system. For stage-area relationships, clockwise hysteresis is the result of classic floodplain hysteretic processes (e.g., restricted drainage of the floodplain during recession), whereas counterclockwise hysteresis derives from the river hysteresis effect (i.e., caused by backwater effects). The river hysteresis effect is enhanced by the time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and Yangtze discharge (i.e., the so-called Yangtze River blocking effect). The time lag also leads to clockwise hysteresis in the relationship between Yangtze River discharge and lake stage. Thus, factors leading to hysteresis in other rivers, lakes and floodplains act in combination within Poyang Lake to create spatial variability in hydrological hysteresis. These effects dominate at different times, in different parts of the lake, and during different phases of the lake's water level fluctuations, creating the unique hysteretic hydrological behavior of Poyang Lake. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:16:33","2018-01-19 23:16:33","","574-583","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; catchment; hydrology; river discharge; river flow; remote sensing; Rivers; Floods; hydrodynamics; floodplain; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; model validation; Catchments; Banks (bodies of water); Water levels; Lakes; water level; inflow; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake; Yangtze River; hydrological regime; Spatial variability; Remotely sensed imagery; Produced Water; Hysteresis; hysteresis; Water-level fluctuation; Flood plains; Clocks; Hysteretic behavior; Optical resonators; Physical interpretation; Po-yang lakes; River flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationship among convergence rates (i.e., the rate of fluid saturation with varying injection time) and the macroscopic properties and structural parameters of porous media have been anticipated. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) micro-imaging to obtain images (down to ∼50 μm resolution) of the distribution of water injected for varying durations into porous networks that were initially saturated with silicone oil. We then established the relationships among the convergence rates, structural parameters, and transport properties of porous networks. The volume fraction of the water phase increases as the water injection duration increases. The 3D images of the water distributions for silica gel samples are similar to those of the glass bead samples. The changes in water saturation (and the accompanying removal of silicone oil) and the variations in the volume fraction, specific surface area, and cube-counting fractal dimension of the water phase fit well with the single-exponential recovery function f(t)=a[1-exp(-λt)]. The asymptotic values (a, i.e., saturated value) of the properties of the volume fraction, specific surface area, and cube-counting fractal dimension of the glass bead samples were greater than those for the silica gel samples primarily because of the intrinsic differences in the porous networks and local distribution of the pore size and connectivity. The convergence rates of all of the properties are inversely proportional to the entropy length and permeability. Despite limitations of the current study, such as insufficient resolution and uncertainty for the estimated parameters due to sparsely selected short injection times, the observed trends highlight the first analyses of the cube-counting fractal dimension (and other structural properties) and convergence rates in porous networks consisting of two fluid components. These results indicate that the convergence rates correlate with the geometric factor that characterizes the porous networks and transport property of the porous networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:16:47","2018-01-19 23:16:47","","637-650","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","connectivity; convergence; Uncertainty analysis; distribution system; Water supply systems; Oil well flooding; water flow; Geometry; porous medium; imaging method; surface area; Pore size; pore space; sand; permeability; Water injection; saturation; Porous materials; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Transport properties; immiscible fluid; entropy; Glass; Granular materials; Magnetism; nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance; volume; Convergence rates; Degree of saturations; Immiscible fluids; Intrinsic differences; Macroscopic properties; Micro-imaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Resonance; Silica; Silica gel; Silicones; Specific surface area; Structural heterogeneity; Structural properties; Volume fraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From August 2014 to July 2015, samples of rainwater, river water, groundwater, bulk soil water at five soil depths (i.e. 0–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, 120–150 cm), and xylem water of G. biloba, were collected and their δ18O and δ2H values were measured. Generally, the δ18O and δ2H values for xylem water, groundwater, and soil water clustered together and separated from those of river water, suggesting the possible occurrence of ecohydrological separation. However, the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) values of most xylem water were positive, indicating a mixture of different water sources. Significant correlations were observed between the contributions of precipitation, soil water, and groundwater to water uptake by G. biloba, further supporting ecohydrological connectivity rather than ecohydrological separation. G. biloba switched its major water sources from soil water at 0–60 cm depth and precipitation in the wet summer, to soil water from &gt;90 cm depth and groundwater in the dry winter. The river water was a minor water source for G. biloba, but its contribution was comparatively greater at the site closest to the river bank. Our findings contribute to understanding of plant–soil–water relationships and the water balance, and may provide important information for investigations of nutrient sources and sinks in riparian zones.

This study investigates concurrent hydrological drought in the Poyang lake-catchment-river system from 1960 to 2013 based on copula functions. The standard water level index (SWI) and the standard runoff index (SRI) are employed to identify hydrological drought in the lake-catchment-river system. The appropriate marginal distributions and copulas are selected by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian copulas selection method. The probability of hydrological drought in Poyang Lake in any given year is 16.6% (return period of 6 years), and droughts occurred six times from 2003 to 2013. Additionally, the joint probability of concurrent drought events between the lake and catchment is 10.1% (return period of 9.9 years). Since 2003, concurrent drought has intensified in spring due to frequent hydrological drought in the catchment. The joint probability of concurrent drought between the lake and the Yangtze River is 11.5% (return period of 8.7 years). This simultaneous occurrence intensified in spring, summer and autumn from 2003 to 2013 due to the weakened blocking effect of the Yangtze River. Notably, although the lake drought intensified in winter during the past decade, hydrological drought in the catchment and the Yangtze River did not intensify simultaneously. Thus, this winter intensification might be caused by human activities in the lake region. The results of this study demonstrate that the Poyang lake-catchment-river system has been drying since 2003 based on a statistical approach.

The model are first validated by both analytical model and simulation model. Then new Blasingame type curves are established. Finally, the effects of critical parameters on the rate decline characteristics of MFHWs are discussed. The results show that heterogeneity has significant influence on the rate decline characteristics of MFHWs; the parameters related to the MFHWs, such as fracture conductivity and length also can affect the rate characteristics of MFHWs.

Therefore, our model can be used to predict rate performance more accurately for MFHWs in heterogeneous reservoir.

However, there is large uncertainty among existing ET products from Landsat that limit their application. This study presents a simple Taylor skill fusion (STS) method that merges five Landsat-based ET products and directly measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) to improve the global estimation of terrestrial ET. The STS method uses a weighted average of the individual ET products and weights are determined by their Taylor skill scores (S). The validation with site-scale measurements at 206 EC flux towers showed large differences and uncertainties among the five ET products. The merged ET product exhibited the best performance with a decrease in the averaged root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 2–5 W/m2 when compared to the individual products. To evaluate the reliability of the STS method at the regional scale, the weights of the STS method for these five ET products were determined using EC ground-measurements. An example of regional ET mapping demonstrates that the STS-merged ET can effectively integrate the individual Landsat ET products.

In response to this problem, a generalized fuzzy credibility-constrained linear fractional programming (GFCCFP) model is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation under uncertainty. The model can be derived from integrating generalized fuzzy credibility-constrained programming (GFCCP) into a linear fractional programming (LFP) optimization framework. Therefore, it can solve ratio optimization problems associated with fuzzy parameters, and examine the variation of results under different credibility levels and weight coefficients of possibility and necessary. It has advantages in: (1) balancing the economic and resources objectives directly; (2) analyzing system efficiency; (3) generating more flexible decision solutions by giving different credibility levels and weight coefficients of possibility and (4) supporting in-depth analysis of the interrelationships among system efficiency, credibility level and weight coefficient. The model is applied to a case study of irrigation water allocation in the middle reaches of Heihe River Basin, northwest China. Therefore, optimal irrigation water allocation solutions from the GFCCFP model can be obtained. Moreover, factorial analysis on the two parameters (i.e. λ and γ) indicates that the weight coefficient is a main factor compared with credibility level for system efficiency.

To this end, this study proposed a methodology to develop (1) a series of multi-phase and multi-layer sediment-flood conjunctive release modes and (2) a specialized SC numerical model for a combined reservoir–reach system. The conjunctive release modes involve (1) an optimization model where the decision variables are multi-phase reduction/scaling ratios and the timings to generate a superior total release hydrograph for flood control (Phase I: phase prior to flood arrival, Phase II/III: phase prior to/subsequent to peak flow) and (2) a combination method with physical limitations regarding separation of the singular hydrograph into multi-layer release hydrographs for sediment control. This study employed the featured signals obtained from statistical quartiles/sediment duration curve in mesh segmentation, and an iterative optimization model with a sediment unit response matrix and corresponding geophysical-based acceleration factors, for efficient parameter calibration. This research applied the developed methodology to the Shihmen Reservoir basin in Taiwan. The trade-off analytical results using Typhoons Sinlaku and Jangmi as case examples revealed that owing to gravity current and re-suspension effects, Phase I + II can de-silt safely without violating the intake's turbidity limitation before reservoir discharge reaches 2238 m3/s; however, Phase III can only de-silt after the release at spillway reaches 827 m3/s, and before reservoir discharge reaches 1924 m3/s, with corresponding maximum desiltation ratio being 0.221 and 0.323, respectively. Moreover, the model construction results demonstrated that the self-adaption/fuzzy inference of ANFIS can effectively simulate the SC hydrograph in an unsteady state for suspended load-dominated water bodies, and that the real-time recurrent deterministic routing of RTRLNN can accurately simulate that of a bedload-dominated flow regime. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:18:38","2018-01-19 23:18:38","","596-623","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; artificial neural network; discharge; optimization; Recurrent neural networks; trade-off; Optimization; Rivers; Floods; Sedimentation; Sediments; Flood control; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; numerical model; Economic and social effects; fuzzy mathematics; flood control; hydrograph; real time; Curve fitting; Reservoirs (water); Iterative methods; sedimentation; Fuzzy logic; Reservoir management; Sediment concentration; Hurricanes; Taiwan; multivariate analysis; turbidity; Turbidity; Silt; Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Flood management; Intelligent control; Multiobjective tradeoff analysis; Real-time recurrent learning; Shihmen Reservoir; typhoon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recovery effectiveness (REN) index quantifies the performance of these ASR systems. REN is the proportion of the injected water that the same ASR well can recapture during subsequent extraction periods. To estimate REN for individual ASR wells, the presented procedure uses finely discretized groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling. Then, the procedure uses multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) analysis to identify the significant variables affecting REN, and to identify the most recovery-effective wells. Achieving REN values close to 100% is the desire of the studied 14-well ASR system operator. This recovery is feasible for most of the ASR wells by extracting three times the injectate volume during the same year as injection. Most of the wells would achieve RENs below 75% if extracting merely the same volume as they injected. In other words, recovering almost all the same water molecules that are injected requires having a pre-existing water right to extract groundwater annually. MARS shows that REN most significantly correlates with groundwater flow velocity, or hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient. MARS results also demonstrate that maximizing REN requires utilizing the wells located in areas with background Darcian groundwater velocities less than 0.03 m/d. The study also highlights the superiority of MARS over regular multiple linear regressions to identify the wells that can provide the maximum REN. This is the first reported application of MARS for evaluating performance of an ASR system in fresh water aquifers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:18:53","2018-01-19 23:18:53","","540-548","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Regression analysis; regression analysis; Hydrogeology; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Extraction; Water; Recovery; groundwater flow; Flow velocity; hydraulic conductivity; Hydraulic gradients; Multiple linear regressions; solute transport; Solute transport; flow velocity; Aquifer storage and recovery; Transport modeling; Groundwater flow and contaminant transports; Groundwater velocity; Molecules; Significant variables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, fast and high-quality model calibration is a valuable improvement. This paper describes a novel methodology and software for the optimisation of a rainfall-runoff modelling using a genetic algorithm (GA) with a newly prepared concept of a random number generator (HRNG), which is the core of the optimisation. The GA estimates model parameters using evolutionary principles, which requires a quality number generator. The new HRNG generates random numbers based on hydrological information and it provides better numbers compared to pure software generators. The GA enhances the model calibration very well and the goal is to optimise the calibration of the model with a minimum of user interaction. This article focuses on improving the internal structure of the GA, which is shielded from the user. The results that we obtained indicate that the HRNG provides a stable trend in the output quality of the model, despite various configurations of the GA. In contrast to previous research, the HRNG speeds up the calibration of the model and offers an improvement of rainfall-runoff modelling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:19:25","2018-01-19 23:19:25","","350-355","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Optimization; Genetic algorithms; Rainfall - Runoff modelling; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Optimisations; Calibration of rainfall-runoff models; Internal structure; Number theory; Random generators; Random number generation; Random number generators; Software generators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, soil water and soil temperature at 20, 40, 60, 80 cm depths in six positions were simultaneously monitored at high frequency to confirm the occurrence of PF at a typical Benggang slope underlain granite residual deposits, and to determine the interaction of soil moisture distribution and Benggang erosion. In the presence of PF, the soil temperature was first (half to one hour) governed by the rainwater temperature, then (more than one hour) governed by the upper soil temperature; in the absence of PF (only matrix flow, MF), the soil temperature was initially governed by the upper soil temperature, then by the rainwater temperature. The results confirmed the water replacement phenomenon in MF, thus it can be distinguished from PF by additional temperature monitoring. It indicates that high frequency moisture and temperature monitoring can determine the occurrence of PF and reveal the soil water movement. The distribution of soil water content and PF on the different positions of the slope showed that a higher frequency of PF resulted in a higher variation of average of water content. The frequency of PF at the lower position can be three times as that of the upper position, therefore, the variation coefficient of soil water content increased from 4.67% to 12.68% at the upper position to 8.18%–33.12% at the lower position, where the Benggang erosion (soil collapse) was more possible.

For uniform particles, power-law-distributed resting times Tr produced super-, sub- or normal diffusion regimes for certain values of the tail exponent ν. Based on the assumption that heterogeneity in particle size leads to a power-law distribution of Tr, a completely different diffusion regime emerges in mixtures compared with those obtained from uniform particles with the same value of the tail exponent ν. Mixtures exhibited the same ballistic regime (the variance of travel distance grows as time squared) for different values of ν, and ballistic regimes for mixtures also emerged from several other tested models. Furthermore, our experimental results confirmed the ballistic regime; however, the decreasing number of tracked particles may result in apparent but deceptive sub-diffusion.

The microtopographical differences in polygonal geomorphology produce heterogeneity in permafrost depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil geochemistry, and plant distribution. Few measurements have been made, however, of how water fluxes vary across polygonal tundra plant types, limiting our ability to understand and model these ecosystems. Our objective was to investigate how plant distribution and geomorphological location affect actual evapotranspiration (ET). These effects are especially critical in light of the rapid change polygonal tundra systems are experiencing with Arctic warming. At a field site near Barrow, Alaska, USA, we investigated the relationships between ET and plant cover in 2014 and 2015. ET was measured at a range of spatial and temporal scales using: (1) An eddy covariance flux tower for continuous landscape-scale monitoring; (2) An automated clear surface chamber over dry vegetation in a fixed location for continuous plot-scale monitoring; and (3) Manual measurements with a clear portable chamber in approximately 60 locations across the landscape. We found that variation in environmental conditions and plant community composition, driven by microtopographical features, has significant influence on ET. Among plant types, ET from moss-covered and inundated areas was more than twice that from other plant types. ET from troughs and low polygonal centers was significantly higher than from high polygonal centers. ET varied seasonally, with peak fluxes of 0.14 mm h−1 in July. Despite 24 hours of daylight in summer, diurnal fluctuations in incoming solar radiation and plant processes produced a diurnal cycle in ET. Combining the patterns we observed with projections for the impact of permafrost degradation on polygonal structure suggests that microtopographic changes associated with permafrost thaw have the potential to alter tundra ecosystem ET. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:20:26","2018-01-19 23:20:26","","816-825","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; United States; evapotranspiration; greenhouse gas; solar radiation; Ecology; Environmental conditions; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; seasonal variation; Soil moisture; Soils; geomorphology; Landforms; Plants (botany); Location; Actual evapotranspiration; soil temperature; Bryophyta; environmental conditions; Spatial and temporal scale; permafrost; Permafrost; Alaska; Arctic; plant community; Permafrost degradation; tundra; moss; Moss; Arctic tundra; Barrow; community composition; Diurnal fluctuations; Geomorphological units","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peaks-over-threshold analysis reveals the top 16 most-impactful (storm surge) systems in the general return-period range of 1–100 years. Hurricane Matthew (2016) broke the record with a new absolute maximum water level of 1.56 m, although the peak surge occurred during slack tide level (0.00 m). Hurricanes and tropical systems contribute to return periods of 10–100 years with water levels in the approximate range of 1.3–1.55 m. Extratropical systems and nor'easters contribute to the historical storm population (in the general return-period range of 1–10 years) and are capable of producing extreme storm surges (in the approximate range of 1.15–1.3 m) on par with those generated by hurricanes and tropical systems. The highest astronomical tide is 1.02 m, which by evaluation of the historical record can contribute as much as 94% to the total storm-tide water level. Statically, a hypothetical scenario of Hurricane Matthew's peak surge coinciding with the highest astronomical tide would yield an overall storm-tide water level of 2.58 m, corresponding to an approximate 1000-year return period by historical comparison.

It contributes approximately 13% of the Amazon River flow and it may contribute up to 50% of its sediment discharge to the Atlantic Ocean. Until now, the suspended sediment load of the Madeira River was not well known and was estimated in a broad range from 240 to 715 Mt yr−1. Since 2002, the HYBAM international network developed a new monitoring programme specially designed to provide more reliable data than in previous intents. It is based on the continuous monitoring of a set of 11 gauging stations in the Madeira River watershed from the Andes piedmont to the confluence with the Amazon River, and discrete sampling of the suspended sediment concentration every 7 or 10 days. This paper presents the results of the suspended sediment data obtained in the Madeira drainage basin during 2002–2011. The Madeira River suspended sediment load is estimated at 430 Mt yr−1 near its confluence with the Amazon River. The average production of the Madeira River Andean catchment is estimated at 640 Mt yr−1 (±30%), the corresponding sediment yield for the Andes is estimated at 3000 t km−2 yr−1 (±30%), and the average denudation rate is estimated at 1.20 mm yr−1 (±30%). Contrary to previous results that had mentioned high sedimentation rates in the Beni River floodplain, we detected no measurable sedimentation process in this part of the basin. On the Mamoré River basin, we observed heavy sediment deposition of approximately 210 Mt yr−1 that seem to confirm previous studies. But while these studies mentioned heavy sedimentation in the floodplain, we showed that sediment deposition occurred mainly in the Andean piedmont and immediate foreland in rivers (Parapeti, Grande, Pirai, Yapacani, Chimoré, Chaparé, Secure, Maniqui) with discharges that are not sufficiently large to transport their sediment load downstream in the lowlands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:20:58","2018-01-19 23:20:58","","35-48","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; river flow; Rivers; Floods; sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; watershed; Watersheds; floodplain; Catchments; Deposition; Erosion; Banks (bodies of water); Brazil; sediment budget; Andes; sediment yield; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; Suspended sediment concentrations; drainage basin; Amazon Basin; Peru; Bolivia; Suspended sediment loads; erosion rate; Erosion rates; sedimentation rate; Amazon River; Continuous monitoring; Amazon basin; Annual flux; Beni River; International networks; Madeira Basin; Madeira River; River suspended sediments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key role of water resources in economic strategic development is empirically illustrated. The article demonstrates the practicability of strategic management of water resources based on the principle of a combination of river basin management approaches and the consideration of regional development strategies. The Game Theory technique was used to develop economic and mathematical tools for supporting decision-making in meeting the needs of regional consumers under water balance deficit conditions. The choice of methods was determined from two positions: the methods should allow for the possibility of multi-variant solutions for the selection of optimal options for the distribution of limited water resources between different consumers; the methods should be orientated on the maximum possible harmonization of multidirectional and multi-scale interests of the subjects in the water management system of the different regions (including the state) in order to achieve a balance.

A prerequisite for accurately simulating DNAPL migration in aquifers is then the determination of the permeability, entry pressure and corresponding representative elementary volumes (REV) of porous media. However, the permeability, entry pressure and corresponding representative elementary volumes (REV) are hard to determine clearly. This study utilizes the light transmission micro-tomography (LTM) method to determine the permeability and entry pressure of two dimensional (2D) translucent porous media and integrates the LTM with a criterion of relative gradient error to quantify the corresponding REV of porous media. As a result, the DNAPL migration in porous media might be accurately simulated by discretizing the model at the REV dimension. To validate the quantification methods, an experiment of perchloroethylene (PCE) migration is conducted in a two-dimensional heterogeneous bench-scale aquifer cell. Based on the quantifications of permeability, entry pressure and REV scales of 2D porous media determined by the LTM and relative gradient error, different models with different sizes of discretization grid are used to simulate the PCE migration. It is shown that the model based on REV size agrees well with the experimental results over the entire migration period including calibration, verification and validation processes. This helps to better understand the microstructures of porous media and achieve accurately simulating DNAPL migration in aquifers based on the REV estimation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:21:30","2018-01-19 23:21:30","","276-288","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","simulation; Hydrogeology; heterogeneity; aquifer; Aquifers; accuracy assessment; Discretizations; porous medium; estimation method; permeability; Porous materials; Mechanical permeability; Light transmission; Representative elementary volume; Subsurface environment; two-dimensional flow; Dense non-aqueous phase liquids; discrete element method; Entry pressures; hydrostatic pressure; microstructure; Microstructure; nonaqueous phase liquid; Quantification methods; Simulation accuracy; tetrachloroethylene; Verification-and-validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are various computational methods to estimate soil moisture and their complexity varies greatly: from one box with vertically constant volumetric soil water content to fully saturated-unsaturated coupled physically-based models. Different complexity levels are applicable depending on the simulation scale, computational time limitations, input data and knowledge about the parameters. The Vertical Equilibrium Model (VEM) is a simple approach to estimate the catchment-wide soil water storage at a daily time-scale on the basis of water table level observations, soil properties and an assumption of hydrological equilibrium without vertical fluxes above the water table. In this study VEM was extended by considering vertical fluxes, which allows conditions with evaporation and infiltration to be represented. The aim was to test the hypothesis that the simulated volumetric soil water content significantly depends on vertical fluxes. The water content difference between the no-flux, equilibrium approach and the new constant-flux approach greatly depended on the soil textural class, ranging between ∼1% for silty clay and ∼44% for sand at an evapotranspiration rate of 5 mm·d−1. The two approaches gave a mean volumetric soil water content difference of ∼1 mm for two case studies (sandy loam and organic rich soils). The results showed that for many soil types the differences in estimated storage between the no-flux and the constant flux approaches were relatively small. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:21:45","2018-01-19 23:21:45","","798-804","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; evapotranspiration; model; soil moisture; hypothesis testing; Groundwater; Physically based models; infiltration; Water supply; Catchments; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; water storage; Digital storage; hillslope; estimation method; equilibrium; Soil water content; Moisture; Water storage; water table; moisture content; flux measurement; Soil testing; Water content; soil texture; volume; Catchment hydrology; Equilibrium approaches; Soil water storage; Vertical equilibriums; Vertical fluxes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A well-characterized case study in Italy, with a hydrogeological database of 471 results from hydraulic tests performed on the aquifer and the surrounding 2-km-long cement-bentonite (CB) walls, was used to build a conceptual model and assess a representative remediation site adopting coupled technologies. In the studied area, the aquifer hydraulic conductivity Ka [m/d] is log-normally distributed with mean E(Ya)=0.32, variance σYa 2=6.36 (Ya=lnKa) and spatial correlation well described by an exponential isotropic variogram with integral scale less than 1/12 the domain size. The hardened CB wall's hydraulic conductivity, Kw [m/d], displayed strong scaling effects and a lognormal distribution with mean E(Yw)=-3.43 and σYw 2=0.53 (Yw=log10Kw). No spatial correlation of Kw was detected. Using this information, conservative transport was simulated across a CB wall in spatially correlated 1-D random Ya fields within a numerical Monte Carlo framework. Multiple scenarios representing different Kw values were tested. A continuous solute source with known concentration and deterministic drains’ discharge rates were assumed. The efficiency of the confining system was measured by the probability of exceedance of concentration over a threshold (C∗) at a control section 10 years after the initial solute release. It was found that the stronger the aquifer heterogeneity, the higher the expected efficiency of the confinement system and the lower the likelihood of aquifer pollution. This behavior can be explained because, for the analyzed aquifer conditions, a lower Ka generates more pronounced drawdown in the water table in the proximity of the drain and consequently a higher advective flux towards the confined area, which counteracts diffusive fluxes across the walls. Thus, a higher σYa 2 results in a larger amount of low Ka values in the proximity of the drain, and a higher probability of not exceeding C∗. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:22:33","2018-01-19 23:22:33","","805-815","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; database; discharge; Uncertainty; Hydrogeology; Normal distribution; hydrogeology; heterogeneity; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Stochastic systems; Water levels; Efficiency; stochasticity; variogram; hydraulic conductivity; Risks; water table; efficiency measurement; Hydraulic conductivity; solute transport; Solute transport; pumping; Log-normal distribution; drawdown; Aquifer heterogeneity; Cutoff wall; Heterogeneous aquifers; Hydrogeological database; Probability of exceedance; Pump and treat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that, in water-limited regions, baseflow (Qb) changes are partly due (along with climate variability) to groundwater abstraction. For a more realistic assessment, the analysis was conducted in two different sets of unregulated catchments, located outside and inside the Eagle Ford play. Three periods were considered in the analysis related to HF activities: pre-development (1980–2000), moderate (2001–2008) and intensive (2009–2015) periods. Results indicate that in the Eagle Ford play region, temporal changes in baseflow cannot be directly related to the increase in hydraulic fracturing. Instead, substantial baseflow declines during the intensive period of hydraulic fracturing represent the aggregated effects from the combination of: (1) a historical exceptional drought during 2011–2012; (2) increased groundwater-based irrigation; and (3) an intensive hydraulic fracturing activity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:22:48","2018-01-19 23:22:48","","160-171","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various approaches have been developed to simulate flow and transport through the fractured rock. The approaches can be broadly divided into Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) and Equivalent Continuum Model (ECM). The DFN explicitly represents individual fractures, while the ECM uses fracture properties to determine equivalent continuum parameters. We compare DFN and ECM in terms of upscaled observed transport properties through generic fracture networks. The major effort was directed on making the DFN and ECM approaches similar in their conceptual representations. This allows for separating differences related to the interpretation of the test conditions and parameters from the differences between the DFN and ECM approaches. The two models are compared using a benchmark test problem that is constructed to represent the far field (1 × 1 × 1 km3) of a hypothetical repository in fractured crystalline rock. The test problem setting uses generic fracture properties that can be expected in crystalline rocks. The models are compared in terms of the: 1) effective permeability of the domain, and 2) nonreactive solute breakthrough curves through the domain. The principal differences between the models are mesh size, network connectivity, matrix diffusion and anisotropy. We demonstrate how these differences affect the flow and transport.

Trends in annual minimum, mean, and maximum groundwater levels for 205 monitoring wells were analyzed across three regions of the system (East, Central, West Central) for four time periods: 1964–2013, 1974–2013, 1984–2013, and 1994–2013. Trends were computed separately for wells in the glacial aquifer system with low potential for human influence on groundwater levels and ones with high potential influence from activities such as groundwater pumping. Generally there were more wells with significantly increasing groundwater levels (levels closer to ground surface) than wells with significantly decreasing levels. The highest numbers of significant increases for all four time periods were with annual minimum and/or mean levels. There were many more wells with significant increases from 1964 to 2013 than from more recent periods, consistent with low precipitation in the 1960s. Overall there were low numbers of wells with significantly decreasing trends regardless of time period considered; the highest number of these were generally for annual minimum groundwater levels at wells with likely human influence. There were substantial differences in the number of wells with significant groundwater-level trends over time, depending on whether the historical time series are assumed to be independent, have short-term persistence, or have long-term persistence. Mean annual groundwater levels have significant lag-one-year autocorrelation at 26.0% of wells in the East region, 65.4% of wells in the Central region, and 100% of wells in the West Central region.

This paper investigates their impact on streamflow modelling throughout a large catchment. They are assessed by successively refining the spatial information of climatic inputs and model parameters, going from the lumped to the sub-catchment or mesh scale. The analysis is conducted according to a spatial split-sample test. For each resolution, the distributed model first calibrated on calibration station(s) is then evaluated in light of this(these) station(s) in addition to validation stations previously treated as ungauged. For that purpose, simulated and observed streamflows are compared focusing on four hydrological signatures: daily runoff, daily regime, flood and low flow. The above framework is applied at the daily time step over a French basin, the Loire catchment at Gien covering 35,707 km2, whose streamflow data are available at the catchment outlet and 105 interior points. The results show that spatially distributed climatic forcing greatly enhances the four signatures as the resolution increases, until the right rainfall volume is provided for each simulation point. By taking advantage of the interior calibration stations to spatialise the parameters, the model's performance progresses again but to a lesser extent. Finally, the catchment's hydrological behaviour is mainly driven by the spatial variability of the climatic inputs (around 90% over the validation stations), while that of the parameters seems to be of second order. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:23:35","2018-01-19 23:23:35","","13-25","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Runoff; catchment; low flow; rainfall; streamflow; hydrological modeling; runoff; Canada; testing method; Catchments; France; Distributed modeling; spatial variation; hydrological response; Hydrological response; flood; Ontario [Canada]; Stream flow; Model parameters; Spatial variability; Distributed hydrological modelling; French River; Loire River; Resolution increase; Spatial informations; Split sample tests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a gaged site, an FDC can be easily estimated with frequency analysis. When no streamflow records are available, regional FDCs are used to synthesize FDCs. However, studies on how to develop FDCs for sites with short-term records have been very limited. Deriving representative FDC when there are short-term hydrologic records is important. For instance, 43% of the 394 streamflow gages in Illinois have records of 20 years or fewer, and these short-term gages are often distributed in headwaters and contain valuable hydrologic information. In this study, the index gage method is proposed to develop FDCs using short-term hydrologic records via an information transfer technique from a nearby hydrologically similar index gage. There are three steps: (1) select an index gage; (2) determine changes of FDC; and (3) develop representative FDCs. The approach is tested using records from 92 U.S. Geological Survey streamflow gages in Illinois. A jackknife experiment is conducted to assess the performance. Bootstrap resampling is used to simulate various periods of records, i.e., 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years of records. The results demonstrated that the index gage method is capable of developing a representative FDC using short-term records. Generally, the approach performance is improved when more hydrologic records are available, but the improvement appears to level off when the short-term gage has 10 years or more records. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:23:49","2018-01-19 23:23:49","","119-129","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Flow duration curve; United States; hydrology; streamflow; numerical method; sampling; experimental design; Illinois; Gages; Stream flow; index method; Bootstrap resampling; headwater; U.s. geological surveys; Electric network topology; Streamflow variability; Frequency Analysis; Information transfers; Jackknife; Short term","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes an intelligent water allocation methodology for establishing optimal inter-basin water allocation schemes and assessing the impacts of water transfer projects on water-demanding sectors in the Hanjiang River Basin of China. We first analyze water demands for water allocation purpose, and then search optimal water allocation strategies for maximizing the water supply to water-demanding sectors and mitigating the negative impacts by using the Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) and Adaptive Genetic Algorithm (AGA), respectively. Lastly, the performance indexes of the water supply system are evaluated under different scenarios of inter-basin water transfer projects. The results indicate that: the AGA with adaptive crossover and mutation operators could increase the average annual water transfer from the Hanjiang River by 0.79 billion m3 (8.8%), the average annual water transfer from the Changjiang River by 0.18 billion m3 (6.5%), and the average annual hydropower generation by 0.49 billion kW h (5.4%) as well as reduce the average annual unmet water demand by 0.40 billion m3 (9.7%), as compared with the those of the SGA. We demonstrate that the proposed intelligent water allocation schemes can significantly mitigate the negative impacts of inter-basin water transfer projects on the reliability, vulnerability and resilience of water supply to the demanding sectors in water-supplying basins. This study has a direct bearing on more intelligent and effectual water allocation management under various scenarios of inter-basin water transfer projects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:06","2018-01-19 23:24:06","","584-595","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water management; Water resources; optimization; performance assessment; water supply; artificial intelligence; genetic algorithm; water management; Optimization; Rivers; vulnerability; Artificial intelligence; Water supply systems; Watersheds; Water supply; river basin; Genetic algorithms; water demand; Hydro-power generation; Water allocations; River basin projects; Yangtze Basin; Inter-basin water transfer; Han River [Hubei-Shaanxi]; Adaptive crossovers; Adaptive genetic algorithms; Performance indices; project assessment; Standard genetic algorithm; Water transfer projects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The origin of these alterations has its roots in changing climatic conditions; however, its threatening implications can only be dealt with through meticulous planning that is based on realistic and skillful decadal precipitation predictions (DPPs). Skillful DPPs represent a very challenging prospect because of the complexities associated with precipitation predictions. Because of the limited skill and coarse spatial resolution, the DPPs provided by General Circulation Models (GCMs) fail to be directly applicable for impact assessment. Here, we focus on nine GCMs and quantify the seasonally and regionally averaged skill in DPPs over the continental United States. We address the problems pertaining to the limited skill and resolution by applying linear and kernel regression-based statistical downscaling approaches. For both the approaches, statistical relationships established over the calibration period (1961–1990) are applied to the retrospective and near future decadal predictions by GCMs to obtain DPPs at ∼4 km resolution. The skill is quantified across different metrics that evaluate potential skill, biases, long-term statistical properties, and uncertainty. Both the statistical approaches show improvements with respect to the raw GCM data, particularly in terms of the long-term statistical properties and uncertainty, irrespective of lead time. The outcome of the study is monthly DPPs from nine GCMs with 4-km spatial resolution, which can be used as a key input for impacts assessments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:22","2018-01-19 23:24:22","","559-573","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Continental United States; Statistics; United States; downscaling; regression analysis; Statistical downscaling; statistical analysis; flooding; Forecasting; seasonal variation; calibration; uncertainty analysis; climate prediction; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); climate effect; spatial resolution; Image resolution; general circulation model; General circulation model; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation predictions; Statistical relationship; regional pattern; Precipitation characteristics; Decadal predictions; decadal variation; Meteorological extremes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies suggest that tree leaf δ13C is correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) over a broad range of climates with precipitation between 100 and 2000 mm/year. However, this relationship confirmed at the large scale may not be present at the local scale with complex terrain where factors other than precipitation may lead to additional variability in plant water stress. In this study, we investigated δ13C of tree leaves in a native vegetation catchment over a local gradient of hydro-climatic conditions induced by two hillslopes with opposite aspects. Significant seasonal variations, calculated as a difference between the maximum and minimum δ13C values for each tree, were observed for two species, up to 1.9‰ for Eucalyptus (E.) paniculata, and up to 2.7‰ for Acacia (A.) pycnantha on the north-facing slope (NFS). Also the mean δ13C values calculated from all investigated trees of each hillslope were significantly different and leaf δ13C on the NFS was higher by 1.4 ± 0.5‰ than that on the south-facing slope (SFS). These results cannot be explained by the negligible difference in precipitation between the two hillslopes located just 200 m apart. The correlation coefficients between the δ13C of E. tree leaves and the integrated aridity index (AI) were statistically significant for temporal observations on the NFS (R2 0.18–0.44, p-value 0.00–0.06), and spatial observations (R2 = 0.35, p-value 0.05) at the end of the dry season. These results suggest that AI as a measure of plant water stress is better associated with leaf δ13C than precipitation. Therefore, leaf δ13C value can be used as a valuable proxy for plant water stress across the landscape in both time and space. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:38","2018-01-19 23:24:38","","214-223","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Runoff; catchment; dry season; Environmental conditions; vegetation cover; spatiotemporal analysis; seasonal variation; Catchments; Forestry; spatial variation; water stress; complex terrain; Plants (botany); hillslope; precipitation (climatology); South Australia; Isotopes; stable isotope; index method; growth; environmental conditions; isotopic composition; climate conditions; Mean annual precipitation; carbon isotope; plant water relations; Temporal and spatial variability; aridity; Acacia pycnantha; Aridity index; Eucalyptus paniculata; Hillslopes; Stable carbon isotope compositions; Water stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the common problem in such regions is a lack of long-term historical observations. Meteorological and hydrological station networks in some river basins in China were newly-built only a few years ago, and it is infeasible to estimate hydrological parameters from calibration and validation with a long time period directly. This paper aims to develop a method to estimate the feasible hydrological parameters based on rainfall patterns in such regions. Digital Yellow River Integrated Model (DYRIM) is adopted as the hydrological model, and the feasible hydrological parameters can be estimated based on limited rainfall-runoff events. First, for each rainfall-runoff event, the parameters are independently calibrated with the observed rainfall and hydrological data using a double-layer parallel system. Then, the performances of the simulation results are comprehensively evaluated, and the value ranges of the parameters can be obtained. Finally, the statistical relationships between hydrological parameters and rainfall patterns (i.e., amount and intensity) are established, which are expressed by the statistical equations and the distribution of hydrological parameters with the rainfall patterns. From a sample demonstration, it is concluded that this parameter estimation method will be useful to estimate the feasible hydrological parameters for future rainfall-runoff events in river basins with no long-term historical observations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:24:55","2018-01-19 23:24:55","","651-661","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; China; Rain; Runoff; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; simulation; parameter estimation; Estimation; Rivers; Parameter estimation; integrated approach; numerical model; calibration; Watersheds; Integrated modeling; model validation; river basin; Calibration and validations; River basins; historical record; feasibility study; Rainfall patterns; Hydrological parameters; long-term change; Statistical relationship; Yellow River; Parameter estimation method; Hydrological station networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assessment procedure relies on an extensive set of graphical and numerical performance criteria to identify the most suitable models that could provide the most accurate and most robust extreme rainfall estimates. The proposed systematic assessment approach has been shown to be more efficient and more robust than the traditional model selection method based on only limited goodness-of-fit criteria. To test the feasibility of the proposed procedure, an illustrative application was carried out using 5-min, 1-h, and 24-h annual maximum rainfall data from a network of 21 raingages located in the Ontario region in Canada. Results have indicated that the GEV, GNO, and PE3 models were the best models for describing the distribution of daily and sub-daily annual maximum rainfalls in this region.

To investigate this, multiple high resolution time series measurements of radium across a tidal estuary (Coffs Creek, NSW, Australia) were performed as well as a spatial survey in both bottom and surface layers. Results from the spatial survey revealed increasing radium concentrations in parts of the estuary surrounded by mangroves. The average radium concentration in estuary areas lined with mangroves was 2.5 times higher than the average concentration at the mouth of the estuary and 6.5-fold higher than upstream freshwater areas. Additionally, the area enriched in radium coincided with low dissolved oxygen concentrations, implying that porewater exchange may drive anoxia. A radium mass balance model based on 223Ra and 224Ra isotopes at different sections of the estuary confirmed higher porewater exchange rates from areas fringed with mangrove vegetation. Estimated porewater exchange rates were 27.8 ± 5.3 and 13.6 ± 2.1 cm d−1 (0.8 ± 0.1 and 0.4 ± 0.1 m3 s−1) based on 223Ra and 224Ra isotopes, respectively. The average saline porewater exchange was ∼ 10-fold larger than the upstream surface freshwater inputs to the estuary. We suggest that mangrove environments within subtropical estuaries are hotspots for porewater exchange due to the complex belowground structure of crab burrows and the effect of tidal pumping. Because porewater exchange releases carbon and nitrogen from coastal sediments, development and modification of mangrove areas in subtropical estuaries have a significant effect on coastal biogeochemical cycles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:25:25","2018-01-19 23:25:25","","188-198","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Groundwater; Water; Carbon; Biogeochemistry; Dissolved oxygen; Isotopes; Surveys; Groundwater exchanges; Biogeochemical cycle; Estuaries; Seepage; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Tropics; Submarine groundwater discharge; Average concentration; Carbon and nitrogen; Finance; Low dissolved oxygen; Radium; Radium concentrations; Radon; Sub-tropical estuary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a novel spatiotemporal hybrid method is proposed to verify and imputed spatiotemporal missing values. This new method, termed SOM-FLSSVM, flexibly combines three advanced techniques: self-organizing feature map (SOM) clustering, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). We employ a cross-validation (CV) procedure and FOA swarm intelligence optimization strategy that can search available parameters and determine the optimal imputation model. The spatiotemporal underground water data for Minqin County, China, were selected to test the reliability and imputation ability of SOM-FLSSVM. We carried out a validation experiment and compared three well-studied models with SOM-FLSSVM using a different missing data ratio from 0.1 to 0.8 in the same data set.

Characterising changes in hydraulic properties is important for groundwater systems that are disturbed by mining. Conventional hydrogeological investigations rely on literature derived values or limited programs of field testing (e.g. pumping test) to define specific storage; but these approaches do not consider the change in compressibility that may occur due to mechanical disturbance. This paper presents, for the first time, direct in situ measurements of the changes in compressibility, and consequently specific storage, as a result of mechanical disturbance within geologic formations overlying underground mining operations. The in situ measurements of compressibility are derived in this study from the pore-pressure response to barometric loading or strains induced by earth tides. Even prior to disturbance, the compressibility obtained from in situ measurements was found to be an order of magnitude lower than that measured on core samples by unconfined strength test in the laboratory. The differences in compressibility for the intact formation are likely due to sample disturbance and the differences in strain level imposed by the field and laboratory methods. The increase in compressibility of the overburden rock varied with the location of the monitoring site relative to longwall extraction and the level of strain the formation sustained. The study found that quantifying the changes in compressibility, and consequently specific storage, as a result of mine-induced disturbance is critical to our understanding of subsidence, the extent of depressurization, and the impact that mining may have on regional groundwater flow systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:25:56","2018-01-19 23:25:56","","304-320","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; Groundwater; in situ measurement; tracking; groundwater flow; hydraulic conductivity; Hydraulic properties; Tides; storage structure; Regional groundwater flow; compressibility; Compressibility; pore pressure; overburden; New South Wales; coal mining; Coal storage; induced response; Loading efficiency; loading test; Longwall coal minings; longwall mining; Mechanical disturbance; Strain; Sydney Basin; Sydney basins; Underground mining; Underground mining operations; underground storage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigates the projected changes in spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts and their future attributes over the Willamette River Basin (WRB) in the Pacific Northwest U.S. The analysis is performed using two subsets of downscaled CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) each consisting of 10 models from two future scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 30 years of historical period (1970–1999) and 90 years of future projections (2010–2099). Hydrologic modeling is conducted using the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) as a robust distributed hydrologic model with lower computational cost compared to other models. Meteorological and hydrological droughts are studied using three drought indices (i.e. Standardized Precipitation Index, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, Standardized Streamflow Index). Results reveal that the intensity and duration of hydrological droughts are expected to increase over the WRB, albeit the annual precipitation is expected to increase. On the other hand, the intensity of meteorological droughts do not indicate an aggravation for most cases. We explore the changes of hydrometeolorogical variables over the basin in order to understand the causes for such differences and to discover the controlling factors of drought. Furthermore, the uncertainty of projections are quantified for model, scenario, and downscaling uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:11","2018-01-19 23:26:11","","785-797","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; drought; hydrological cycle; climate modeling; Standardized precipitation index; Meteorological drought; Drought characteristics; climate change; Pacific Northwest; Drought; PRMS; Willamette; hydrological modeling; Distributed computer systems; Climate models; comparative study; assessment method; global climate; precipitation (climatology); Spatiotemporal characteristics; Oregon; hydrometeorology; Stream flow; index method; CMIP; Distributed hydrologic model; Willamette Basin; temperature effect; Standardized streamflow indices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding its hydro-erosional processes is crucial to assessing, controlling and predicting soil and water losses in this region and maintaining the ecological sustainability of the Yellow River. Simulated rainfall (intensity 90 mm h−1) was used to investigate the runoff and soil loss from loess slopes with different slope gradients (18%, 27%, 36%, 47%, and 58%) and overlying sand layer thicknesses (0, 5 and 10 cm). As compared with uncovered loess slopes, an overlying sand layer delayed runoff production, reduced cumulative runoff and increased cumulative soil loss, as well as enhancing variations among slope gradients. Cumulative runoff and soil loss from the sand-covered loess slopes increased with increasing slope gradients and then slightly decreased, with a peak at about 47% gradient; they both were greater from the 10-cm sand-covered loess slope than from the 5-cm except for with 18% slope gradient. In general, differences in cumulative runoff between sand layer thicknesses became smaller, while those in cumulative soil loss became larger, with increasing slope gradient. Runoff and soil loss rates on the sand-covered loess slopes exhibited unimodal distributions during the rainstorms. Maximum values tended to occur at the same rain duration, and increased considerably with increasing slope gradient and sand layer thickness on slopes that were less than 47%. Liquefaction process might occur on the lower loess slopes covered with thinner sand layers but failures similar to shallow landslides might occur when the sand layer was thicker on steeper slopes. The presence of an overlying sand layer changed the relationship between runoff and soil loss rates during intense rainstorms and this change varied with different slope gradients. Our results demonstrated that the effects of slope gradient on hydro-erosional processes on the sand-covered loess slopes were important and vary with changing sand thickness. These effects should be considered when assessing and predicting soil losses from such slopes in the study region and from similar slopes elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:22","2018-01-19 23:26:22","","447-456","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Runoff; Water resources; rainfall-runoff modeling; Sediments; Erosion; Storms; Soils; landslide; slope failure; soil erosion; wind erosion; Loess Plateau; rainstorm; Sand; Thunderstorms; sand; eolian process; Yellow River; loess; Slope gradients; water erosion; Ecological sustainability; liquefaction; Liquefaction process; Sand layer; Soil and water loss; Soil liquefaction; Soil loss; Unimodal distribution; Water erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water temperature and meteorological observations were obtained in addition to hemispherical photographs along a ∼1 km reach of the Girnock Burn, a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland. Data from nine hemispherical images (representing different uniform canopy density scenarios) were used to parameterise a deterministic net radiation model and simulate radiative fluxes. For each vegetation scenario, the effects of eight channel orientations were investigated by changing the position of north at 45° intervals in each hemispheric image. Simulated radiative fluxes and observed turbulent fluxes drove a high-resolution water temperature model of the reach. Simulations were performed under low and high water velocity scenarios. Both velocity scenarios yielded decreases in mean (≥1.6 °C) and maximum (≥3.0 °C) temperature as canopy density increased. Slow-flowing water resided longer within the reach, which enhanced heat accumulation and dissipation, and drove higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures. Intermediate levels of shade produced highly variable energy flux and water temperature dynamics depending on the channel orientation and thus the time of day when the channel was shaded. We demonstrate that in many reaches relatively sparse but strategically located vegetation could produce substantial reductions in maximum temperature and suggest that these criteria are used to inform future river management. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:33","2018-01-19 23:26:33","","471-485","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom; Vegetation; Temperature; Rivers; energy flux; Forestry; Budget control; Stream temperatures; water temperature; land use change; Flow velocity; Dynamics; stream; Land-use change; riparian vegetation; Riparian vegetation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; river management; river channel; River temperature; Produced Water; riparian forest; Riparian forests; Scotland; Velocity; flow velocity; energy budget; Aberdeenshire; Energy budgets; Girnock Burn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Merrimack River watershed, the fourth largest basin in New England, with a drainage area of 13,000 km2, is a compelling study site because it not only provides an opportunity to investigate the teleconnection between hydrologic variables and large-scale climate circulation patterns, but also how those patterns may become obscured by anthropogenic disturbances such as river regulation or urban development.

The discharge anomalies were statistically significant (p-value ≤ 0.2) between extreme positive and negative phases of AMO (1857–2011) and NAO (1900–2011) and revealed the potential teleconnectivity of climate circulation patterns with discharge. Annual and seasonal correlations of discharge were examined with the extreme phases of AMO and NAO at zero-, one-, or two- year/season lags (total of 30 scenarios). When AMO was greater than 0.2, the strongest correlations of AMO and NAO with discharge were observed at headwater catchments. This correlation weakened downstream towards larger regulated and/or developed sub-basins. We introduced a simple approach for near-term prediction of drought and flooding events. An exponential decay function was regressed through the historic occurrence of the relative frequency of wet, average, and dry discharge conditions with regards to the extreme phases of AMO and NAO. While the function was decaying, the tail asymptotically merged into and stabilized at the theoretical probability of the event. As the basin scale increased, the probability of wet, average, and dry discharge conditions decreased. The Merrimack River watershed will most likely experience greater than average discharge as its extreme condition, therefore development should be avoided on flood plains. Furthermore, the current reservoir storage capacity in the Merrimack should be improved in order to accommodate excess water input and minimize flood damage. Future research should target changes in the magnitude and timing of high discharge events in order to develop adaptation strategies for aging hydraulic infrastructure in the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:43","2018-01-19 23:26:43","","130-141","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; North Atlantic Oscillation; Oceanography; United States; discharge; drought; Drought; Rivers; Floods; flooding; Forecasting; anthropogenic effect; watershed; seasonal variation; Watersheds; floodplain; Catchments; Sea level; Digital storage; Surface waters; precipitation (climatology); urban development; Reservoirs (water); Urban growth; Atmospheric pressure; Pacific Ocean; headwater; Extreme discharges; Extreme phases of AMO and NAO; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; Merrimack River; New Hampshire; Northeastern United States; Teleconnection patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in freshwater was evaluated, through the use of a recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte-Carlo-based technique, based on faecal indicator bacteria measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM3-PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of faecal indicator bacteria is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens. The “managed ecosystems” scenario proposed in this study can cause a reduction of 15% in average water faecal indicator bacteria and up to 30% in the 90th percentile of water faecal indicator bacteria, mainly due to the conversion of pasture land into grassland and the expansion of forest land. This study provides an example of how to assess the impacts of human interventions on the landscape, and what may be the extent of their effects, for other catchments where the human use of the natural resources in the uplands can jeopardise the use of natural resources downstream. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:26:54","2018-01-19 23:26:54","","248-261","","","553","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate projection; Runoff; United Kingdom; Water quality; Water resources; catchment; river flow; seasonality; climate change; Monte Carlo methods; water quality; Ecology; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Land use; Water pollution; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Potable water; Catchments; Forestry; Bacteria; bioindicator; fecal coliform; Pathogens; land use change; Bacteria (microorganisms); Water quality modelling; River pollution; Water-borne pathogens; Land-use change; Effluents; Agricultural intensification; temperate environment; Sewage; Conwy; Conwy River; Faecal indicator bacteria; Harvesting activities; Increased temperature; Natural resources; Shellfish; Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous impact assessments of dam regulation on flow regimes have focused on long-term average patterns, but interannual variations, which are important characteristics to be considered, have been ignored. In this study, the entire signatures of hydrograph variations of Miyun Reservoir in northern China were described by forty flow regime metrics that incorporate magnitude, variability and frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change for flow events based on a long-term synchronous observation series of inflow and outflow. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to reduce the multidimensionality of the metrics and time and to determine impact patterns and their interannual shifts. Statistically significant driving factors of impact pattern variations were identified. We found that dam regulation resulted in four main impact classes on the flow regimes and that the regulated capacity was interannually attenuated from 1973 to 2010. The impact patterns alternated between the highly regulated class with extremely decreasing flow magnitude, slight variability, and extreme intermittency and the slightly regulated class with extremely increasing flow magnitude, slight variability, and extreme intermittency from 1973 to 1987 and then stabilized in the latter class from 1988 to 2001. After 2001, the pattern gradually changed from the moderately regulated class with moderately decreasing flow magnitude, extreme variability, and extreme intermittency to the slightly regulated class with slightly decreasing flow magnitude, slight variability, and no intermittency. Decreasing precipitation and increasing drought were the primary drivers for the interannual variations of the impact patterns, and inflow variability was the most significant factor affecting the patterns, followed by flow event frequency and duration, magnitude, and timing. This study shows that the use of interannual characteristics can help to gain more insight into the impact of dam regulation on flow regimes and will provide important information to scientifically guide the multi-purpose regulation of dams. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:27:15","2018-01-19 23:27:15","","447-459","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Principal component analysis; China; Dams; classification; cluster analysis; reservoir; flow pattern; policy making; hydrodynamics; water flow; Human resource management; flow measurement; hydrograph; Cluster analysis; annual variation; Impact assessments; principal component analysis; dam; Interannual variation; Beijing [China]; magnitude; Comprehensive assessment; Flow observation; Miyun Reservoir; Multidimensionality; Resource management; Synchronous observations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture geophysical retrieval products from passive L-band radiometer to evaluate its applicability to forming agricultural drought indices. Agricultural drought is quantified using the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) based on SMAP and soil properties (field capacity and available water content) information. The soil properties are computed using pedo-transfer function with soil characteristics derived from Harmonized World Soil Database. The SMAP soil moisture product needs to be rescaled to be compatible with the soil parameters derived from the in situ stations. In most locations, the rescaled SMAP information captured the dynamics of in situ soil moisture well and shows the expected lag between accumulations of precipitation and delayed increased in surface soil moisture. However, the SMAP soil moisture itself does not reveal the drought information. Therefore, the SMAP based SWDI (SMAP_SWDI) was computed to improve agriculture drought monitoring by using the latest soil moisture retrieval satellite technology. The formulation of SWDI does not depend on longer data and it will overcome the limited (short) length of SMAP data for agricultural drought studies. The SMAP_SWDI is further compared with in situ Atmospheric Water Deficit (AWD) Index. The comparison shows close agreement between SMAP_SWDI and AWD in drought monitoring over Contiguous United States (CONUS), especially in terms of drought characteristics. The SMAP_SWDI was used to construct drought maps for CONUS and compared with well-known drought indices, such as, AWD, Palmer Z-Index, sc-PDSI and SPEI. Overall the SMAP_SWDI is an effective agricultural drought indicator and it provides continuity and introduces new spatial mapping capability for drought monitoring. As an agricultural drought index, SMAP_SWDI has potential to capture short term moisture information similar to AWD and related drought indices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:27:24","2018-01-19 23:27:24","","620-632","","","552","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water resources; database; drought; satellite data; soil moisture; Drought characteristics; Drought; parameterization; computer simulation; Agriculture; Soil moisture; Soils; Plants (botany); estimation method; Soil surveys; monitoring system; Moisture; Moisture control; radiometer; Available water contents; Soil moisture deficits; Soil moisture retrievals; Pedo-transfer functions; SMAP; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); SWDI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:27:35","2018-01-19 23:27:35","","660-673","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; China; Runoff; Water quality; optimization; hydrological modeling; Agriculture; integrated approach; runoff; watershed; multicriteria analysis; calibration; Watersheds; nitrogen; Nitrogen; environmental impact assessment; fertilizer application; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizers; Farms; Orchards; Reforestation; Eutrophication; Jiangxi; agricultural practice; paddy field; Agricultural runoff; Waterworks; shrub; Experimental watersheds; Multi-objective calibration; Water system; Agricultural management practice; agricultural runoff; Diffuse nitrogen; environmental quality; Nitrogen fertilizers; Qianyanzhou; Regional characteristics; sowing; Stereo image processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, the perturbing ensemble is sampled from one prescribed multivariate normal distribution (MND). However, MND is under-represented in capturing the non-MND uncertainties caused by the nonlinear integration of land surface models while these hypernormal uncertainties can be better characterized by generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) which takes MND as the special case. In this paper, one novel GGD based uncertainty sampling approach is outlined to create one hypernormal ensemble for the purpose of better improving land surface models with observation. With this sampling method, various assimilation methods can be tested in a common equation form. Experimental results on Noah LSM show that the outlined method is more powerful than MND in reducing the misfit between model forecasts and observations in terms of actual evapotranspiration, skin temperature, and soil moisture/ temperature in the 1st layer, and also indicate that the energy and water balances constrain ensemble based assimilation to simultaneously optimize all state and diagnostic variables. Overall evaluation expounds that the outlined approach is a better alternative than the traditional MND method for seizing assimilation uncertainties, and it can serve as a useful tool for optimizing hydrological models with data assimilation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:27:47","2018-01-19 23:27:47","","745-764","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; equation; evapotranspiration; optimization; data assimilation; Normal distribution; hydrological modeling; Surface measurement; Data assimilation; uncertainty analysis; sampling; Gaussian method; ensemble forecasting; Actual evapotranspiration; Gaussian distribution; Energy and water balance; Generalized Gaussian distribution; Generalized Gaussian Distributions; Multi-variate normal distributions; Nonlinear integration; Uncertainty samplings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the availability of this data is usually short. Nevertheless a precipitation model could be used to tackle this shortcoming; therefore it is in the aim of this study to present a stochastic point precipitation model to reproduce average rainfall event properties along with extreme values. For this purpose a model is proposed to generate long synthetic series of rainfall for a temporal resolution of 5 min. It is based on an alternating renewal framework and events are characterized by variables describing durations, amounts and peaks. A group of 24 stations located in the north of Germany is used to set up and test the model. The adequate modeling of joint behaviour of rainfall amount and duration is found to be essential for reproducing the observed properties, especially for the extreme events. Copulas are advantageous tools for modeling these variables jointly; however caution must be taken in the selection of the proper copula. The inclusion of seasonality and small events is as well tested and found to be useful. The model is directly validated by generating long synthetic time series and comparing them with observed ones. An indirect validation is as well performed based on a fictional urban hydrological system. The proposed model is capable of reproducing seasonal behaviour and main characteristics of the rainfall events including extremes along with urban flooding and overflow behaviour. Overall the performance of the model is acceptable compared to the design practice. The proposed model is simple to interpret, fast to implement and to transfer to other regions, whilst showing acceptable results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:27:57","2018-01-19 23:27:57","","182-197","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Rain; rainfall; simulation; time series analysis; seasonality; hydrological modeling; flooding; model validation; Precipitation (meteorology); urban drainage; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; extreme event; stochasticity; precipitation (climatology); Extreme events; Continuous simulation; High temporal resolution; Copulas; Point precipitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we provide an inverse procedure for estimating these ICs. The procedure is based on an adaptive parameterization of the ICs that limits over-parameterization and involves the minimization of an ad hoc objective function. The quasi-Newton algorithm is used for the minimization, and the gradients are computed with an adjoint-state method. Two test cases based on a real aquifer that are designed to evaluate the capability of the method were addressed. It is assumed that the boundary conditions, hydraulic parameters and forcing terms are known from an existing hydrogeological model. In both test cases, the proposed method was quite successful in estimating the ICs and predicting head values that were not used in the calibration. 50 calibrations for each test case have been performed to quantify the reliability of the predictions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:28:08","2018-01-19 23:28:08","","52-61","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; algorithm; prediction; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; parameterization; Forecasting; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; calibration; groundwater flow; Parameterization; flow modeling; hydraulic conductivity; Hydraulic parameters; Hydrogeological models; Initial conditions; Inverse problems; Groundwater Flow Model; Boundary conditions; Adaptive parameterization; Integrated circuits; Inverse methods; Parameterizations; Quasi-newton algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This heterogeneity is currently poorly represented by gauging networks and by the coarse scale of global and regional climate and hydrological models. Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) are found in a narrow elevation range and are characterized by persistent fog. Their water balance depends on local and upwind temperatures and moisture, therefore, changes in these parameters will alter TMCF hydrology. Until recently the hydrological functioning of TMCFs was mainly studied in coastal regions, while continental TMCFs were largely ignored. This study contributes to fill this gap by focusing on a TMCF which is located on the northern eastern Andes at an elevation of 1550–2300 m asl, in the Orinoco river basin highlands. In this study, we describe the spatial and seasonal meteorological variability, analyse the corresponding catchment hydrological response to different land cover, and perform a sensitivity analysis on uncertainties related to rainfall interpolation, catchment area estimation and streamflow measurements. Hydro-meteorological measurements, including hourly solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow, were collected from June 2013 to May 2014 at three gauged neighbouring catchments with contrasting TMCF/grassland cover and less than 250 m elevation difference. We found wetter and less seasonally contrasting conditions at higher elevations, indicating a positive relation between elevation and fog or rainfall persistence. This pattern is similar to that of other eastern Andean TMCFs, however, the study site had higher wet season rainfall and lower dry season rainfall suggesting that upwind contrasts in land cover and moisture can influence the meteorological conditions at eastern Andean TMCFs. Contrasting streamflow dynamics between the studied catchments reflect the overall system response as a function of the catchments’ elevation and land cover. The forested catchment, located at the higher elevations, had the highest seasonal streamflows. During the wet season, different land covers at the lower elevations were important in defining the streamflow responses between the deforested catchment and the catchment with intermediate forest cover. Streamflows were higher and the rainfall-runoff responses were faster in the deforested catchment than in the intermediate forest cover catchment. During the dry season, the catchments’ elevation defined streamflows due to higher water inputs and lower evaporative demand at the higher elevations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:28:19","2018-01-19 23:28:19","","151-167","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; Water balance; regional climate; tropical forest; Drought; Uncertainty analysis; heterogeneity; Climate models; Watersheds; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Forestry; Hydrology; river basin; Soil moisture; hydrological response; hydrometeorology; water budget; River basins; Stream flow; Moisture; forest cover; Andes; Elevation gradient; Tropics; montane forest; Streamflow uncertainty; Orinoco Basin; Tropical montane cloud forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyzes 1576 rainfall-runoff-soil loss events at 36 experimental plots (a total of 148 plot-years of data) under a wide range of conditions in subtropical mountainous areas of China where slope farming is commonly practiced. The plots, which have standardized dimensions, represent five common types of land use and have four different slopes. Event-based analyses show that almost half of the total rainfall caused soil erosion in the study area. The dominant factor controlling the runoff coefficient is the slope gradient rather than the land use type. The maximum soil lossfor crop plots under steep tillage (35°) is 5004 t km−2 for a single event. Among the common local crops, the average soil loss values increase in the following order: buckwheat &lt; mung bean &lt; sesame.

Estimating total water storage has shown to be highly useful in detecting hydrological variations and trends. However, a limitation is that GRACE does not provide information as to where the water is stored in the vertical profile.

In situ water level observations are sequentially assimilated to correct both water level and discharge. The stochastic estimation of the background error statistics is achieved over an ensemble of MASCARET integrations with perturbed hydrological boundary conditions. It is shown that the geometric characteristics of the network as well as the hydrological forcings and their temporal variability have a significant impact on the shape of the univariate (water level) and multivariate (water level and discharge) background error covariance functions and thus on the EnKF analysis. The performance of the EnKF algorithm is examined for observing system simulation experiments as well as for a set of eight real flood events (2009–2014). The quality of the ensemble is deemed satisfactory as long as the forecast lead time remains under the transfer time of the network, when perfect hydrological forcings are considered. Results demonstrate that the simulated hydraulic state variables can be improved over the entire network, even where no data are available, with a limited ensemble size and thus a computational cost compatible with operational constraints.

The dependence on groundwater increases in those areas with predominant permeable lithologies, contributing to aquifer recharge and the abundance of ephemeral streams. The increasing pressure of tourism on water resources in many Mediterranean coastal areas, and uncertainty related to future precipitation and water availability, make it urgent to understand the spatio-temporal response of groundwater bodies to precipitation variability, if sustainable use of the resource is to be achieved. We present an assessment of the response of aquifers to precipitation variability based on correlations between the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at various time scales and the Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI) across a Mediterranean island. We detected three main responses of aquifers to accumulated precipitation anomalies: (i) at short time scales of the SPI (<6 months); (ii) at medium time scales (6–24 months); and at long time scales (>24 months). The differing responses were mainly explained by differences in lithology and the percentage of highly permeable rock strata in the aquifer recharge areas. We also identified differences in the months and seasons when aquifer storages are more dependent on precipitation; these were related to climate seasonality and the degree of aquifer exploitation or underground water extraction. The recharge of some aquifers, especially in mountainous areas, is related to precipitation variability within a limited spatial extent, whereas for aquifers located in the plains, precipitation variability influence much larger areas; the topography and geological structure of the island explain these differences. Results indicate large spatial variability in the response of aquifers to precipitation in a very small area, highlighting the importance of having high spatial resolution hydro-climatic databases available to enable full understanding of the effects of climate variability on scarce water resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:29:40","2018-01-19 23:29:40","","516-531","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; drought; Climatology; Standardized precipitation index; Spain; Mediterranean Sea; Hydrogeology; seasonality; water management; Drought; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; disaster management; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation assessment; water level; precipitation (climatology); recharge; Time measurement; Stream flow; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean climates; Mediterranean environment; groundwater resource; index method; Recharging (underground waters); Lithology; Precipitation anomalies; climate conditions; High spatial resolution; lithology; Precipitation variability; exploitation; Balearic Islands; island; Majorca; Mallorca; Standardized Groundwater Index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is thus useful to have a correct understanding of the soil water-salt dynamics and plant water use for keeping the sustainability of those natural areas. The HYDRUS-dualKc model that couples the HYDRUS-1D model with the FAO-56 dualKc approach was extended to simulate the eco-hydrological processes in natural patches of Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao), upper Yellow River basin. Field experiments were conducted in a tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis Lour.) dominated area during the growing seasons of 2012 and 2013. The model was calibrated and validated using the two-year experimental data, and applied to analyze the water and salt dynamics and the tamarisk water consumption for the present situation. Then, various groundwater depth (i.e. the depth from groundwater surface to water table, GWD) scenarios were simulated while considering the fluctuating and constant regimes of GWD changes, as well as variations of the rooting depth. Results indicated that this natural land functioned efficiently as a drainage area for subsurface flow and excess salt from surrounding croplands. However, the present GWDs were too shallow leading to high soil evaporation and severe salt stress. The soil evaporation accounted for 50% of the total evapotranspiration (ETa) while root zone salt storage increased about 50% during growing seasons. On the basis of scenario analysis, an optimum groundwater depth of 140–200 cm with smaller fluctuation was suggested for the growing seasons of natural patches. In addition, tamarisk growth could be largely improved if the roots can grow deeper with water table decline in the future. We demonstrated that monitoring and modeling could be used to support the development of water management strategies in Hetao aimed at conserving water while sustaining local ecosystems. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:29:50","2018-01-19 23:29:50","","490-504","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; Vegetation; Water management; evaporation; evapotranspiration; groundwater; sustainability; ecohydrology; irrigation; water management; Ecology; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Ecosystems; Biodiversity; Watersheds; Water supply; ecosystem function; Water conservation; Soil moisture; Soils; Digital storage; Salinity; Sustainable development; agricultural land; agricultural ecosystem; Ground water depths; water uptake; salt; Yellow River Basin; Natural vegetation; Eco-hydrological models; Evaporation; shrub; water depth; Agro ecosystems; Hetao; Nei Monggol; patch dynamics; Tamaricaceae; Tamarix chinensis; vegetation structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, based on the annual rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration data series from 1970 to 2013 in the Luhun irrigation district of China, the joint probability distribution of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration are developed with the Frank copula function. Using the joint probability distribution, the synchronous-asynchronous encounter risk, conditional joint probability, and conditional return period of different combinations of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration are analyzed. The results show that the copula-based joint probability distributions of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration are reasonable. The asynchronous encounter probability of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration is greater than their synchronous encounter probability, and the water shortage risk associated with meteorological drought (i.e. rainfall variability) is more prone to appear. Compared with other states, there are higher conditional joint probability and lower conditional return period in either low rainfall or high reference crop evapotranspiration. For a specifically high reference crop evapotranspiration with a certain frequency, the encounter risk of low rainfall and high reference crop evapotranspiration is increased with the decrease in frequency. For a specifically low rainfall with a certain frequency, the encounter risk of low rainfall and high reference crop evapotranspiration is decreased with the decrease in frequency.

The model is a modified version of the original model developed by Kirchner in 2009 which uses a unique sensitivity function, g(Q) to represent the relation between rate of flow recession and the instantaneous flow rate. The modified dynamic model instead uses a normalized sensitivity function g(Qnorm) which provides the model the flexibility to encompass the hysteretic effect of initial water storage on flow during recession periods. The sensitivity function is normalized based on a correlation function F(Q) which implicitly quantifies the influence of initial storage conditions on recession flow dynamics. For periods of either positive or negative net recharge to groundwater the model applies a term similar in form to an analytical solution based on solution to the linearized Boussinesq equation. The combination of these two streamflow components, the recession component and the net recharge response, provides the model with the flexibility to realistically mimic the hysteresis in the Q vs. S relations for a watershed. The model is applied to the Sagehen Creek watershed, a hilly watershed located in the Sierra Mountains of California.

In the proposed approach, we use the spatially lumped catchment model StreamGEM to predict daily stream flow and nitrate concentration (mg L−1 NO3-N) in four contrasting mesoscale headwater catchments based on four years of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and stream flow measurements, and monthly or daily nitrate concentrations. Posterior model parameter distributions were estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling code DREAMZS and a log-likelihood function assuming heteroscedastic, t-distributed residuals. Despite high uncertainty in some model parameters, the flow and nitrate calibration data was well reproduced across all catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency against Log transformed data, NSL, in the range 0.62–0.83 for daily flow and 0.17–0.88 for nitrate concentration). The slight increase in the size of the residuals for a separate validation period was considered acceptable (NSL in the range 0.60–0.89 for daily flow and 0.10–0.74 for nitrate concentration, excluding one data set with limited validation data). Proportions of flow and nitrate discharge attributed to near-surface, fast seasonal groundwater and slow deeper groundwater were consistent with expectations based on catchment geology. The results for the Weida Stream in Thuringia, Germany, using monthly as opposed to daily nitrate data were, for all intents and purposes, identical, suggesting that four years of monthly nitrate sampling provides sufficient information for calibration of the StreamGEM model and prediction of catchment dynamics. This study highlights the remarkable effectiveness of process based, spatially lumped modelling with commonly available monthly stream sample data, to elucidate high resolution catchment function, when appropriate calibration methods are used that correctly handle the inherent uncertainties. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:30:22","2018-01-19 23:30:22","","684-703","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Germany; Runoff; Water quality; potential evapotranspiration; streamflow; Uncertainty; data set; Monte Carlo methods; water quality; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian analysis; Forecasting; Groundwater; nitrate; runoff; calibration; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Nitrates; hydrograph; Markov processes; Ground water discharge; Nutrients; Stream flow; Potential evapotranspiration; Thuringia; headwater; DREAM; Flow hydrograph; Log-likelihood functions; Lumped parameter networks; Markov chain monte carlo samplings; Modeling and predictions; Weida River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many studies have analysed annual-maximum flow trends but few have quantified changes in major (25–100 year return period) floods, i.e. those that have the greatest societal impacts. Existing major-flood studies used a limited number of very large catchments affected to varying degrees by alterations such as reservoirs and urbanisation. In the current study, trends in major-flood occurrence from 1961 to 2010 and from 1931 to 2010 were assessed using a very large dataset (>1200 gauges) of diverse catchments from North America and Europe; only minimally altered catchments were used, to focus on climate-driven changes rather than changes due to catchment alterations. Trend testing of major floods was based on counting the number of exceedances of a given flood threshold within a group of gauges. Evidence for significant trends varied between groups of gauges that were defined by catchment size, location, climate, flood threshold and period of record, indicating that generalizations about flood trends across large domains or a diversity of catchment types are ungrounded. Overall, the number of significant trends in major-flood occurrence across North America and Europe was approximately the number expected due to chance alone. Changes over time in the occurrence of major floods were dominated by multidecadal variability rather than by long-term trends. There were more than three times as many significant relationships between major-flood occurrence and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation than significant long-term trends. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:30:46","2018-01-19 23:30:46","","704-717","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Climate change; Europe; Runoff; catchment; gauge; urbanization; data set; climate change; North America; Climate variability; Floods; flooding; Catchments; flood; Reservoirs (water); Gages; Anthropogenic climate changes; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Potential impacts; Trends; Annual maximum flow; Multidecadal variability; Societal impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective was to evaluate whether field-based monitoring can allow for the improvement of the accuracy in SWCCs estimation with respect to the use of laboratory techniques. Moreover, field assessment of SWCCs allowed to: a) quantify the hydrological hysteresis affecting SWCCs through field data; b) analyze the effect of different temporal resolution of field measures; c) highlight the differences in SWCCs reconstructed for a particular soil during different hydrological years; d) evaluate the reliability of field reconstructed SWCCs, by the comparison between assessed and measured trends of a component of the soil water balance. These aspects were fundamental for assessing the reliability of the field reconstructed SWCCs. Field data at two Italian test-sites were measured. These test-sites were used to evaluate the goodness of field reconstructed SWCCs for soils characterized by different geomorphological, geological, physical and pedological features. Field measured or laboratory measured SWCCs data of 5 soil horizons (3 in a predominantly silty soil, 2 in a predominantly clayey one) were fitted by Van Genuchten model. Different field drying and wetting periods were identified, based on monthly meteorological conditions, in terms of rainfall and evapotranspiration amounts, of different cycles. This method allowed for a correct discrimination of the main drying and the main wetting paths from field data related and for a more reliable quantification of soil hydrological properties with respect to laboratory methodologies. Particular patterns of changes in SWCCs forms along depth could be also identified. Field SWCCs estimation is not affected by the temporal resolution of the acquisition (hours or days), as testified by similar values of Van Genuchten equation fitting parameters. Instead, hourly data may offer a clearer vision of the drying and wetting paths, due to the highest number of experimental data points. Moreover, in temperate climate situations as those of the test-sites, main drying curves and main wetting curves of a particular soil were substantially similar also for different hydrological cycles with peculiar meteorological conditions. SWCCs parameters were implemented in a numerical code (HYDRUS-1D) to simulate soil water storage for different soil horizons. Field reconstructed SWCCs allowed for simulating with a higher precision these trends, confirming the reliability of the reconstructed field curves by a quantitative point of view. Moreover, best results were obtained considering hysteresis in the modeling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:30:58","2018-01-19 23:30:58","","283-305","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; data set; temporal analysis; water content; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; water storage; Digital storage; estimation method; Soil surveys; Monitoring; monitoring; Reliability; Hydrological cycles; Laboratories; laboratory method; Soil testing; Meteorological condition; Hysteresis; Wetting; porewater; hysteresis; Drying; Soil water storage; Field monitoring data; Field-based monitoring; Laboratory techniques; soil horizon; Soil hydrological properties; Soil-water characteristic curve; wetting-drying cycle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an important water ecosystem index, environmental flows (e-flows) are crucial for maintaining sustainability. However, most e-flow measurement methods involve long cycles, low efficiency, and transdisciplinary expertise. This makes it impossible to rapidly assess river e-flows at basin or larger scales. This study presents a new method to rapidly assessing e-flows coupling UAV and ground monitorings. UAV was firstly used to calculate river-course cross-sections with high-resolution stereoscopic images. A dominance index was then used to identify key fish species. Afterwards a habitat suitability index, along with biodiversity and integrity indices, was used to determine an appropriate flow velocity with full consideration of the fish spawning period. The cross-sections and flow velocity values were then combined into AEHRA, an e-flow assessment method for studying e-flows and supplying-rate. To verify the results from this new method, the widely used Tennant method was employed. The root-mean-square errors of river cross-sections determined by UAV are less than 0.25 m, which constitutes 3–5% water-depth of the river cross-sections. In the study area of Jinan city, the ecological flow velocity (VE) is equal to or greater than 0.11 m/s, and the ecological water depth (HE) is greater than 0.8 m. The river ecosystem is healthy with the minimum e-flow requirements being always met when it is close to large rivers, which is beneficial for the sustainable development of the water ecosystem. In the south river channel of Jinan, the upstream flow mostly meets the minimum e-flow requirements, and the downstream flow always meets the minimum e-flow requirements. The north of Jinan consists predominantly of artificial river channels used for irrigation. Rainfall rarely meets the minimum e-flow and irrigation water requirements. We suggest that the water shortage problem can be partly solved by diversion of the Yellow River. These results can provide useful information for ecological operations and restoration. The method used in this study for calculating e-flow based on a combination of UAV and ground monitoring can effectively promote research progress into basin e-flow, and provide an important reference for e-flow monitoring around the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:31:11","2018-01-19 23:31:11","","351-365","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; river flow; Hydrogeology; Fish; Ecology; Environmental flow; Rivers; Ecosystems; Aquatic ecosystems; biodiversity; Biodiversity; Water supply; assessment method; environmental monitoring; flow measurement; Irrigation; human activity; Root mean square errors; sustainable development; Sustainable development; Flow velocity; Stream flow; river channel; basin analysis; River diversion; fish; flow velocity; Yellow River; Shandong; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); unmanned vehicle; Stereo image processing; dominance; Fish communities; Flow measurement methods; Habitat suitability index; Integrity indices; Irrigation water requirements; Jinan [Shandong]; Stereoscopic image","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate and mitigate the environmental risks of this phenomenon it is necessary to characterize the coastal aquifer and the salt intrusion. Geophysical methods are the most appropriate tool to address these researches. Among all geophysical techniques, electrical methods are able to detect seawater intrusions due to the high resistivity contrast between saltwater, freshwater and geological layers. The combination of two or more geophysical methods is recommended and they are more efficient when both data are inverted jointly because the final model encompasses the physical properties measured for each methods. In this investigation, joint inversion of vertical electric and time domain soundings has been performed to examine seawater intrusion in an area within the Ferragudo-Albufeira aquifer system (Algarve, South of Portugal). For this purpose two profiles combining electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) methods were measured and the results were compared with the information obtained from exploration drilling. Three different inversions have been carried out: single inversion of the ERT and TDEM data, 1D joint inversion and quasi-2D joint inversion. Single inversion results identify seawater intrusion, although the sedimentary layers detected in exploration drilling were not well differentiated. The models obtained with 1D joint inversion improve the previous inversion due to better detection of sedimentary layer and the seawater intrusion appear to be better defined. Finally, the quasi-2D joint inversion reveals a more realistic shape of the seawater intrusion and it is able to distinguish more sedimentary layers recognised in the exploration drilling. This study demonstrates that the quasi-2D joint inversion improves the previous inversions methods making it a powerful tool applicable to different research areas. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:31:22","2018-01-19 23:31:22","","609-619","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Portugal; performance assessment; Hydrogeology; climate change; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Geophysics; Sea level; sea level change; extreme event; Groundwater geochemistry; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; tomography; coastal aquifer; Time domain analysis; Sedimentology; Groundwater depletion; electromagnetic method; Intrusion detection; Coastal aquifers; Algarve; coast; drilling; Electric prospecting; Exploration drilling; Geophysical techniques; Joint inversion; Lateral constrained; Time domain electromagnetic methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Determining the matrix infiltration process is important in partitioning water infiltrating into the soil through the soil body and macropores to evaluate the effects of soil and water conservation practices on hillslope hydrology and watershed sedimentation. A new method that employs a double-ring infiltrometer was applied in this study to determine the matrix infiltration process in forest soil. Field experiments were conducted in a forest field on the Loess Plateau at Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station. Nylon cloth was placed on the soil surface in the inner ring and between the inner and outer rings of infiltrometers. A thin layer of fine sands were placed onto the nylon cloth to shelter the macropores and ensure that water infiltrates the soil through the matrix only. Brilliant Blue tracers were applied to examine the exclusion of preferential flow occurrences in the measured soil body. The infiltration process was measured, computed, and recorded through procedures similar to those of conventional methods. Horizontal and vertical soil profiles were excavated to check the success of the experiment and ensure that preferential flow did not occur in the measured soil column and that infiltration was only through the soil matrix. The infiltration processes of the replicates of five plots were roughly the same, thereby indicating the feasibility of the methodology to measure soil matrix infiltration. The measured infiltration curves effectively explained the transient process of soil matrix infiltration. Philip and Kostiakov models fitted the measured data well, and all the coefficients of determination were greater than 0.9. The wetted soil bodies through excavations did not present evidence of preferential flow. Therefore, the proposed method can determine the infiltration process through the forest soil matrix. This method can also be applied to explore matrix infiltration in other land-use types. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:31:34","2018-01-19 23:31:34","","241-248","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; methodology; Groundwater flow; preferential flow; Preferential flows; matrix; numerical method; infiltration; Water conservation; experimental study; Forestry; soil water; Soils; hillslope; Soil surveys; Soil conservation; Conventional methods; Infiltration; soil surface; Loess Plateau; Gansu; soil column; Soil and water conservation; forest soil; soil profile; Infiltration process; Experimental stations; Forest soils; infiltrometer; Infiltrometers; Matrix infiltration; Polyamides; Rayon; Tianshui","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only a few isotope studies have been conducted on a large scale and rarely over long time periods. The objective of this study was to identify the spatial and seasonal variability of isotopic composition in river water and how it is affected by geographical and hydrological factors. The stable isotopic composition of river water has been measured in nine large river catchments in Germany for a time period of 12 years or 26 years. We conducted time series and correlation analyses to identify spatial and temporal patterns of the isotopic composition in the rivers. Further, we compared it to isotopic composition in local precipitation and catchments characteristics. In the majority of the rivers, the spatial and temporal patterns of precipitation were directly reflected in river water. The isotopic signals of the river water were time shifted and show attenuated amplitudes. Further deviations from isotopic compositions in local precipitation were observed in catchments with complex flow systems. These deviations were attributed to catchment processes and influences like evaporation, damming and storage. The seasonality of the isotopic composition was mainly determined by the discharge regimes of the rivers. We found correlations between isotopic long-term averages and catchment altitude as well as latitude and longitude, resulting in a northwest-southeast gradient. Furthermore, it was shown that long-term averages of d-excess were inversely related to flow length and catchment size, which indicates that evaporation enrichment has an impact on the isotopic composition even in catchments of humid climates. This study showed that isotopic composition in rivers can serve as a proxy for the local precipitation and can be utilized as an indicator for hydrological processes even in large river basins. In future, such long time series will help to also understand the impact of changes in the hydrological cycle on the larger scales. They can also be used for calibration and validation of flow and transport models at catchment and sub-catchment scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:31:45","2018-01-19 23:31:45","","718-731","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Runoff; Time series; Time series analysis; Water resources; catchment; hydrological cycle; data set; time series analysis; Rivers; hydrological modeling; calibration; Watersheds; model validation; Catchments; river basin; Digital storage; river water; Calibration and validations; Spatial and temporal patterns; Isotopes; stable isotope; Water stable isotopes; isotopic composition; deuterium; Deuterium; Evaporation; oxygen isotope; long-term change; Stable isotopic compositions; Deuterium excess; Hydrological factors; Large rivers; Long-term data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SWC was measured weekly from May to August 2013 in the 0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–50 cm layers. SWC was more variable in the surface soil, due to several environmental factors, and the variability gradually decreased with depth. A large sample size was needed for estimating the mean SWC of the field under dry conditions. High Spearman correlation coefficients between the SWCs measured on different sampling campaigns indicated a high temporal stability. The stability of the SWC spatial patterns over time and along the soil profile allowed us to identify a location representative of the field-mean SWC, with high coefficients of determination ranging between 0.8564 and 0.9325.

The principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to SPI time series to identify spatial and temporal drought patterns. SPI time series are classified into two groups (1st group: SPI-1, SPI-3, SPI-6AS; and 2nd group: SPI-6 and SPI-12) according to the similarity in spatial drought patterns. SPI-3 and SPI-12 are selected as representative members of each group for spatio-temporal analysis. A relationship among correlation area (An), correlation coefficient (CC), principle component numbers (Fn) and total variances explained (Vexp) are investigated for identifying four well-defined drought vulnerable homogeneous regions over Turkey mainland. Mean percentages of extreme, severe, and moderate drought areas are calculated as 3.13% (2.81%), 3.75% (4.06%) and 7.19% (7.50%) for SPI-3 (SPI-12) based on 80 years in all drought vulnerable regions. Spectral characteristics of drought are also investigated based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. It is observed that while southeastern and western parts of Turkey are more stable due to the highly-correlated variances of spatial patterns; central parts and few pockets in northern areas of Turkey are less stable regions because of the low-correlated variance scores (below 10%).

In this study, a multi-objective operation model for TGR considering these two functions was developed. Since the optimal results of reservoir operation are mostly in the form of gross outflow which is hardly used to directly guide reservoir operation, the optimization of spillways operation was taken into account. For observed historical flood hydrographs and design flood hydrographs, the progressive optimality algorithm (POA) was employed to determine the optimal operation of spillways. For the real-time reservoir operation, a smooth support vector machine (SSVM) model was applied to abstract the optimal operation rules which consider the order and the number of spillways put into use. Results demonstrate that the use of different spillways has a significant impact on reservoir operation. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the order and number of spillways that should be used. Instead of optimizing outflow, direct optimization of the order and number of spillways can yield most reasonable results. The SSVM model simulates the relationship among inflow, water level and outflow satisfactorily and can be used for real-time or short term reservoir operation. Application of the SSVM model can also reduce flood risk and increase hydropower generation during the flood season. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:32:18","2018-01-19 23:32:18","","554-563","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Reservoir operation; algorithm; optimization; Multiobjective optimization; Floods; Flood control; Support vector machines; flood control; Water levels; water level; Reservoirs (water); support vector machine; Hydro-power generation; design flood; Hydroelectric power; Optimal operation; Three gorges reservoir; Three Gorges Reservoir; Historical floods; reservoir flooding; Progressive optimality algorithm; Direct optimization; Smooth support vector machine; spillway; Spillways","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This uncertainty is often attributed to the use of empirical hydraulic formulae (the one-dimensional (1D) weir and orifice steady flow equations) to achieve data-connectivity at the linking interface, which require the determination of discharge coefficients. Because of the paucity of high resolution localised data for this type of flows, the current understanding and quantification of a suitable range for those discharge coefficients is somewhat lacking. To fulfil this gap, this work presents the results acquired from an instrumented physical model designed to study the interaction between a pipe network flow and a floodplain flow. The full range of sewer-to-surface and surface-to-sewer flow conditions at the exchange zone are experimentally analysed in both steady and unsteady flow regimes. Steady state measured discharges are first analysed considering the relationship between the energy heads from the sewer flow and the floodplain flow; these results show that existing weir and orifice formulae are valid for describing the flow exchange for the present physical model, and yield new calibrated discharge coefficients for each of the flow conditions. The measured exchange discharges are also integrated (as a source term) within a 2D numerical flood model (a finite volume solver to the 2D Shallow Water Equations (SWE)), which is shown to reproduce the observed coefficients.

Results show that the numerical model overestimated the values of mean surcharge flow rate. This suggests the occurrence of additional head losses in unsteady conditions which are not currently accounted for within flood models calibrated in steady flow conditions. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-19 23:32:28","2018-01-19 23:32:28","","421-432","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; discharge; hydrological modeling; Floods; Equations of motion; 2D shallow water equations; numerical model; floodplain; model validation; Sewers; Banks (bodies of water); experimental design; flood; Hydraulic structures; Weirs; Numerical models; pipe flow; unsteady flow; Experimental facilities; steady flow; Unsteady flow; two-dimensional flow; Steady flow; Discharge coefficients; Experimental and numerical validations; Experimental calibration; Free surfaces; Orifices; Two Dimensional (2 D); Unsteady conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study introduces a nonlinear cross-entropy clustering (CEC) method for classification of catchments. The method specifically considers embedding dimension (m), sample entropy (SampEn), and coefficient of variation (CV) to represent dimensionality, complexity, and variability of the time series, respectively. The method is applied to daily streamflow time series from 217 gauging stations across Australia. The results suggest that a combination of linear and nonlinear parameters (i.e. m, SampEn, and CV), representing different aspects of the underlying dynamics of streamflows, could be useful for determining distinct patterns of flow generation mechanisms within a nonlinear clustering framework. For the 217 streamflow time series, nine hydrologically homogeneous clusters that have distinct patterns of flow regime characteristics and specific dominant hydrological attributes with different climatic features are obtained. Comparison of the results with those obtained using the widely employed k-means clustering method (which results in five clusters, with the loss of some information about the features of the clusters) suggests the superiority of the cross-entropy clustering method. The outcomes from this study provide a useful guideline for employing the nonlinear dynamic approaches based on hydrologic signatures and for gaining an improved understanding of streamflow variability at a large scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:32:40","2018-01-19 23:32:40","","433-446","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Runoff; Time series; catchment; classification; cluster analysis; streamflow; Entropy; parameter estimation; flow pattern; numerical model; numerical method; Catchments; flow measurement; time series; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Stream flow; Clustering algorithms; hydrological regime; Catchment classifications; entropy; Cross entropy; False nearest neighbor; K-means clustering; nearest neighbor analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the proposed model the effects of memory length of different karst flow systems of base-flow, intermediate-flow, and quick-flow and also time variation of recharge area (RA) during a hydrological year were investigated. The model consists of three sub-models: soil moisture balance (SMB), epikarst balance (EPB), and groundwater balance (GWB) to simulate the daily spring discharge. The SMB and EPB sub-models utilize the mass conservation equation to compute the variation of moisture storages in the soil cover and epikarst, respectively. The GWB sub-model computes the spring discharge hydrograph through three parallel linear reservoirs for base-flow, intermediate-flow, and quick-flow. Three antecedent recharge indices are defined and embedded in the model structure to deal with the memory effect of three karst flow systems to antecedent recharge flow. The Sasan Karst aquifer located in the semi-arid region of south-west Iran with a continuous long-term (21-years) daily meteorological and discharge data are considered to describe model calibration and validation procedures. The effects of temporal variations of RA of karst formations during the hydrological year namely invariant RA, two RA (winter and summer), four RA (seasonal), and twelve RA (monthly) are assessed to determine their impact on the model efficiency. Results indicated that the proposed model with monthly-variant RA is able to reproduce acceptable simulation results based on modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE = −0.83). The results of density-based global sensitivity analysis for dry (June to September) and a wet (October to May) period reveal the dominant influence of RA (with sensitivity indices equal to 0.89 and 0.93, respectively) in spring discharge simulation. The sensitivity of simulated spring discharge to memory effect of different karst formations during the dry period is greater than the wet period. In addition, the results reveal the important role of intermediate-flow system in the hydrological modeling of karst systems during the wet period. Precise estimation of groundwater budgets for a better decision making regarding water supplies from complex karst systems with long memory effect can considerably be improved by use of the proposed model. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:33:01","2018-01-19 23:33:01","","225-240","","","552","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; Rain; Sensitivity analysis; groundwater; rainfall-runoff modeling; soil moisture; sensitivity analysis; Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; decision making; Global sensitivity analysis; karst hydrology; Water supply; Budget control; Efficiency; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; Soils; Landforms; Digital storage; hydrograph; Reservoirs (water); Soil conservation; water budget; semiarid region; Sensitivity indices; Model calibration and validation; Moisture; Recharging (underground waters); baseflow; Underground reservoirs; spring (season); Embedded systems; Confined flow; Intermediate storage; Mass conservation equations; Recharge area; Reservoir modeling; soil cover","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The kriged maps of three different criteria (i.e. marginal entropy of water table levels, estimation error variances of mean values of water table levels, and estimation values of long-term changes in water level) are combined for determining monitoring sub-areas of high and low priorities in order to consider different spatial patterns for each sub-area. The best spatial sampling scheme is selected by applying a new method, in which a regular hexagonal gridding pattern and the Thiessen polygon approach are respectively utilized in sub-areas of high and low monitoring priorities. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a S-T kriging models are used to simulate water level fluctuations. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, results of the ANN and S-T kriging models are combined using a data fusion technique. The concept of Value of Information (VOI) is utilized to determine two stations with maximum information values in both sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities. The observed groundwater level data of these two stations are considered for the power of trend detection, estimating periodic fluctuations and mean values of the stationary components, which are used for determining non-uniform sampling frequencies for sub-areas. The proposed methodology is applied to the Dehgolan plain in northwestern Iran. The results show that a new sampling configuration with 35 and 7 monitoring stations and sampling intervals of 20 and 32 days, respectively in sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities, leads to a more efficient monitoring network than the existing one containing 52 monitoring stations and monthly temporal sampling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:33:14","2018-01-19 23:33:14","","267-282","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; design; groundwater; optimization; water planning; Estimation; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Neural networks; spatiotemporal analysis; conceptual framework; sampling; Water levels; groundwater flow; data acquisition; Interpolation; kriging; water level; Monitoring; Non-uniform; monitoring system; Sampling frequencies; Value of information; Data fusion; Water-level fluctuation; Groundwater monitoring networks; Kriging methods; Periodic fluctuations; polygon; Stationary components","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the nutrients, phosphorus enrichment has recently drawn considerable attention due to major environmental issues such as Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay eutrophication. One approach for mitigating the impacts of excessive nutrients on water resources is the implementation of wetlands. However, proper site selection for wetland implementation is the key for effective water quality management at the watershed scale, which is the goal of this study. In this regard, three conventional and two pseudo-random targeting methods were considered. A watershed model called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with another model called System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis IntegratioN (SUSTAIN) to simulate the impacts of wetland implementation scenarios in the Saginaw River watershed, located in Michigan. The inter-group similarities of the targeting strategies were investigated and it was shown that the level of similarity increases as the target area increases (0.54–0.86). In general, the conventional targeting method based on phosphorus load generated per unit area at the subwatershed scale had the highest average reduction among all the scenarios (44.46 t/year). However, when considering the total area of implemented wetlands, the conventional method based on long-term impacts of wetland implementation showed the highest amount of phosphorus reduction (36.44 t/year). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:33:24","2018-01-19 23:33:24","","105-120","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; United States; Water management; Water quality; Water resources; water quality; watershed; soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Watersheds; nutrient use; Soil and water assessment tool; Michigan; Reduction; Water conservation; Great Lakes [North America]; Lakes; Nutrients; Quality management; River pollution; phosphorus; Phosphorus; Wetlands; site selection; wetland; Eutrophication; Agricultural practices; Lake Erie; reduction; Chesapeake Bay; eutrophication; Site selection; Implementation strategies; Random implementation; Saginaw Basin; SUSTAIN; Targeting method; Water quality degradation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results showed that the response of source contributions to SOM displayed difference significantly during different rainfall processes, showing fluctuation with flow. Subsoil was the main source of SOM pool for two similar small watersheds (accounting for 38.50% for QWW and 35.63% for QEW).

This paper evaluates a new hydrological model capable of simulating river flows for a range of basin scales (100 km2 to &gt;10,000 km2), and a particular focus on mid- and north-latitude regions. The new model combines the runoff generation and fully distributed routing framework of the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model with a new land surface process model that strictly couples water and energy balances at the SVA layer, imposing closed energy balance solutions. The model is vectorized and parallelized to achieve long-term (&gt;30 years) high-resolution (30 m to 500 m and subhourly) simulations of large river basins utilizing high-performance computing. The model is tested in the Connecticut River basin (20,000 km2), where flooding is frequently associated with interactions of snowmelt triggered by rainfall events.

When this excess water is managed using stormwater drainage systems, flow and water quality regimes of urban streams are severely altered, leading to the degradation of their ecosystems. Urban streams restoration requires alternative approaches towards stormwater management, which aim to restore the flow regime towards pre-development conditions. The practice of stormwater infiltration—achieved using a range of stormwater source-control measures (SCMs)—is central to restoring baseflow. Despite this, little is known about what happens to the infiltrated water. Current knowledge about the impact of stormwater infiltration on flow regimes was reviewed. Infiltration systems were found to be efficient at attenuating high-flow hydrology (reducing peak magnitudes and frequencies) at a range of scales (parcel, streetscape, catchment). Several modelling studies predict a positive impact of stormwater infiltration on baseflow, and empirical evidence is emerging, but the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains unclear. It is not known how infiltrated water travels along the subsurface pathways that characterise the urban environment, in particular the ‘urban karst’, which results from networks of human-made subsurface pathways, e.g. stormwater and sanitary sewer pipes and associated high permeability trenches. Seepage of groundwater into and around such pipes is possible, meaning some infiltrated stormwater could travel along artificial pathways. The catchment-scale ability of infiltration systems to restore groundwater recharge and baseflow is thus ambiguous. Further understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater is required to ensure infiltration systems deliver optimal outcomes for waterway flow regimes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:33:58","2018-01-19 23:33:58","","141-150","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Water quality; catchment; groundwater; water quality; water management; Groundwater; runoff; infiltration; karst hydrology; Catchments; Storm-water managements; Storms; urban drainage; Landforms; Engineering geology; Impervious surface; Low impact development; Storm sewers; Ground water recharge; recharge; stormwater; Infiltration; Recharging (underground waters); karst; baseflow; Restoration; Sanitary sewer pipes; Stormwater drainage; Stormwater infiltrations; Trenching; Urban karst","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the impact of underground structures on the intrinsic vulnerability of urban aquifers was investigated. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a 2D deterministic modelling approach based on the reservoir theory generalized to hydrodispersive systems to better understand this mixing phenomenon and the mixing affected zone (MAZ) caused by underground structures. It was shown that the maximal extent of the MAZ caused by an underground structure is reached approximately 20 years after construction. Consequently, underground structures represent a long-term threat for deep aquifer reservoirs. Regarding the construction process, draining operations have a major impact and favour large-scale mixing between shallow and deep groundwater. Consequently, dewatering should be reduced and enclosed as much as possible. The role played by underground structures’ dimensions was assessed. The obstruction of the first aquifer layer caused by construction has the greatest influence on the MAZ. The cumulative impact of several underground structures was assessed. It was shown that the total MAZ area increases linearly with underground structures’ density. The role played by materials’ properties and hydraulic gradient were assessed. Hydraulic conductivity, anisotropy and porosity have the strongest influence on the development of MAZ. Finally, an empirical law was derived to estimate the MAZ caused by an underground structure in a bi-layered aquifer under unconfined conditions. This empirical law, based on the results of the sensitivity analysis developed in this paper, allows for the estimation of MAZ dimensions under known material properties and underground structure dimensions. This empirical law can help urban planners assess the area of influence of underground structures and protect urban strategic reservoirs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:34:10","2018-01-19 23:34:10","","460-473","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; aquifer pollution; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; vulnerability; urban area; empirical analysis; Urban planning; Mixing; Hydraulic gradients; Groundwater ages; Underground reservoirs; pollutant source; Aquifer reservoirs; Construction process; Deterministic modelling; dewatering; Intrinsic vulnerability; Unconfined conditions; underground construction; Underground structures; Urban groundwater; urban pollution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The numerical model was calibrated to match well with field drawdown, and calculated flow regime in the well was used to predict the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the purging period. The model was then used to analyze sampling representativeness and sampling time. Site characteristics, such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and sampling choices, such as purging rate and screen length, were found to be significant determinants of sampling representativeness and required sampling time. Results demonstrated that: (1) DO was the most useful water quality indicator in ensuring groundwater sampling representativeness in comparison with turbidity, pH, specific conductance, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and temperature; (2) it is not necessary to maintain a drawdown of less than 0.1 m when conducting low flow purging. However, a high purging rate in a low permeability aquifer may result in a dramatic decrease in sampling representativeness after an initial peak; (3) the presence of a short screen length may result in greater drawdown and a longer sampling time for low-flow purging.

This concept is inspired from modular frameworks, empirical model development, and multimodel applications, and encompasses the overproduce and select paradigm. The EMF concept aims to reduce subjectivity in conceptual hydrological modeling practice and includes model selection in the optimisation steps, reducing initial assumptions on the prior perception of the dominant rainfall-runoff transformation processes. EMF generates thousands of new modeling options from, for now, twelve parent models that share their functional components and parameters. Optimisation resorts to ensemble calibration, ranking and selection of individual child time series based on optimal bias and reliability trade-offs, as well as accuracy and sharpness improvement of the ensemble. Results on 37 snow-dominated Canadian catchments and 20 climatically-diversified American catchments reveal the excellent potential of the EMF in generating new individual model alternatives, with high respective performance values, that may be pooled efficiently into ensembles of seven to sixty constitutive members, with low bias and high accuracy, sharpness, and reliability. A group of 1446 new models is highlighted to offer good potential on other catchments or applications, based on their individual and collective interests. An analysis of the preferred functional components reveals the importance of the production and total flow elements. Overall, results from this research confirm the added value of ensemble and flexible approaches for hydrological applications, especially in uncertain contexts, and open up new modeling possibilities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:34:34","2018-01-19 23:34:34","","313-340","","","552","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Runoff; catchment; optimization; performance assessment; rainfall-runoff modeling; hydrological modeling; Climate models; calibration; accuracy assessment; Catchments; empirical analysis; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; experimental design; time series; ensemble forecasting; Multi-model ensemble; perception; Modular approach; Multi-structure; Overproduce and select","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Turbulent flow is associated with large apertures and rapid velocities, and these occur most frequently in carbonate aquifers. Methods for identifying turbulent flow include correlating spring discharge with head variation, calculating Reynolds numbers from spring discharge and tracer velocity, and plotting the spatial variation of head differences between high flow and low flow. The probability of turbulent flow increases as a function of permeability and of spring discharge, and the probability increases in a downgradient direction in an aquifer. Spring discharge is a key parameter for evaluating the presence of turbulent flow, which is likely to occur where a spring with a discharge > 1 L/s is fed by a single channel.

This study evaluates whether a measure of catchment urban extent can account for differences in runoff generation from storm events along an rural-urban gradient. We employed a high-resolution monitoring network across 8 catchments in the south of the UK - ranging from predominantly rural to heavily urbanised - over a four year period, and from this selected 336 storm events. Hydrological response was compared using volume- and scaled time-based hydrograph metrics within a statistical framework that considered the effect of antecedent soil moisture. Clear differences were found between rural and urban catchments, however above a certain threshold of urban extent runoff volume was relatively unaffected by changes and runoff response times were highly variable between catchments due to additional hydraulic controls. Results indicate a spatial measure of urbanisation can generally explain differences in the hydrological response between rural and urban catchments but is insufficient to explain differences between urban catchments along an urban gradient. Antecedent soil moisture alters the volume and timing of runoff generated in catchments with large rural areas, but was not found to affect the runoff response where developed areas are much greater. The results of this study suggest some generalised relationships between urbanisation and storm runoff are not represented in observed storm events and point to limitations in using a simplified representations of the urban environment for attribution of storm runoff in small urban catchments. The study points to the need for enhanced hydrologically relevant catchment descriptors specific to small urban catchments and more focused research on the role of urban soils and soil moisture in storm runoff generation in mixed land-use catchments. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:34:55","2018-01-19 23:34:55","","474-489","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United Kingdom; catchment; soil moisture; spatial analysis; urbanization; hydrological modeling; Land use; runoff; Catchments; Storms; Soil moisture; Soils; hydrograph; rural area; hydrological response; Hydrological response; land use change; storm; Spatial variables measurement; Rural areas; Moisture; Storm runoff; Hydraulic machinery; Antecedent soil moisture; Descriptors; Urbanisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The causes of peak flood changes were also investigated. Results indicated that: (1) floods were subject to more seasonality and temporal clustering when compared to precipitation extremes. However, seasonality of floods and extreme precipitation was subject to spatial heterogeneity in northern Guangdong. Similar changing patterns of peak floods and extreme precipitation were found in coastal regions; (2) significant increasing/decreasing seasonality, but no confirmed spatial patterns, were observed for peak floods and extreme precipitation. Peak floods in northern Guangdong province had decreasing variability, but had larger variability in coastal regions; (3) tropical cyclones had remarkable impacts on extreme precipitation changes in coastal regions of southeastern China, and peak floods as well. The landfalling of tropical cyclones was decreasing and concentrated during June–September; this is the major reason for earlier but enhanced seasonality of peak floods in coastal regions.

The analysis found substantial differences between reference datasets in terms of the specific stations that exhibited significant increasing or decreasing trends, showing the need for careful construction of statistical methods. The results were more consistent at the continental scale, with decreasing trends for a large number of stations in western North America and the data-covered regions of Australia, and increasing trends in parts of Europe, eastern North America, parts of South America and southern Africa. Interestingly, neither the presence of dams nor changes in forest cover had a large effect on the trend results, but the catchment size was important, as catchments exhibiting increasing (decreasing) trends tended to be smaller (larger).

These ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. La Pletera salt marshes (NE Spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a Life+ project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. Several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. In this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in La Pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. In order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (δ18OH2O and δD) campaigns have been conducted, from November 2014 to October 2015. In particular, groundwater from six wells, surface water from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. Taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the General Lake Model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. In addition, the Gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical-speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. Results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15–80% of the water in La Pletera lagoons. Besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. According to the obtained results, the goal of preserving La Pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-19 23:35:29","2018-01-19 23:35:29","","793-806","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","connectivity; dry season; groundwater; Spain; Ecology; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Seawater; Meteorology; Ecosystems; biodiversity; Biodiversity; hydrodynamics; ecosystem function; Water levels; Lakes; human activity; ecosystem service; Chemical analysis; urban development; Nutrients; Conservation; Isotopes; stable isotope; coastal zone management; Urban growth; protected area; Wetlands; Ecological functioning; Sustainable management; hydrological regime; coastal lagoon; physicochemical property; Evaporation; environmental restoration; Physicochemical process; Hydraulic connectivity; coastal protection; Stable water isotopes; Catalonia; Coastal lagoons; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Lake model; Plankton; saltmarsh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, the input variables for forecasting the suspended sediment load are manually selected based on the maximum correlations of input variables in the modeling approaches based on NN and RSM. The RSM is improved to select the input variables by using the errors terms of training data based on the GHS, namely as response surface method and global harmony search (RSM-GHS) modeling method. The second-order polynomial function with cross terms is applied to calibrate the time series suspended sediment load with three, four and five input variables in the proposed RSM-GHS. The linear, square and cross corrections of twenty input variables of antecedent values of suspended sediment load and water discharge are investigated to achieve the best predictions of the RSM based on the GHS method. The performances of the NN, RSM and proposed RSM-GHS including both accuracy and simplicity are compared through several comparative predicted and error statistics.

Modeling approaches to forecast groundwater recharge typically require observed historic data to assist calibration. It is generally not possible to observe groundwater recharge rates directly. Therefore, in the past, much effort has been invested to record soil moisture content (SMC) data, which can be used in a water balance calculation to estimate groundwater recharge. In this context, SMC data is measured at different depths and then typically integrated with respect to depth to obtain a single set of aggregated SMC values, which are used as an estimate of the total water stored within a given soil profile. This article seeks to investigate the value of such aggregated SMC data for conditioning groundwater recharge models in this respect. A simple modeling approach is adopted, which utilizes an emulation of Richards’ equation in conjunction with a soil texture pedotransfer function. The only unknown parameters are soil texture. Monte Carlo simulation is performed for four different SMC monitoring sites. The model is used to estimate both aggregated SMC and groundwater recharge. The impact of conditioning the model to the aggregated SMC data is then explored in terms of its ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with recharge estimation. Whilst uncertainty in soil texture can lead to significant uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimation, it is found that aggregated SMC is virtually insensitive to soil texture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:35:52","2018-01-19 23:35:52","","258-266","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; Water resources; groundwater; soil moisture; Monte Carlo methods; water management; parameterization; Monte Carlo analysis; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; calibration; Soil moisture; Soils; estimation method; Soil surveys; Waterresource management; Ground water recharge; recharge; Moisture; Moisture determination; Recharging (underground waters); percolation; Solvents; soil texture; soil profile; Simple modeling; Pedo-transfer functions; conditioning; Model approach; Monitoring sites; Natural gas conditioning; Recharge estimation; Soil textures; vertical profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing studies have revealed an accelerated lake expansion on the Changtang Plateau during the 2000s compared with prior decades. However, the partial hiatus of recent Landsat archive affected the continuation of understanding the lake changes in the recent decade. Here we synergistically used imagery from Landsat and Huanjing satellites to enable a detailed monitoring of lake area dynamics on the Changtang Plateau. Our results present that lakes on the Changtang Plateau continued to expand at a rapid rate of 340.79 km2 yr−1 (1.06% yr−1, p &lt; 0.05) from 2009 to 2014. Changes in endorheic (terminal) lakes contribute to 98% of the net expansion, suggesting that monitoring endorheic lake dynamics is of critical importance for understanding climate changes. Meanwhile, changes in saline lakes, which are mostly endorheic, account for 96% of the net expansion, implying that the proportion of freshwater storage on the Changtang Plateau is likely in decline. Rapid expansion occurred in both glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes, with a rate of 224.94 km2 yr−1 (0.92% yr−1, p &lt; 0.05) and 115.85 km2 yr−1 (1.47% yr−1, p = 0.08), respectively, indicating that glacier retreat alone may not fully explain the recent lake expansion. Intra-annual variations of the selected 24 large lakes fluctuated within 0.22–2.46% (in coefficient of variation) for glacier-fed lakes and 0.17–2.36% for non-glacier-fed lakes. Most of these lakes expanded during the unfrozen period (from May/June to October) and reached to their maximum extents in September or October. By spatially associating our revealed lake changes with climate variables, we observed that the recent lake expansion is more related to precipitation than to temperature, although future efforts are needed for a more comprehensive picture of the lake changing mechanisms. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-19 23:36:01","2018-01-19 23:36:01","","633-645","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; hydrological cycle; satellite data; climate change; Satellites; Digital storage; Lakes; freshwater; climate effect; monitoring; Dynamics; annual variation; Landsat; satellite imagery; Hydrological cycles; lacustrine environment; Coefficient of variation; alpine environment; drainage basin; Annual variations; LANDSAT; Alpine lakes; Changtang Plateau; Changthang Plateau; Expansion; Freshwater storages; glacier retreat; hiatus; Multi-mission satellites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, we suggest an efficient approach for selecting the nonlinear functions of a nonstationary GEV model. Based on observed and multiple projected AMP data for eight cities across the U.S., three separate tasks are proposed. First, we conduct trend and stationarity tests for the observed and projected data. Second, AMP series are fit with thirty different nonlinear functions, and the best functions among these are selected. Finally, the selected nonlinear functions are used to model the location parameter of a nonstationary GEV model and stationary and nonstationary GEV models with a linear function.

Fruitfully, we find that the growth in numbers of such publications has continued to accelerate, and attention to both the biophysical and socioeconomic aspects has also been growing. On the other hand, our analysis strongly indicates that the former continue to dominate, partly by embracing integration with other biophysical sectors related to water – environment, groundwater, ecology, climate change and agriculture. In the social sciences the integration is occurring predominantly through economics, with the others, including law, policy and stakeholder participation, much diminished in comparison. We find there has been increasing attention to management and decision support systems, but a much weaker focus on uncertainty, a pervasive concern whose criticalities must be identified and managed for improving decision making.

More than 60 years after Leopold and Maddock (1953) first introduced the concept of HG, researchers have still not uncovered the physical principles underlying HG behavior. One impediment is the complexity of the natural river cross section. The current study presents a new way to simplify the cross section, namely, the hydraulic equivalent section, which is generalized from the cross section in the “gradually varied flow of an alluvial river” (GVFAR) and features hydrodynamic properties and bed-building laws similar to those of the GVFAR. Energy balance was used to derive the stage Z-discharge Q relationship in the GVFAR. The GVFAR in the Songhua River and the Yangtze River were selected as examples. The data, including measured discharge, river width, water stage, water depth, wet area, and cross section, were collected from the hydrological yearbooks of typical hydrological stations on the Songhua River and the Yangtze River from 1955 to 1987. The relationships between stage Z-discharge Q and cross-sectional area A-stage Z at various stations were analyzed, and “at-a-station hydraulic geometry” (AHG) relationships were obtained in power-law forms. Based on derived results and observational data analysis, the Z-Q and Z-A relationships of AHG were similar to rectangular weir flows, thus the cross section of the GVFAR was generalized as a compound rectangular, hydraulic equivalent cross section. As to bed-building characteristics, the bankfull discharge method and the stage-discharge-relation method were used to calculate the dominant variables of the alluvial river. This hydraulic equivalent section has the same Z-Q relation, Z-A relation, dominant discharge, dominant river width, and dominant water depth as the cross section in the GVFAR. With the hydraulic equivalent section, the relationships between the discharge and river width, river depth, and width-to-depth ratio are easier to depict in DHG analysis. Replacement of the cross section in the GVFAR with the hydraulic equivalent section is expected to promote further development of HG. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:36:38","2018-01-19 23:36:38","","407-420","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; river discharge; river flow; Rivers; Aquatic ecosystems; hydrodynamics; Geometry; river basin; freshwater ecosystem; geometry; Stream flow; Hydrological analysis; Yangtze River; aquatic environment; Hydraulic geometry; water depth; stage-discharge relationship; Alluvial river; At-a-station hydraulic geometries; Building characteristics; Equivalent cross section; Hydrodynamic properties; Songhua River; Stage-discharge relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions.

To further address this issue, long-term soil moisture data were retrieved from two large scale monitoring networks located in the continental United States, including the Michigan Automated Weather Network and the Oklahoma Mesonet. To evaluate different controls on SMSV, supporting datasets, which contained data on climate, soil, topography, and vegetation, were also compiled from various sources. Based on temporal stability analysis, the results showed that the mean relative difference (MRD) of soil moisture was more correlated with soil texture (e.g., negative correlations between MRD and sand fraction, and positive ones between MRD and silt and clay fractions) than with meteorological forcings in both regions, which differed from the traditional notion that meteorological forcings were the dominant controls on regional SMSV. Moreover, the results revealed that contrary to the previous conjecture, the use of soil moisture temporal anomaly did not reduce the impacts of static properties (e.g., soil properties) on soil moisture temporal dynamics. Instead, it was found that the magnitude of soil moisture temporal anomaly was mainly negatively correlated with sand fraction and positively with silt and clay fractions in both regions. Finally, the relationship between the spatial average and standard deviation of soil moisture as well as soil moisture temporal anomaly was investigated using the data from both networks. The field data showed that the relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomaly was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation). The results of this study provided strong field evidence that local factors (e.g., soil properties) might outweigh regional factors (e.g., meteorological forcings) in controlling regional SMSV. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:37:04","2018-01-19 23:37:04","","578-585","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climatic conditions; United States; soil moisture; spatial analysis; temporal analysis; Michigan; Soil moisture; Soils; spatial variation; Soil surveys; Moisture; climate forcing; Meteorological forcing; climate conditions; Spatial variability; Negative correlation; Oklahoma [United States]; soil texture; Silt; Soil textures; Large-scale monitoring; Regional scale; silty soil; Temporal anomaly","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water trading arrangements, on their own, are not about setting bio-physical limits to water-use. Nevertheless, water trading that mitigates scarcity constraints can assist regulators of water resources to keep water-use within limits at the lowest possible cost, and may reduce the cost of restoring water system health. While theoretically attractive, many practitioners have, at best, only a limited understanding of the practical usefulness of markets and how they might be most appropriately deployed. Using lessons learned from jurisdictions around the world where water markets have been implemented, this study attempts to fill the existing water market development gap and provide an initial framework (the water market readiness assessment (WMRA)) to describe the policy and administrative conditions/reforms necessary to enable governments/jurisdictions to develop water trading arrangements that are efficient, equitable and within sustainable limits. Our proposed framework consists of three key steps: 1) an assessment of hydrological and institutional needs; 2) a market evaluation, including assessment of development and implementation issues; and 3) the monitoring, continuous/review and assessment of future needs; with a variety of questions needing assessment at each stage. We apply the framework to three examples: regions in Australia, the United States and Spain.

Here, we hypothesise that ignoring physiological differences and competition between species when managing wetland hydrologic regimes can lead to a decrease in vegetation diversity, even when the overall wetland carrying capacity is improved. Using an ecohydrological model capable of resolving water-vegetation-salt feedbacks, we investigate why water surface and groundwater management interventions to combat vegetation decline have been more beneficial to Casuarina obesa than to Melaleuca strobophylla, the co-dominant tree species in Lake Toolibin, a salt-affected wetland in Western Australia. The simulations reveal that in trying to reduce the negative effect of salinity, the management interventions have created an environment favouring C. obesa by intensifying the climate-induced trend that the wetland has been experiencing of lower water availability and higher root-zone salinity. By testing alternative scenarios, we show that interventions that improve M. strobophylla biomass are possible by promoting hydrologic conditions that are less specific to the niche requirements of C. obesa. Modelling uncertainties were explored via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of including species differentiation and competition in ecohydrological models that form the basis for wetland management. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:37:26","2018-01-19 23:37:26","","121-140","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Markov chain; Vegetation; Water management; groundwater; water availability; ecohydrology; water management; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Groundwater; Markov processes; semiarid region; deciduous tree; Wetlands; vegetation dynamics; Eco-hydrological models; Semi-arid region; biomass; Western Australia; Markov chain monte carlo algorithms; wetland management; Casuarina obesa; competition (ecology); Management interventions; Melaleuca; Physiological differences; Salt-affected wetland; Species differentiations; Toolibin Lake; Wetland management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since fine particle loading rates are not unique functions of stream discharge this limits the utility of the available models for water quality assessment. Data from 38 minimally developed watersheds within the United States Geological Survey stream gauging network in California, USA reveal three lines of evidence that fine particle release is coupled with bedload transport. First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge. While these observations were individually recognized in the literature, this analysis provides a consistent conceptual model based on the coupling of fine particle dynamics with filtration at low discharges and gravel bed fluidization at higher discharges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:37:39","2018-01-19 23:37:39","","532-543","","","552","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water quality; discharge; surface water; water quality; sediment transport; Sediments; watershed; Watersheds; particle size; suspended load; Surface waters; California; Gravel; Bed-load transport; bedload; gravel bed stream; High frequency HF; Water quality assessments; geological survey; sediment yield; fine grained sediment; gravel; hysteresis; Suspended solids; solid; fluidization; Fluidization; Loading rate; Particle concentrations; Transition discharges; United states geological surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For both aqueous and sediment phases, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT), total vanadium (V) concentration (CTotal-V), and community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction data were used to measure the pollution characteristics, horizontal and vertical distributions of DGT-labile V, and the dynamic mobilization of V in a typical tributary (the Meixi River) of the TGR. The results showed that CTotal-V in the surface sediments were obviously higher than the background values in sediment and soil, indicating a potential anthropogenic input of V in this area. A positive relationship was found between total organic carbon (TOC) and CTotal-V in the sediments, indicating that the pollution characteristics of V were associated with TOC. In addition, horizontal and vertical distributions of the fluxes of DGT-labile V (FDGT-V) varied among the four DGT probes. In the same DGT probe, the horizontal distributions (0–6 mm, 6–12 mm and 12–18 mm) of FDGT-V were similar in the overlying water; however, the values showed a poor coincidence with those recorded in the sediment. The vertical distribution of FDGT-V in the same DGT probe showed similar tendencies. In fact, CDGT-V is significantly negatively correlated with CDGT-Fe, demonstrating that V had an inversely diffusive tendency with Fe. Moreover, diffusion fluxes of V at the sediment-water interface illustrated that the release characteristics of V varied among the sampling sites. In addition, the BCR fraction of V in the surface sediments of the four sampling sites showed that V mainly existed in the residual fraction (88.04–88.57%). The concentrations of DGT-labile V (CDGT-V) were considerably lower than the non-residual fractions (the sum of exchangeable, reducible, and oxidizable fractions) measured by BCR sequential extraction. Correlation analysis showed that CDGT-V had no correlation with non-residual V fractions, indicating that it is doubtful whether BCR extraction alone can be used to predict the bioavailability of V in this study. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:37:51","2018-01-19 23:37:51","","92-99","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; Sediments; Pollution; concentration (composition); Extraction; spatial distribution; Carbon; anthropogenic source; sediment-water interface; Organic carbon; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; fluvial deposit; diffusion; tributary; mobilization; Probes; total organic carbon; Positive ions; Three gorges reservoir; Three Gorges Reservoir; Sediment water interface; reservoir impoundment; bioavailability; BCR sequential extraction; Biochemistry; Community bureau of references; Diffusion in solids; Diffusive gradients in thin films; film; pollution monitoring; Release characteristics; sequential extraction; Sequential extraction; Surficial sediments; Thin films; vanadium; Vanadium; Water resource protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study took Jinjiang River basin in the southeast coastal region of China as an example, where the Shilong hydrometric station is influenced by a large reservoir (Shanmei), and the Anxi hydrological station is not. Based on monthly data of streamflow with precipitation and historical drought records from 1960 to 2010, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) series (representing meteorological drought and hydrological drought, respectively) were each calculated with a 3-month timescale. Run theory was then used to identify the characteristics of meteorological and hydrological drought, including duration and magnitude. The relationship with which hydrological drought responds to meteorological drought was established by a non-linear function model at the Anxi station and Shilong station which reflected the periods of natural condition without reservoir and reservoir-influence condition, respectively. The results indicate that (1) there was a clear non-linear relationship of hydrological drought and meteorological drought, and the threshold within which hydrological drought started to respond to meteorological drought was obtained according to the non-linear function model; (2) the operational activities of the Shanmei reservoir during 1983–2010 have significantly reduced the duration and magnitude of hydrological drought at the Shilong station compared to the natural-influence period of 1960–1982, which, in turn, altered the relationship between the hydrological drought and meteorological drought.

The goal of this research was to develop and test an approach for assessing the risk of SWI in coastal aquifers. The Gulf Islands in British Columbia (BC) was the case study area. The vulnerability of the bedrock aquifers to SWI was assessed spatially by mapping hazards in combination with the aquifer susceptibility. Climate change related hazards, including SLR and storm surge overwash, were integrated into floodplain maps for each island using projected SLR data for 2100 in combination with estimated storm surge levels based on data collected over a forty year period. When combined with maps showing the density of pumping wells, coastal zones that may be at higher risk of SWI were identified for this particular coastal area of BC. Hazards due to pumping have the greatest influence on the vulnerability. Risk was evaluated spatially using an economic valuation of loss – here replacement of a water supply. The combination of chemical indicators of SWI and risk assessment maps are potentially useful tools for identifying areas vulnerable to SWI, and these tools can be used to improve decision-making related to monitoring and community development for coastal areas, thereby increasing resilience. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:38:13","2018-01-19 23:38:13","","730-745","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Decision making; Risk assessment; groundwater; water supply; British Columbia; Hydrogeology; climate change; water quality; Floods; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mercury (metal); risk assessment; saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; vulnerability; Economics; Hazards; Water supply; Canada; floodplain; Sea level; Sea level rise; Storms; coastal zone; Coastal zones; Pumps; valuation; coastal aquifer; Regional planning; pumping; storm surge; Coastal aquifers; Bedrock aquifers; Coastal regions; community development; Community development; Economic valuation; Gulf Islands; Indicators (chemical); Optical pumping; Overwash","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is submitted together with Kovacs et al. (2017). Kovacs et al. focuses on the salinity levels of the meteoric lens, while this paper uses the observed results to elucidate the hydrodynamics. The cave passages have water depths on the order of 10 m, with flow on the order of ten centimeters a second, and as such is a hydrodynamic, as opposed to a porous, system. The measurements reveal that episodes of significant mixing between the fresh meteoric lens and the underlying salty water are driven by meteorological events (e.g., Hurricane Rina in 2011, and the twin Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel in 2013). We find evidence that after the hurricanes in 2013, the water column remains unstable for several months. Through wavelet analysis, we find that the marine Water Mass (WM) exhibits much less low period activity compared to the meteoric WM. We hypothesize that the open cenotes are locations of high mixing intensity, with turbulent fronts propagating away from the sites of direct mixing into the cave network. We perform laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to explore this phenomenon, and find that mixing preferentially occurs on the flanks of regions of strong, stable density stratification (i.e., on the periphery of pycnoclines), and leads to entrainment of fluid into the turbulent region. Using high resolution direct numerical simulation, we explore the detailed manner in which turbulent entrainment can drive flow toward the mixing region, and lead to mixing of passive tracers. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the mixing of passive tracers, such as suspended chemicals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:38:24","2018-01-19 23:38:24","","715-729","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Oceanography; time series analysis; saline intrusion; salinity; hydrodynamics; karst hydrology; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; porous medium; water column; water temperature; Mixing; Mexico [North America]; stratification; karst; Laboratory experiments; meteoric water; Numerical models; Hurricanes; Wavelet analysis; entrainment; Karst; cave system; Density stratification; hurricane; Mixer circuits; Mixing intensity; Quintana Roo; Significant mixing; Times series; Turbulent entrainment; turbulent mixing; Turbulent regions; water mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to determine the sources and fate of dissolved sulfate in low-pH karst waters, hydrochemical variations of karst waters with and without acid mine drainage (AMD) impacts were investigated along with stable isotope dynamics. As expected, hydrochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions of the AMD and AMD-downstream water (ADW) were dramatically different from that of the non-AMD-impacted water (NAW). The sources of sulfur isotopes in sulfate were predominantly pyrite oxidation for the AMD and ADW, and atmospheric deposition for the NAW. Based on the general isotope-balance model, the relative proportions of sulfate oxygen derived from water and air were calculated. The mean proportion of sulfate oxygen derived from water in ADW was roughly double that of AMD. This suggests that the sulfate associated with AMD is predominantly influenced by aerobic pyrite oxidation, while that of ADW is likely affected by the dissolution of pyrite under anaerobic conditions in reservoir sediment. This observation was coincident with the noted variations of hydrochemical characteristics and was supported by principal component analysis.

Although there are a plethora of hydrological models, none of them can be directly applied to make water conservation decisions in irregularly bounded areas that do not confirm to topographically defined ridge lines. This study proposes a novel hydrological model that can be directly applied to any catchment, with or without ridge line boundaries. The model is based on the water balance concept, and a linear function concept to approximate the cross-boundary flow from upstream areas to the administrative catchment under consideration. The developed model is tested in 2 watersheds – Riesel Experimental Watershed and a sub-basin of Cedar Creek Watershed in Texas, USA. Hypothetical administrative catchments that did not confirm to the location of ridge lines were considered for verifying the efficacy of the model for hydrologic simulations. The linear function concept used to account the cross boundary flow was based on the hypothesis that the flow coming from outside the boundary to administrative area was proportional to the flow generated in the boundary grid cell. The model performance was satisfactory with an NSE and r2 of ≥0.80 and a PBIAS of &lt;25 in all the cases. The simulated hydrographs for the administrative catchments of the watersheds were in good agreement with the observed hydrographs, indicating a satisfactory performance of the model in the administratively bounded areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:38:49","2018-01-19 23:38:49","","423-439","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Model performance; Runoff; United States; Water management; catchment; performance assessment; streamflow; Hydrological models; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Climate models; runoff; decision making; Watersheds; Water conservation; Catchments; experimental study; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; hydrograph; Hydrological process; basin management; Soil conservation; Texas; water budget; Hydrologic simulations; Watershed management; Experimental watersheds; Cedar Creek Reservoir; Watershed hydrological model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study addresses this challenge by integrating a physical (P) model (SAHYSMOD) with a group (stakeholder) built system dynamics model (GBSDM) through a component modeling approach based on widely applied tools such as MS Excel, Python and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The coupled model (P-GBSDM) was applied to test soil salinity management scenarios (proposed by stakeholders) for the Haveli region of the Rechna Doab Basin in Pakistan. Scenarios such as water banking, vertical drainage, canal lining, and irrigation water reallocation were simulated with the integrated model. Spatiotemporal maps and economic and environmental trade-off criteria were used to examine the effectiveness of the selected management scenarios. After 20 years of simulation, canal lining reduced soil salinity by 22% but caused an initial reduction of 18% in farm income, which requires an initial investment from the government. The government-sponsored Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) is a short-term policy that resulted in a 37% increase in water availability with a 12% increase in farmer income. However, it showed detrimental effects on soil salinity in the long term, with a 21% increase in soil salinity due to secondary salinization. The new P-GBSDM was shown to be an effective platform for engaging stakeholders and simulating their proposed management policies while taking into account socioeconomic considerations.

By recognizing the connection between the cost function of deterministic optimizations and the posterior probability density of stochastic inversions, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler of SN is constructed by two parts: a deterministic part, which corresponds to a Newton step of deterministic optimization, and a stochastic part, which is a Gaussian distribution with the inverse of the local Hessian as the covariance matrix. The hybrid inverse method exploits the efficient tools for fast solution of deterministic inversions to improve the efficiency of the MCMC sampler. To address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, a priori models, generated by a transition-probability geostatistical method, and conditioned to inter-well connection data, are used as regularization constraints. The effectiveness of the stochastic Newton method is first demonstrated by a synthetic test. The transmissivity field of the synthetic model is highly heterogeneous, and includes sharp variations. The inverse approach was then applied to a field hydraulic tomography investigation in a fractured and karstified aquifer to reconstruct its transmissivity field from a collection of real hydraulic head measurements. From the inversions, a series of transmissivity fields that produce good correlations between the inverted and the measured hydraulic heads were obtained. The inverse approach produced slightly different a posteriori transmissivity patterns for different a priori structure models of transmissivity; however, the trend and location of the high-transmissivity channels are consistent among various realizations. In addition, the uncertainty associated with each realization of the inverted transmissivity fields was quantified. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:39:14","2018-01-19 23:39:14","","29-46","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Covariance matrix; Markov chain; Transition probabilities; Hydrogeology; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Monte Carlo analysis; aquifer; Aquifers; karst hydrology; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Chains; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Markov processes; Probability density function; tomography; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; Probability; inverse problem; hydraulic head; Fracture; Newton-Raphson method; Cost functions; Tomography; Deterministic optimization; Hydraulic tomographies; Boreholes; Geostatistical method; Good correlations; Posterior probability; Transfer matrix method; transmissivity; Transmissivity field","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Model parameters were estimated through minimizing the root-mean-square error between the Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived ΔTWS during 2003–2015. The correlation of ensemble means between Budyko-modeled and GRACE-derived ΔTWS is 0.68 with p-value <0.05.

The negative values of the cumulative sum of the reconstructed ΔGWS during 1980–2015 (i.e., −13.6 ± 9.7 cm) indicate that the aquifer in Punjab has experienced depletion.

In mountainous terrain, plot-level measurements are important to achieving this. Forest inventory data including tree density and size measurements, often collected repeatedly over decades, sample the variability occurring within the geographic and topographic range of specific forest types. Using simple allometric relationships, tree stocking and size data can be used to estimate variables including sapwood area index (SAI), which may be strongly correlated with annual Ea. This study analysed plot-level variability in SAI and its relationship with overstorey and understorey transpiration, interception and evaporation over a 670 m elevation gradient, in non-water-limited, even-aged stands of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. to determine how well spatial variation in annual Ea from forests can be mapped using SAI. Over the 3 year study, mean sap velocity in five E. regnans stands was uncorrelated with overstorey sapwood area index (SAI) or elevation: annual transpiration was predicted well by SAI (R2 0.98). Overstorey and total annual interception were positively correlated with SAI (R2 0.90 and 0.75). Ea from the understorey was strongly correlated with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and net radiation (Rn) measured just above the understorey, but relationships between understorey Ea and VPD and Rn differed between understorey types and understorey annual Ea was not correlated with SAI. Annual total Ea was also strongly correlated with SAI: the relationship being similar to two previous studies in the same region, despite differences in stand age and species.

Many Mediterranean rivers have their headwaters in mountainous regions where hydrological processes are driven by snowpack dynamics and the specific variability of the Mediterranean climate. A good knowledge of the snow processes in the Mediterranean mountains is therefore a key element of water management strategies in such regions. The objective of this paper is to review the literature on snow hydrology in Mediterranean mountains to identify the existing knowledge, key research questions, and promising technologies. We collected 620 peer-reviewed papers, published between 1913 and 2016, that deal with the Mediterranean-like mountain regions in the western United States, the central Chilean Andes, and the Mediterranean basin. A large amount of studies in the western United States form a strong scientific basis for other Mediterranean mountain regions. We found that: (1) the persistence of snow cover is highly variable in space and time but mainly controlled by elevation and precipitation; (2) the snowmelt is driven by radiative fluxes, but the contribution of heat fluxes is stronger at the end of the snow season and during heat waves and rain-on-snow events; (3) the snow densification rates are higher in these regions when compared to other climate regions; and (4) the snow sublimation is an important component of snow ablation, especially in high-elevation regions. Among the pressing issues is the lack of continuous ground observation in high-elevation regions. However, a few years of snow depth (HS) and snow water equivalent (SWE) data can provide realistic information on snowpack variability. A better spatial characterization of snow cover can be achieved by combining ground observations with remotely sensed snow data. SWE reconstruction using satellite snow cover area and a melt model provides reasonable information that is suitable for hydrological applications. Further advances in our understanding of the snow processes in Mediterranean snow-dominated basins will be achieved by finer and more accurate representation of the climate forcing. While the theory on the snowpack energy and mass balance is now well established, the connections between the snow cover and the water resources involve complex interactions with the sub-surface processes, which demand future investigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:40:15","2018-01-19 23:40:15","","374-396","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Snow; United States; Water management; Water resources; satellite data; snowpack; Climatology; remote sensing; Chile; literature review; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; Landforms; Population statistics; Mediterranean climates; Mediterranean environment; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Andes; climate forcing; snow cover; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; snow; mountain region; headwater; Water management strategies; Snow hydrology; glacier mass balance; Mediterranean mountains; Mountain hydrology; Snowpack; Spatial characterization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six Early Warning Systems (EWS) based on contrasted forecasting systems are constructed to investigate how the quantification of uncertainties affects the quality of a decision. These systems differ by the location of the sources of uncertainty, and the total amount of uncertainty they take into account in the forecasting process. They are assessed with the Relative Economic Value (REV), which is a flexible measure to quantify the potential economic benefits of an EWS. The results show that all systems provide a gain over the case where no EWS is used. The most complex systems, i.e. those that consider more sources of uncertainty in the forecasting process, are those that showed the most reduced expected damages.

This paper aims to investigate and compare the capability of four nonstationary hydrologic design strategies, including the expected number of exceedances (ENE), design life level (DLL), equivalent reliability (ER), and average design life level (ADLL), with the last three methods taking into consideration the design life of the project. The confidence intervals of the calculated design floods were also estimated using the nonstationary bootstrap approach. A comparison of these four methods was performed using the annual maximum flood series (AMFS) of the Weihe River basin, Jinghe River basin, and Assunpink Creek basin. The results indicated that ENE, ER and ADLL yielded the same or very similar design values and confidence intervals for both increasing and decreasing trends of AMFS considered. DLL also yields similar design values if the relationship between DLL and ER/ADLL return periods is considered. Both ER and ADLL are recommended for practical use as they have associated design floods with the design life period of projects and yield reasonable design quantiles and confidence intervals. Furthermore, by assuming that the design results using either a stationary or nonstationary hydrologic design strategy should have the same reliability, the ER method enables us to solve the nonstationary hydrologic design problems by adopting the stationary design reliability, thus bridging the gap between stationary and nonstationary design criteria. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:40:39","2018-01-19 23:40:39","","132-150","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; Water resources management; Flood frequency analysis; Statistical methods; design method; Floods; Flood control; comparative study; Watersheds; hydrological change; river basin; experimental design; flood; reliability analysis; Reliability; confidence interval; Confidence interval; Hydrologic design; Changing environment; Reliability analysis; Design life; Delay lock loops; Design-reliability; Expected number of exceedances; Jing River; Wei River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study was conducted in an Israeli Mediterranean coastal aquifer, which includes a sandy phreatic unit and two confined calcareous sandstone units. The geological description is based on 52 wells, from which 33 samples were collected for stable isotope analysis and 25 samples for organic and inorganic parameters. Hydraulic head and chemical measurements suggest that there is an hydraulic connection between the fish ponds above the aquifer and the phreatic unit, whereas the connection with the confined units is very limited. The phreatic unit is characterized by a low concentration of oxygen and high concentrations of ammonium and phosphate, while the confined units are characterized by higher oxygen and much lower ammonium and phosphate concentrations. Organic matter fluorescence was found to be a tool to distinguish the contribution of the pond waters, whereby a pond water signature (characterized by proteinaceous (tryptophan-like) and typical humic-matter fluorescence) was found in the phreatic aquifer. The phreatic unit is also isotopically enriched, similar to pond waters, with δ18O of −1‰ and δD of −4.6‰, indicating enhanced evaporation of the pond water before infiltration, whereas there is a depleted isotopic composition in the confined units (δ18O = −4.3‰, δD = −20.4‰), which are also OM-poor. The Phreeqc model was used for quantitative calculation of the effect of pond losses on the different units. The Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) in the upper unit increases downstream from the ponds toward the sea, probably due to organic matter degradation, suggesting contribution of DIN from shallow groundwater flow to the sea. 87Sr/86Sr and Mg/Ca in the brackish and saline groundwater of the lower confined units increase toward seawater value, suggesting that the salinization process in the region is connected to seawater intrusion and not to old brine from the underlying Cretaceous aquitard. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:40:56","2018-01-19 23:40:56","","768-783","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; groundwater; Fish; water quality; Groundwater flow; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Seawater; infiltration; groundwater flow; Lakes; Biogeochemistry; Reservoirs (water); Isotopes; stable isotope; Groundwater geochemistry; isotopic composition; Biological materials; dissolved organic matter; Organic compounds; coastal aquifer; oxygen isotope; Israel; pond; salinization; Underground reservoirs; confined aquifer; Ponds; ammonium; Dissolved inorganic nitrogens; Fluorescence; Amino acids; Seawater effects; Stable-isotope analysis; Fish ponds; Organic matter degradations; Organic matter fluorescences; phosphate; Phosphate concentration; Quantitative calculation; Salinization; Specific dissolve organic mater; strontium isotope","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper considers the offshore directed flow of fresh groundwater in the unconfined and confined aquifers along the coast of the Western Netherlands. Salinity patterns based on hydrological, geological, and geophysical field data are presented in five shore-normal hydrogeological cross-sections, extending from the beach to 4 km inland. The offshore continuation of the fresh groundwater is discussed using analytical models and cone penetration tests (CPTs) performed at the beach. All CPTs taken around the low water line of the intertidal zone reveal that changes from saline to fresh groundwater are always associated with a low-permeable layer. Such a low-permeable layer, which can be as thin as a few decimetres, may form the confining layer between the unconfined and confined aquifers, or can occur within of the unconfined aquifer. Due to its high vertical resolution, a CPT is an effective method to detect these variations in salinity and lithology. At each of the investigated locations, freshwater was present in the confined aquifer. Assuming that this fresh groundwater is part of an active flow system, the submarine freshwater tongue is estimated to extend at least a few hundred meters offshore, based on analytical model calculations. Hydrochemical data from an old offshore borehole, however, suggest this may be an underestimate and that the submarine freshwater tongue originates from former times when the coastline was located further westward than nowadays. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:41:11","2018-01-19 23:41:11","","756-767","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","discharge; groundwater; hydrological cycle; Hydrogeology; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Salt water intrusion; salinity; Water; Netherlands; groundwater flow; coastal zone; Saline water; Hydrological cycles; Lithology; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Unconfined aquifers; Submarine groundwater discharge; Submarines; Hydrochemical data; confined aquifer; intertidal environment; Analytical models; Beaches; Groundwater salinities; Analytical model calculations; cone penetration test; Cone penetration tests; freshwater input; High vertical resolution; inland sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different time-lags between sea level fluctuations and hydraulic head and salinity fluctuations were detected for the FSI and the GWL. At the FSI, the time-lag of hydraulic head behind the sea level is much shorter than the lag of the salinity at the same point. Surprisingly, similar time-lags behind the sea level were measured for both the hydraulic head at the GWL and the salinity at the FSI, both at the same distance from the shoreline. Results from a numerical model, simulating the flow and transport processes at the field scale, agree with field measurements. In both, the GWL and the salinity in the FSI fluctuate almost simultaneously, while the hydraulic head in the FSI reacts faster to sea level fluctuations. The actual movement of the fresh water body, which is controlled by the unsaturated flow in the capillary fringe (‘capillary effect’), lags behind the pressure head fluctuations in the deeper parts of the aquifer, which is controlled by saturated parameters of the aquifer. The overall results agree with the conceptual mechanism suggested by Levanon et al. (2016), in which the effect of sea tide on the coastal groundwater system comprises two main processes: (1) tidal fluctuations at the sea floor boundary which cause pressure wave propagation into the aquifer, and (2) attenuation at the GWL due to the capillary effect which control also the change in the salinity and the actual movement of the FSI. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:41:21","2018-01-19 23:41:21","","665-675","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; Mediterranean Sea; Hydrogeology; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical model; field method; salinity; Sea level; sea level change; groundwater flow; water level; Saline water; estuarine front; Groundwater dynamics; unsaturated flow; groundwater-surface water interaction; coastal aquifer; Numerical models; unconfined aquifer; Israel; hydraulic head; Wave propagation; Groundwater level fluctuation; Pressure effects; Coastal aquifers; Field monitoring; Sea tides; Water interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, 500 m resolution MODIS daily snow cover products from 2000 to 2014 were adopted to analyze the status in Hengduan Mountains. In order to solve the spatial discontinuity caused by clouds in the products, we propose an adaptive spatio-temporal weighted method (ASTWM), which is based on the initial result of a Terra and Aqua combination. This novel method simultaneously considers the temporal and spatial correlations of the snow cover. The simulated experiments indicate that ASTWM removes clouds completely, with a robust overall accuracy (OA) of above 93% under different cloud fractions. The spatio-temporal variability of snow cover in the Hengduan Mountains was investigated with two indices: snow cover days (SCD) and snow fraction. The results reveal that the annual SCD gradually increases and the coefficient of variation (CV) decreases with elevation. The pixel-wise trends of SCD first rise and then drop in most areas. Moreover, intense intra-annual variability of the snow fraction occurs from October to March, during which time there is abundant snow cover. The inter-annual variability, which mainly occurs in high elevation areas, shows an increasing trend before 2004/2005 and a decreasing trend after 2004/2005. In addition, the snow fraction responds to the two climate factors of air temperature and precipitation. For the intra-annual variability, when the air temperature and precipitation decrease, the snow cover increases. Besides, precipitation plays a more important role in the inter-annual variability of snow cover than temperature. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:41:33","2018-01-19 23:41:33","","314-327","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Snow; Ecology; spatiotemporal analysis; numerical method; environmental monitoring; spectral resolution; accuracy assessment; experimental study; Landforms; annual variation; MODIS; Atmospheric temperature; snow cover; Radiometers; Aqua (satellite); pixel; Terra (satellite); Snow covers; Cloud removal; Hengduan Mountains; Weighted method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Temporal features of streamflow variability at 10 different timescales, ranging from 6 days to 8.4 years, are revealed with the Haar wavelet transform. The principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to categorize the headwater catchments with the coherent modes of multi-scale wavelet spectra.

The simulations were conducted by using a numerical model BIOMARUN, which coupled a multi-Monod kinetic model BIOB to a density-dependent variably saturated groundwater flow model MARUN. The fate and transport of the contaminant plume were characterized by computing its centroid trajectory, spreading area and percentage of biodegradation in beach saturated and unsaturated zone, respectively. Key factors likely affecting this process were investigated, including tide amplitude, capillarity and hydraulic conductivity. It was found that aerobic biodegradation was the major fate of the contaminant plume in the beach. Tidal action twisted the centroid of the contaminant plume during its migration in the beach, which increased the residence time of the plume in the beach. High tidal range significantly altered the spatial distribution of the contaminant biodegradation in the beach. In contrast, the capillary fringe had impacts on the percentage of benzene biodegraded in the saturated and unsaturated zone of the beach. The increase in capillary fringe enhanced the percentage of the contaminant biodegraded in the unsaturated zone, up to 40%, which is comparable to that in the saturated zone. Hydraulic conductivity seemed to have large impacts on the biodegradation rate of the contaminant in the beach. Higher hydraulic conductivity induced faster contaminant biodegradation in the beach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:42:18","2018-01-19 23:42:18","","793-803","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical model; spatial distribution; Biodegradation; groundwater flow; vadose zone; coastal zone; biodegradation; hydraulic conductivity; capillarity; Tides; coastal aquifer; Groundwater Flow Model; Numerical models; oxic conditions; Hydraulic conductivity; phreatic zone; Variably saturated; Capillarity; Residence time distribution; Beaches; tide; Aerobic biodegradation; benzene; Benzene; Benzene and Toluene; Biodegradation rate; BIOMARUN; Coastal beaches; Monod Kinetic model; toluene; Toluene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Major ions during 2004–2014 were determined using stoichiometry to explore their shifts and the driving factors in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Results show significant differences in monthly, spatial and annual concentrations of major ions. Waters are controlled by carbonate weathering with the dominant ions of Ca2+ and HCO3− total contributing 74% to the solutes, which are consistent with regional geography. Carbonate dissolution was produced by sulfuric acid and carbonic acid in particular. The relative abundance of Ca2+ gradually decreases, Na+ + K+ abundance, however, has doubled in the recent 11 years. Population and human activities were the major drivers for several major ions, i.e., Cl− and Na+ concentrations were explained by population and GDP, and SO42− by GDP, industrial sewage and energy consumption.

If floods could be accurately forecasted in advance, then their negative impacts could be greatly minimized. It is widely recognized that quantification and reduction of uncertainty associated with the hydrologic forecast is of great importance for flood estimation and rational decision making. Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) offers an ideal theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be developed for probabilistic flood forecasting via any deterministic hydrologic model. It provides suitable theoretical structure, empirically validated models and reasonable analytic-numerical computation method, and can be developed into various Bayesian forecasting approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive review on Bayesian forecasting approaches applied in flood forecasting from 1999 till now. The review starts with an overview of fundamentals of BFS and recent advances in BFS, followed with BFS application in river stage forecasting and real-time flood forecasting, then move to a critical analysis by evaluating advantages and limitations of Bayesian forecasting methods and other predictive uncertainty assessment approaches in flood forecasting, and finally discusses the future research direction in Bayesian flood forecasting. Results show that the Bayesian flood forecasting approach is an effective and advanced way for flood estimation, it considers all sources of uncertainties and produces a predictive distribution of the river stage, river discharge or runoff, thus gives more accurate and reliable flood forecasts. Some emerging Bayesian forecasting methods (e.g. ensemble Bayesian forecasting system, Bayesian multi-model combination) were shown to overcome limitations of single model or fixed model weight and effectively reduce predictive uncertainty. In recent years, various Bayesian flood forecasting approaches have been developed and widely applied, but there is still room for improvements. Future research in the context of Bayesian flood forecasting should be on assimilation of various sources of newly available information and improvement of predictive performance assessment methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:42:42","2018-01-19 23:42:42","","340-351","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Disasters; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian analysis; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; runoff; decision making; numerical method; literature review; uncertainty analysis; model validation; Numerical methods; Probability distributions; flood forecasting; Uncertainty quantifications; probability density function; Probability density function; Predictive distributions; Probability; stage-discharge relationship; critical analysis; Bayesian forecasting; Flood forecast; Predictive density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An alternative method to select soil moisture measurement points was developed to adequately represent immediate soil moisture response patterns to sequential rainfall events. To address the seasonal features of rainfall events and their impacts on soil moisture redistribution along the hillslope, field soil moisture data were collected at 49 points for three seasons over periods of 25 days with bi-hourly monitoring intervals. For effective characterization of soil moisture variation, soil moisture datasets were classified using cluster analysis based on Euclidean similarity.

The extent of this problem is dictated by the amount of immobile oil available for mass transfer into the water flowing through the sediment pores. An understanding of multiphase (oil and water) flow in the sediment, including oil trapping by hysteretic drainage and imbibition, is important for the development of spill response and risk assessment strategies. Therefore, the objective of this study was to measure capillary pressure-saturation (Pc-Sw) relationships for dilbit and water, and air and water in gravel using a custom-made pressure cell. The Pc-Sw relationships obtained using standard procedures in coarse porous media are height-averaged and often require correction. By developing and comparing air-water and dilbit-water Pc-Sw curves, it was found that correction was less important in dilbit-water systems due to the smaller difference in density between the fluids. In both systems, small displacement pressures were needed for the entry of non-wetting fluid in gravel. Approximately 14% of the pore space was occupied by trapped dilbit after imbibition, which can serve as a source of long-term contamination. While air-water data can be scaled to reasonably predict dilbit-water behaviour, it cannot be used to determine the trapped amount. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:43:07","2018-01-19 23:43:07","","306-313","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Sediments; risk assessment; environmental fate; drainage network; Air; river bed; mass transfer; Mass transfer; Gravel; pore space; saturation; Porous materials; Capillarity; Capillary flow; capillary pressure; Capillary tubes; Wetting; oil spill; Oil spills; sediment pollution; submergence; imbibition; bitumen; Assessment strategies; Bituminous materials; Capillary pressure-saturation relationship; Diluted bitumen; Environmental fate; Non-wetting fluids; Pipeline accidents; pipeline protection; Small displacement; Standard procedures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Group method of data handling (GMDH), which finds an approximate relationship between a set of input and output variables, not only provide an explicit procedure to select the most essential PTF input variables, but also results in more accurate and reliable estimates than other mostly applied methodologies. Therefore, the current research was aimed to apply GMDH in comparison with multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) to develop several PTFs to predict soil cumulative infiltration point-basely at specific time intervals (0.5–45 min) using soil readily available characteristics (RACs). In this regard, soil infiltration curves as well as several soil RACs including soil primary particles (clay (CC), silt (Si), and sand (Sa)), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), bulk (Db) and particle (Dp) densities, organic carbon (OC), wet-aggregate stability (WAS), electrical conductivity (EC), and soil antecedent (θi) and field saturated (θfs) water contents were measured at 134 different points in Lighvan watershed, northwest of Iran. Then, applying GMDH, MLR, and ANN methodologies, several PTFs have been developed to predict cumulative infiltrations using two sets of selected soil RACs including and excluding Ks. According to the test data, results showed that developed PTFs by GMDH and MLR procedures using all soil RACs including Ks resulted in more accurate (with E values of 0.673–0.963) and reliable (with CV values lower than 11 percent) predictions of cumulative infiltrations at different specific time steps. In contrast, ANN procedure had lower accuracy (with E values of 0.356–0.890) and reliability (with CV values up to 50 percent) compared to GMDH and MLR. The results also revealed that Ks exclusion from input variables list caused around 30 percent decrease in PTFs accuracy for all applied procedures. However, it seems that Ks exclusion resulted in more practical PTFs especially in the case of GMDH network applying input variables which are less time consuming than Ks. In general, it is concluded that GMDH provides more accurate and reliable estimates of cumulative infiltration (a non-readily available characteristic of soil) with a minimum set of input variables (2–4 input variables) and can be promising strategy to model soil infiltration combining the advantages of ANN and MLR methodologies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:43:18","2018-01-19 23:43:18","","81-91","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; artificial neural network; modeling; prediction; regression analysis; Models; data processing; Forecasting; Neural networks; watershed; comparative study; Data handling; numerical method; infiltration; soil water; Soils; Carbon; organic carbon; Organic carbon; hydraulic conductivity; Infiltration; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Transfer functions; permeability; pedotransfer function; multivariate analysis; Cumulative infiltrations; Pedo-transfer functions; soil aggregate; Multivariate linear regressions; Aggregate stability; Group method of data handling; Soil permeability; Woolen and worsted yarn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper focuses on the presence and evolution of freshwater lenses below coastal dunes and highlights the existing differences between preserved natural dunes and dunes strongly affected by human intervention. The influence that multiple natural and anthropogenic factors, such as land cover, local drainage network, and beach erosion have on the presence, size and evolution of the freshwater lenses in the aquifer is quantified and discussed. The methodology includes multiple seasonal monitoring and sampling campaigns of physical (water level, salinity, and temperature) and chemical (major cations and anions) groundwater parameters. Results indicate that freshwater lenses, where existing, are limited in thickness (about 1–2 m). Proximity to drainage ditches as well as limited dune elevation and size do not allow the formation and permanent storage of large freshwater lenses in the aquifer below the dunes. The pine forest land cover, that replaced the typical bush or sand cover, intensifies evapotranspiration reducing net infiltration and freshwater storage. The cation species distribution in the water shows that a freshening process is ongoing in preserved natural sites with stable or advancing beaches, whereas a salinization process is ongoing in anthropogenic-impacted areas with strongly-fragmented dune systems. Currently, the thin freshwater lenses in the shallow Ravenna coastal aquifer are limited in space and have no relevance for irrigation or any other human activity. The dune-beach system, however, is the recharge zone of the coastal aquifer and its protection is important to reduce water and soil salinization, which in turn control the health of the whole coastal ecosystem. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:43:31","2018-01-19 23:43:31","","804-818","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; evapotranspiration; methodology; environmental factor; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Ecosystems; salinity; Water; drainage network; Water levels; anthropogenic source; Reservoirs (water); recharge; index method; coastal aquifer; dune; salinization; Emilia-Romagna; Ravenna [Emilia-Romagna]; Positive ions; Beaches; nearshore dynamics; Freshwater lens; Coastal aquifers; Salinization; freshwater input; Adriatic Coast [Italy]; beach erosion; BEX index; coniferous forest; Dunes; Ravenna [Ravenna (PRV)]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding historical baseflow characteristics with respect to climate and land use impacts is essential for effective planning and management of water resources in the Missouri River Basin (MORB). This study evaluated statistical trends in baseflow and precipitation for 99 MORB minimally disturbed watersheds during 1950–2014. Elasticity of baseflow to climate variability and agricultural land use change were quantified for the 99 studied watersheds. Baseflow was derived from daily streamflow records with a recursive digital filter method. The results showed that baseflow varied between 38 and 80% (0 and 331 mm/year) of total streamflow with an average of 60%, indicating that more than half of streamflow in the MORB is derived from baseflow. The trend analysis revealed that precipitation increased during the study period in 78 out of 99 watersheds, leading to 1–3.9% noticeable increase in baseflow for 68 of 99 watersheds. Although the changes in baseflow obtained in this study were a result of the combined effects of climate and land use change across the basin, upward trends in baseflow generally coincide with increased precipitation and agricultural land use trends in the basin. Agricultural land use increase mostly led to a 0–5.7% decrease in annual baseflow in the basin, except toward east of the basin where baseflow mostly increased with agricultural land use increase (0.1–2.0%). In general, a 1% increase in precipitation and a 1% increase in agricultural land use resulted in 1.5% increase and 0.2% decrease in baseflow, respectively, during the study period.

Although this hydrogeological conceptual model is widely accepted today within the scientific community, it is difficult to quantify the respective storage properties of each layer with an equivalent porous medium model. Based on an HRA field site, this paper attempts to quantify in a distinct manner the respective values of the specific yield (Sy) in the saprolite and the fractured layer, with the help of a deterministic hydrogeological model. The study site is the Plancoët migmatitic aquifer located in north-western Brittany, France, with piezometric data from 36 observation wells surveyed every two weeks for eight years. Whereas most of the piezometers (26) are located where the water table lies within the saprolite, thus representing the specific yield of the unconfined layer (Sy1), 10 of them are representative of the unconfined fractured layer (Sy2), due to their position where the saprolite is eroded or unsaturated. The two-layer model, based on field observations of the layer geometry, runs with the MODFLOW code. 81 values of the Sy1/Sy2 parameter sets were tested manually, as an inverse calibration was not able to calibrate these parameters. In order to calibrate the storage properties, a new quality-of-fit criterion called “AdVar” was also developed, equal to the mean squared deviation of the seasonal piezometric amplitude variation. Contrary to the variance, AdVar is able to select the best values for the specific yield in each layer. It is demonstrated that the saprolite layer is about 2.5 times more capacitive than the fractured layer, with Sy1 = 10% (7% < Sy1 < 15%) against Sy2 = 2% (1% < Sy2 < 3%), in this particular example. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:44:06","2018-01-19 23:44:06","","328-339","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Aquifers; numerical model; calibration; France; Digital storage; porous medium; quantitative analysis; water table; Hydrogeological models; water yield; piezometer; unconfined aquifer; phreatic zone; Rocks; Porous materials; fracture flow; Scientific community; Specific yield; saprolite; Amplitude variations; Bretagne; hard rock; Hard-rock aquifers; Hydrogeological conceptual model; Quality of fit; Two-layer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overexploitation of groundwater in this plain has led to water level decline and caused serious problems such as land subsidence, aquifer destruction and water quality degradation. The increasing population and agricultural development along with drought and climate change, have further increased the pressure on water resources in this region over the last years. In order to overcome such crisis, introduction of surface water into an aquifer at particular locations can be a suitable solution. A wide variety of methods have been developed to recharge groundwater, one of which is aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). One of the fundamental principles of making such systems is delineation of suitable areas based on scientific and natural facts in order to achieve relevant objectives. To that end, the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in conjunction with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was applied in this study. More specifically, nine main parameters including depth of runoff as the considered source of water, morphology of the earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, drainage and aquifer characteristics along with quality of water in the aquifer were considered as the main layers in GIS. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin was estimated through Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method. The weighted curve number for each watershed was derived through spatial intersection of land use and hydrological soil group layers. Other thematic layers were extracted from satellite images, topographical map, and other collateral data sources, then weighed according to their influence in locating process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was then used to calculate weights of individual parameters. The normalized weighted layers were then overlaid to build up the recharge potential map.

These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280 m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and factors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intrusion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geological flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwater at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone. Significant spatial variability in the extent and geometry of intrusion observed in the acquired data highlights the importance of adopting continuous subsurface characterization methods such as this one. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:44:32","2018-01-19 23:44:32","","746-755","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; Water quality; data set; water quality; water management; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater management; Groundwater resources; Land use; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Water; management practice; infiltration; spatial distribution; data interpretation; groundwater flow; complexity; California; subsurface flow; recharge; Well logging; Geology; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; tomography; coastal aquifer; pumping; Electric conductivity; Coastal aquifers; Monitoring techniques; Monterey; Monterey Bay; Resistivity imaging; seismic reflection; Seismic reflection data; Subsurface characterizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a new stochastic multi-cell lumped-parameter aquifer model that explicitly considers uncertainty in groundwater recharge. To achieve this, the multi-cell model is combined with the constrained-state formulation method. In this method, the lower and upper bounds of groundwater heads are incorporated into the mass balance equation using indicator functions. This provides expressions for the means, variances and covariances of the groundwater heads, which can be included in the constraint set in an optimization model. This method was used to formulate two separate stochastic models: (i) groundwater flow in a two-cell aquifer model with normal and non-normal distributions of groundwater recharge; and (ii) groundwater management in a multiple cell aquifer in which the differences between groundwater abstractions and water demands are minimized. The comparison between the results obtained from the proposed modeling technique with those from Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates the capability of the proposed models to approximate the means, variances and covariances. Significantly, considering covariances between the heads of adjacent cells allows a more accurate estimate of the variances of the groundwater heads. Moreover, this modeling technique requires no discretization of state variables, thus offering an efficient alternative to computationally demanding methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:44:45","2018-01-19 23:44:45","","265-277","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; groundwater; optimization; Uncertainty; Normal distribution; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; uncertainty analysis; Intelligent systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; stochasticity; Cells; Cytology; recharge; Recharging (underground waters); Computationally efficient; Constrained optimization; Groundwater Flow Model; Groundwater abstraction; Stochastic optimizations; Lumped parameter networks; Aquifer model; Constrained state; covariance analysis; Non-normal distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These networks are extensively using highly temperature sensitive dielectric sensors due to their low cost, ease of use and less power consumption. Yet there is no general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors, instead sensor or site dependent correction algorithms are employed. Such methods become ineffective at soil moisture monitoring networks with different sensor setups and those that cover diverse climatic conditions and soil types. This study attempted to develop a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in sensor type, climatic conditions and soil type without rainfall data. In this work an automated general temperature correction method was developed by adopting previously developed temperature correction algorithms using time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements to ThetaProbe ML2X, Stevens Hydra probe II and Decagon Devices EC-TM sensor measurements. The rainy day effects removal procedure from SWC data was automated by incorporating a statistical inference technique with temperature correction algorithms. The temperature correction method was evaluated using 34 stations from the International Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and another nine stations from a local soil moisture monitoring network in Mongolia. Soil moisture monitoring networks used in this study cover four major climates and six major soil types. Results indicated that the automated temperature correction algorithms developed in this study can eliminate temperature effects from dielectric sensor measurements successfully even without on-site rainfall data. Furthermore, it has been found that actual daily average of SWC has been changed due to temperature effects of dielectric sensors with a significant error factor comparable to ±1% manufacturer's accuracy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:44:56","2018-01-19 23:44:56","","203-216","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; algorithm; soil moisture; Mongolia; statistical analysis; Statistical methods; Temperature; water content; Inference engines; Automation; sensor; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; correction; Soil water content; Moisture; Moisture control; Soil moisture monitoring; Soil moisture sensors; climate conditions; Water content; Time domain reflectometry; Time domain analysis; temperature effect; cellular automaton; Dielectric devices; Dielectric sensors; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Hydra; Microwave measurement; soil type; Statistical inference; Temperature correction; Temperature sensitive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study is framed in the context of probabilistic Bayesian decision-making that is appropriate to take rational decisions on uncertain future outcomes. As opposed to the direct use of deterministic forecasts, the probabilistic forecast identifies a predictive probability density function that represents a fundamental knowledge on future occurrences. The added value of MCP-MT is the identification of the probability that a critical situation will happen within the forecast lead-time and when, more likely, it will occur. MCP-MT is thoroughly tested for both single-model and multi-model configurations at a gauged site on the Tiber River, central Italy. The stages forecasted by two operative deterministic models, STAFOM-RCM and MISDc, are considered for the study. The dataset used for the analysis consists of hourly data from 34 flood events selected on a time series of six years. MCP-MT improves over the original models’ forecasts: the peak overestimation and the rising limb delayed forecast, characterizing MISDc and STAFOM-RCM respectively, are significantly mitigated, with a reduced mean error on peak stage from 45 to 5 cm and an increased coefficient of persistence from 0.53 up to 0.75.

The results show variation in salinity (<1 ppt) of the freshwater over seasonal cycles of wet and dry (approx. 6.5–7.25 ppt), depending on the position of the halocline. The aquifer response to larger precipitation events (>95 mm) such as Hurricane Ingrid (2013) and Tropical Storm Hanna (2014) shows meteoric water mass salinity rapidly increasing (approx. 6.39 to >8.6 ppt), but these perturbations have a shorter duration (weeks and days). Wavelet analysis of the salinity record indicates seasonal mixing effects in agreement with the wet and dry periods, but also seasonal effects of tidal mixing (meteoric and marine water masses) occurring on shorter time scales (diurnal and semi-diurnal). These results demonstrate that the salinity of the freshwater lens is influenced by precipitation and turbulent mixing with the marine WM. The salinity response is scaled with precipitation; larger more intense rainfall events (>95 mm) create a larger response in terms of the magnitude and duration of the salinity perturbation (>1 ppt).

Although routine environmental investigations in the bay have been conducted since the early 1980s, evaluations of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), an important process in exchange between groundwater and coastal seawater, and its environmental impacts have never been reported. In this study, naturally occurring radon isotope (222Rn) was measured continuously at two sites (north-west and middle-east sites) and used as a tracer to estimate SGD and associated nutrient inputs into the bay. The SGD rates estimated based on the 222Rn mass balance model were, on average, 28.2 cm/d at north-west site and 30.9 cm/d at middle-east site. The large SGD rate at middle-east site may be due to the large tidal amplitude and the sandy component with high permeability in sediments. The SGD-driven nutrient fluxes, which were calculated as the product of SGD flux and the difference of nutrient concentrations between coastal groundwater and seawater, were 3.28 × 105 mol/d for dissolved nitrates (NO3–N), 5.84 × 103 mol/d for dissolved inorganic phosphorous (DIP), and 8.97 × 105 mol/d for reactive silicate (Si). These nutrient inputs are comparable to or even higher than those supplied by local rivers. In addition, these SGD-driven nutrients have a nitrogen-phosphorous ratio as high as ∼43, which may significantly affect the ecology of coastal waters and lead to frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:45:31","2018-01-19 23:45:31","","784-792","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; discharge; groundwater; Groundwater; Seawater; environmental impact; Environmental impact; coastal water; Nutrients; Isotopes; tracer; Phosphorus; Pacific Ocean; Discharge (fluid mechanics); nutrient enrichment; Submarine groundwater discharge; Submarines; mass balance; Guangdong; Silicates; algae; dissolved inorganic phosphorus; submarine; dissolved matter; Radon; Daya Bay; Mass balance model; Nutrient loading; radon isotope; Radon isotopes; silicate; South China Sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The discrete fracture network within the inner zone is represented explicitly by fracture segments. The Laplace-transform finite-difference method is used to numerically model discrete fracture network flow, with sufficient flexibility to consider arbitrary fracture geometries and conductivity distributions. Boundary-element method and line-source functions in the Laplace domain are employed to derive a semi-analytical flow solution for the two-zone system. By imposing the continuity of flux and pressure on discrete fracture surfaces, the semi-analytical two-zone system flow model and the numerical fracture flow model are coupled dynamically. The main advantage of the approach occurring in the Laplace domain is that simulation can be done with nodes only for discrete fractures and elements for boundaries and at predetermined, discrete times. Thus, stability and convergence problems caused by time discretization are avoided and the burden of gridding and computation is decreased without loss of important fracture characteristics. The model is validated by comparison with the results from an analytical solution and a fully numerical solution. Flow regime analysis shows that a two-zone system with discrete fracture network may develop six flow regimes: fracture linear flow, bilinear flow, inner zone linear flow, inner zone pseudosteady-state flow, outer zone pseudoradial flow and outer zone boundary-dominated flow. Especially, local solutions for the inner-zone linear flow have the same form with that of a finite conductivity planar fracture and can be correlated with the total length of discrete fractures and an intercept term. In the inner zone pseudosteady-state flow period, the discrete fractures, along with the boundary of the inner zone, will act as virtual closed boundaries, due to the pressure interference caused by fracture network and the mobility contrast of the two zones. The dimensionless fracture conductivity of the fracture network determines the characteristics of the bilinear flow and the inner zone linear flow. The mobility ratio, M, and storability ratio, Fs, primarily influence the flow behavior of the middle to later time. For a larger M, the ending time of the inner zone pseudosteady-state flow will be advanced and the beginning time of the outer-zone pseudoradial flow will be delayed. And the larger M also results in increasing of the values of the transient responses in these two periods. Duration of the outer-zone pseudoradial flow becomes longer, as Fs increases; the development of the outer-zone boundary-dominated flow is therefore postponed. Finally, idealization of dual-porosity model for the two zones will introduce two dips on the pressure derivatives on the log/log plot. Depending on the interporosity flow parameter, the time of the two dips varies. However, the dips are not very appreciable for the transient dual-porosity model, when the permeability of matrix system or fracture density is relatively high. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:45:44","2018-01-19 23:45:44","","453-469","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","statistical analysis; two-dimensional modeling; numerical model; analytical method; Fracture; fracture network; Porosity; Laplace transform; Laplace transforms; Conductivity distributions; Discrete fracture network; Sailing vessels; finite difference method; boundary element method; Fracture conductivities; Source functions; Flow behaviors; Fracture characteristics; Laplace domains; Stability and convergence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But few methods could correctly relate river health to e-flows assessment at the catchment scale when they are applied to rivers highly impacted by human activities. An effective method is presented in this study to closely link river health to e-flows assessment for rivers at the catchment scale. Key fish species, as indicators of ecosystem health, were selected by using the foodweb model. A multi-species-based habitat suitability model (MHSI) was improved, and coupled with dominance of the key fish species as well as the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) to enhance its accuracy in determining the fish-preferred key hydrologic habitat variables related to ecosystem health. Taking 5964 fish samples and concurrent hydrological habitat variables as the basis, the combination of key variables of flow-velocity and water-depth were determined and used to drive the Adapted Ecological Hydraulic Radius Approach (AEHRA) to study e-flows in a Chinese urban river impacted by intensive human activities. Results showed that upstream urbanization resulted in abnormal river-course geomorphology and consequently abnormal e-flows under intensive human activities. Selection of key species based on the foodweb and trophic levels of aquatic ecosystems can reflect a comprehensive requirement on e-flows of the whole aquatic ecosystem, which greatly increases its potential to be used as a guidance tool for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems at large spatial scales. These findings have significant ramifications for catchment e-flows assessment under intensive human activities and for river ecohealth restoration in such rivers globally. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:45:52","2018-01-19 23:45:52","","470-483","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; catchment; streamflow; urbanization; Fish; water management; Health risks; Ecology; Environmental flow; Rivers; hydrological modeling; water resource; Ecosystems; Aquatic ecosystems; biodiversity; Biodiversity; food web; Water conservation; Catchments; urban area; Human resource management; geomorphology; bioindicator; ecosystem health; Health; human activity; sustainable development; trophic level; environmental restoration; Degraded ecosystems; Habitat suitability; Habitat suitability model; Habitat variables; Index of biological integrities; River health; Sustainable water resources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, temporal dynamics of GW-SW interaction were investigated under climate change. A case study was chosen for a study area along the Kiskatinaw River in Mainstem sub-watershed of the Kiskatinaw River Watershed, British Columbia, Canada. A physically based and distributed GW-SW interaction model, Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis (GSSHA), was used. Two different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (i.e., A2: heterogeneous world with self-reliance and preservation of local identities, and B1: more integrated and environmental friendly world) of SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) from Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were used for climate change study for 2020–2040. The simulation results showed that climate change influences significantly the temporal patterns of GW-SW interaction by generating variable temporal mean groundwater contributions to streamflow. Due to precipitation variability, these contributions varied monthly, seasonally, and annually. The mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020–2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to be 74.5% (σ = 2%) and 75.6% (σ = 3%), respectively. As compared to that during the base modeling period (2007–2011), the mean annual groundwater contribution to streamflow during 2020–2040 under the A2 and B1 scenarios is expected to decrease by 5.5% and 4.4%, respectively, due to the increased precipitation (on average 6.7% in the A2 and 4.8% in the B1 scenarios) and temperature (on average 0.83 °C in the A2 and 0.64 °C in the B1 scenarios).

Watershed technology is suitable to protect and enhance soil fertility, which is deteriorating at an alarming rate with agricultural intensification in high as well as low rainfall regions. Of late, WSM is considered as an effective poverty alleviation intervention in the rain fed regions in countries like India. This paper aims at providing a basic watershed policy and implementation framework based on a critical review of experiences of WSM initiatives across South Asia. The purpose is to provide cross learnings within South Asia and other developing countries (especially Africa) that are embarking on WSM in recent years. Countries in the region accord differential policy priority and are at different levels of institutional arrangements for implementing WSM programmes. The implementation of watershed interventions is neither scientific nor comprehensive in all the countries limiting the effectiveness (impacts). Implementation of the programmes for enhancing the livelihoods of the communities need to strengthen both technical and institutional aspects. While countries like India and Nepal are yet to strengthen the technical aspects in terms of integrating hydrogeology and biophysical aspects into watershed design, others need to look at these aspects as they move towards strengthening the watershed institutions. Another important challenge in all the countries is regarding the distribution of benefits. Due to the existing property rights in land and water resources coupled with the agrarian structure and uneven distribution and geometry of aquifers access to sub-surface water resources is unevenly distributed across households. Though most of the countries are moving towards incorporating livelihoods components in order to ensure benefits to all sections of the community, not much is done in terms of addressing the equity aspects of WSM. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:46:17","2018-01-19 23:46:17","","4-13","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climatic conditions; Rain; Water management; Water resources; water planning; Africa; property rights; Hydrogeology; Developing countries; water management; hydrogeology; Aquifers; Groundwater; water resource; Agriculture; Watersheds; Water conservation; poverty alleviation; Hydrology; Surface waters; basin management; socioeconomic impact; Societies and institutions; Soil conservation; India; Surface water resources; South Asia; Watershed management; policy implementation; agricultural intensification; Agricultural intensification; Nepal; annual review; Evolution; Institutional arrangement; Institutional aspects; research institution; Socio-economic impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By two days after the seawater flooding that occurred at the beginning of dry season, the observed salinity of water withdrawn by the island's main skimming well increased to 100% seawater concentration, but by ten days later already decreased to only 10–20% of seawater fraction. However, the damaging impact on the potability of the groundwater supply (when pumped water had concentrations above 1% seawater fraction) lasted 22 months longer. The data collected make possible analyses of the hydrologic factors that control recovery and management of the groundwater-supply quality on Roi-Namur and on similar low-lying islands. With the observed data as a guide, three-dimensional numerical-model simulation analyses reveal how recovery is controlled by the island's hydrology. These also allow evaluation of the efficacy of basic water-quality management/mitigation alternatives and elucidate how groundwater withdrawal and timing of the seawater-flooding event affect the length of recovery. Simulations show that, as might be expected, by adding surplus captured rainwater as artificial recharge, the freshwater-lens recovery period (after which potable groundwater may again be produced) can be shortened, with groundwater salinity remaining lower even during the dry season, a period during which no artificial recharge is applied. Simulations also show that the recovery period is not lengthened appreciably by groundwater withdrawals during recovery. Simulations further show that had the flooding event occurred at the start of the wet season, the recovery period would have been about 25% (5.5 months) shorter than actually occurred during the monitored flood that occurred at the dry-season start. Finally, analyses show that artificial recharge improves freshwater-lens water quality, making possible longer use of groundwater as a water supply throughout each year, even when no seawater flooding has occurred. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:46:40","2018-01-19 23:46:40","","676-688","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; Water quality; water supply; water management; Drought; Floods; flooding; concentration (composition); Groundwater; saline intrusion; Seawater; Water; Water supply; Recovery; three-dimensional modeling; Water conservation; Quality control; Quality management; Belgium; Groundwater modeling; recharge; Recharging (underground waters); Controlling factors; mitigation; groundwater abstraction; atoll; Marshall Islands; seawater; Groundwater salinities; Freshwater lens; Groundwater withdrawal; freshwater input; artificial recharge; Atoll island; Kwajalein Atoll; Namur [Belgium]; Namur [Namur (PRV)]; Seawater concentration; Three-dimensional numerical modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010–2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m3 of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010–2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub-healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub-healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub-healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state.

To address these challenges, a modified strategy was proposed in this study using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate diffuse N loads in the study catchments. Specifically, the spatial and temporal variations of CSANs caused by differences in precipitation and seasons were considered. In addition, the selection of best management practices (BMPs) was selected according to BMP performance and their seasonal characteristics in diffuse N control. The diffuse N load formed during freeze-thaw seasons accounts for approximately 50% of the annual diffuse N load. The diffuse N load discharged to rivers was higher in wet conditions than dry conditions by 127.4% and 181.5% during freeze-thaw seasons and growing seasons, respectively. The spatial distribution of CSANs was more sensitive to differences between freeze-thaw and growing seasons. Among BMPs, buffer strips (BS), no tillage (NT) and reducing N fertilizer applications (RNFA) all showed differences in their diffuse N removal efficiency under different hydrological conditions and seasons, while reforestation operations were not affected by these factors. The benefit of reforestation operations was lower in flatter areas. When areas with slopes greater than 2 degrees were reforested, the average N removal efficiency of the 1st CSAN could be as high as 82.4%. In the 2nd CSAN, the average N removal efficiency of BS was relatively constant across freeze-thaw seasons. Across growing seasons, the N removal efficiency of BS in wet years was 8%-10% higher than in dry conditions due to the lower percentage of lateral flow. The average N removal efficiency of NT was higher during freeze-thaw seasons and lower during growing seasons with average values of 9.3% and 6.1%, respectively. The N control efficiency of RNFA 10% and RNFA 20% (a 10% or 20% reduction in fertilizer application, respectively) was highest during dry growing seasons with average N control efficiencies of 9.6% and 17.8%, respectively.

The operation of dams reduces the streamflow in wet seasons and increases the streamflow in dry seasons, resulting in a unique seasonal variation in the streamflow based on eco-flow metrics in the Chiang Saen gauging station, observed from 2010 to 2014. In addition, the maximum flow values decreased significantly in the Chiang Saen gauging station during the year corresponding to the completion of the upstream dams. The construction and operation of dams clearly have significant impacts on low pulse duration. It is observed that climate change dictated the changes in the annual streamflow during the transition period 1992–2009 (82.28%), whereas human activities contributed more in the post-impact period 2010–2014 (61.88%). The results of this study could provide a reference for reservoir operation in the upstream regions considering both ecological and economic benefits of such operations, as well as maximize the interests of stakeholders in this region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:47:16","2018-01-19 23:47:16","","217-232","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Dams; Reservoir operation; reservoir; river flow; streamflow; climate change; Rivers; seasonal variation; human activity; Thailand; Stream flow; dam construction; hydrological regime; Seasonal variation; Indicators of hydrologic alteration (iha); Yunnan; Chiang Rai; Chiang Saen; Eco-flow metrics; Ecological and economic; Mekong Basin; Mekong river basins; Northern Region [Thailand]; thermal alteration; Trans-boundary rivers; Transition period; Xiaowan Dam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we assessed the ability of various PET models in capturing long-term (typically 2003–2011) dynamics of evaporative demand at eight ecosystems across various biomes and climatic regimes in China. Prior to assessing PET dynamics, we first examined the reasonability of fourteen PET models in representing the magnitudes of evaporative demand using eddy-covariance actual evapotranspiration (AET) as an indicator. Results showed that the robustness of the fourteen PET models differed somewhat across the sites, and only three PET models could produce reasonable magnitudes of evaporative demand (i.e., PET ≥ AET on average) for all eight sites, including the: (i) Penman; (ii) Priestly-Taylor and (iii) Linacre models. Then, we assessed the ability of these three PET models in capturing dynamics of evaporative demand by comparing the annual and seasonal trends in PET against the equivalent trends in AET and precipitation (P) for particular sites. Results indicated that nearly all the three PET models could faithfully reproduce the dynamics in evaporative demand for the energy-limited conditions at both annual and seasonal scales, while only the Penman and Linacre models could represent dynamics in evaporative demand for the water-limited conditions. However, the Linacre model was unable to reproduce the seasonal switches between water- and energy-limited states for some sites. Our findings demonstrated that the choice of PET models would be essential for the evaporative demand analyses and other related hydrological analyses at different temporal and spatial scales. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:47:31","2018-01-19 23:47:31","","1-3","","","551","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; Penman; evaporation; potential evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; assessment method; precipitation (climatology); Dynamics; Actual evapotranspiration; Potential evapotranspiration; flux measurement; Penman-Monteith equation; Evaporative demands; biome; Linacre; Priestly-Taylor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complication arises from the cross-correlation between these environmental variables. Therefore, there is still a poor understanding on the controls of root zone SWC dynamics due, in part, to a lack of an appropriate method to untangle the controls. The objective of this study was to reveal the dominant controls of root zone soil water dynamics in a small watershed using an appropriate method based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF). For this purpose, SWC of 0–0.8 m layer in a small watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau was used. The space-variant temporal anomaly (Rtn) of SWC, which is responsible for the spatial variability of soil water dynamics, was decomposed using the EOF. Results indicated that 86% of the total variations of Rtn were explained by three significant spatial structures (EOFs). Sand content and grass yield dominated the EOF1 of Rtn and elevation and aspect dominated EOF2 and EOF3 of Rtn, respectively. Moreover, their effects on soil water dynamics were time-dependent. The EOF analysis showed that three independent groups of factors (i.e., soil and vegetation dominated earth surface condition, elevation related near surface air humidity, and aspect regulated energy input) may drive the variability in soil water dynamics. Traditional correlation analysis, however, indicated that SWC was greater at higher elevation and sun-facing slopes, which distorted the soil water dynamics controls. Although original SWC-based partial correlation basically supported our findings, the results highly depended on the controlling factors selected. This study implied that Rtn rather than original SWC should be preferred for understanding soil water dynamics controls. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:47:57","2018-01-19 23:47:57","","47-55","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Correlation analysis; soil moisture; topography; environmental factor; temporal analysis; water content; watershed; Watersheds; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; spatial variation; Topography; Dynamics; Empirical Orthogonal Function; empirical orthogonal function analysis; Orthogonal functions; Loess Plateau; rhizosphere; Spatial variability; Correlation methods; Controlling factors; Environmental variables; Humidity control; Environmental control; Chinese Loess Plateau; Temporal stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent studies have demonstrated that alternative forms of active SWI show distinctly different characteristics, to the degree that the term “active SWI” may be misleading without additional qualification. In response, this article proposes to modify hydrogeology lexicon by defining and characterizing three classes of SWI, namely passive SWI, passive-active SWI and active SWI. The threshold parameter combinations for the onset of each form of SWI are developed using sharp-interface, steady-state analytical solutions. Numerical simulation is then applied to a hypothetical case study to test the developed theory and to provide additional insights into dispersive SWI behavior. The results indicate that the three classes of SWI are readily predictable, with the exception of active SWI occurring in the presence of distributed recharge. The key characteristics of each SWI class are described to distinguish their most defining features. For example, active SWI occurring in aquifers receiving distributed recharge only creates watertable salinization downstream of the groundwater mound and only where dispersion effects are significant. The revised classification of SWI proposed in this article, along with the analysis of thresholds and SWI characteristics, provides coastal aquifer custodians with an improved basis upon which to expect salinization mechanisms to impact freshwater availability following aquifer depletion. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:48:19","2018-01-19 23:48:19","","619-631","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; numerical model; Water; analytical method; groundwater flow; recharge; water table; Recharging (underground waters); Groundwater geochemistry; Interface states; coastal aquifer; Numerical models; salinization; Threshold parameters; steady-state equilibrium; Freshwater lens; Coastal aquifers; freshwater input; Dispersion effect; Ground-water mound; Key characteristics; Sharp interface; Steady state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the complex nature of these interactions, combined with limited stakeholder engagement, hinders the incorporation of socio-economic components into physical models.

A stepwise process to quantify the GBSDM is presented, along with governing equations and model assumptions. Sub-modules of the GBSDM, describing agricultural, economic, water and farm management factors, are linked together with feedbacks and finally coupled with the physically based SAHYSMOD model through commonly used tools (i.e., MS Excel and a Python script). The overall integrated model (GBSDM-SAHYSMOD) can be used to help facilitate the role of stakeholders with limited expertise and resources in model and policy development and implementation. Following the development of the integrated model, a testing methodology was used to validate the structure and behavior of the integrated model. Model robustness under different operating conditions was also assessed. The model structure was able to produce anticipated real behaviours under the tested scenarios, from which it can be concluded that the formulated structures generate the right behaviour for the right reasons. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:48:40","2018-01-19 23:48:40","","596-618","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; sustainability; water management; Economics; Model coupling; salinity; Soil salinity; stakeholder; System theory; participatory approach; Stakeholders; sustainable development; SAHYSMOD; socioeconomic indicator; policy development; policy implementation; System dynamics model; physical method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The knowledge from the literature is biased towards tropical atoll environments, and only few studies specifically investigated the effect of density-driven downward flow, even though its importance is widely acknowledged. The present study is based on previously unpublished hydrochemical data collected on the island of Baltrum following a devastating storm in 1962, which uniquely show the impact of seawater inundation on a freshwater lens in a siliciclastic aquifer. The field data show that about 3 kg of Cl per m2 of inundated land area, or 18 cm of seawater, infiltrated, and that elevated salinities persisted at the measurement depths of 4 and 6 m for at least 4 years, and at least for 6 years at greater depths. Numerical models support the assertion that the shape of the measured salinographs, i.e. an initial sharp rise in the salt concentration with time, followed by a continually-slowing decrease, must be attributed to density-driven salt fingering. Models that did not consider density effects fail to simulate the observed patterns. Transient recharge, model dimension and lateral flow modify the details of the simulation results, but in all models density-driven vertical flow dominates the overall system behaviour. The diminishing importance of density-driven flow at greater depths, however, in combination with slow recharge-driven flow rates prolongs flushing times, and enhances the risk of brackish-water up-coning when pumping is resumed too soon. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:48:53","2018-01-19 23:48:53","","689-702","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Floods; flooding; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; numerical model; Water; Storms; Landforms; coastal zone; Coastal zones; flood; groundwater resource; estuarine front; Salt concentration; Numerical models; Variable-density flows; Inundation; Hydrochemical data; Density driven flows; brackish water; seawater; Freshwater lens; Baltrum; East Frisian Islands; Lower Saxony; Transient recharges; Vertical transports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Table Mountain Group (TMG) Aquifer is one of the largest and most important aquifer systems in South Africa and is currently being considered as an alternative source of potable water for the City of Cape Town, a metropolis of over four million people. The TMG aquifer is a fractured rock aquifer hosted primarily in super mature sandstones, quartzites and quartz arenites. The groundwater naturally emanates from numerous springs throughout the cape region. One set of springs were examined to assess the source and residence time of the spring water. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes indicate that the spring water has not been subject to evaporation and in combination with Na/Cl ratios implies that recharge to the spring systems is via coastal precipitation. Although rainfall in the Cape is usually modelled on orographic rainfall, δ18O and δ2H values of some rainfall samples are strongly positive indicating a stratiform component as well. Comparing the spring water δ18O and δ2H values with that of local rainfall, indicates that the springs are likely derived from continuous bulk recharge over the immediate hinterland to the springs and not through large and/or heavy downpours. Noble gas concentrations, combined with tritium and radiocarbon activities indicate that the residence time of the TMG groundwater in this area is decadal in age with a probable maximum upper limit of ∼40 years. This residence time is probably a reflection of the slow flow rate through the fractured rock aquifer and hence indicates that the interconnectedness of the fractures is the most important factor controlling groundwater flow. The short residence time of the groundwater suggest that recharge to the springs and the Table Mountain Group Aquifer as a whole is vulnerable to climate change and reductions in regional precipitation. Any plans for large scale abstraction to supplement the City of Cape Town water supply would need to factor this into models of maximum sustainable yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:49:04","2018-01-19 23:49:04","","100-115","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; rainfall; sustainability; water supply; Groundwater flow; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Water supply; Landforms; California; Ground water recharge; recharge; Isotopes; stable isotope; groundwater resource; Recharging (underground waters); Abstracting; South Africa; Western Cape; hydrogen isotope; oxygen isotope; residence time; groundwater abstraction; Groundwater abstraction; Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes; hydrogeochemistry; Inert gases; fractured medium; Residence time; Stable isotopes; spring water; Springs (components); noble gas; Cape Town; Fractured rock aquifers; Maximum sustainable yields; Paarl; Table Mountain; Table mountain groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The general lack of high resolution soil moisture and evapotranspiration data makes identifying flash droughts at short-term scales (pentads or weeks) nearly impossible, particularly at the basin scale. In this study, we investigated the spatial patterns, temporal characteristics, and related mechanisms of flash droughts in a humid and subtropical basin (Gan River Basin) in China. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model can accurately reflect hydrological processes in the Gan River Basin at daily and monthly time scales; here, flash droughts were determined based on VIC outputs (soil moisture and evapotranspiration) and meteorological observations (maximum temperature and precipitation) during the growing season (March-October) from 1961 to 2013. We classified flash droughts into two categories (heat wave and precipitation deficit flash droughts) based on the formation mechanisms. Heat wave flash droughts are high temperature driven events, high temperatures (heat waves) cause evapotranspiration to increase and soil moisture to decrease rapidly. The main driver of precipitation deficit flash droughts is precipitation deficits, which cause soil moisture to drop and in turn cause evapotranspiration anomalies to decrease and temperature to increase. The northern part of the basin is apparently vulnerable to heat wave flash droughts, whereas precipitation deficit flash droughts tend to occur across the central and southern parts of the basin. Precipitation deficit flash droughts are more common than heat wave flash droughts in general. Both types of flash droughts became significantly more frequent from 1997 to 2013. These increases in both types of flash droughts are likely attributable to climate-related variables such as temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture during 1997–2013. As evidenced by our investigation of the evolution of the two types of flash droughts and the example of 2003 summer flash drought across the Gan River Basin, flash droughts can evolve into prolonged droughts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:49:16","2018-01-19 23:49:16","","162-176","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; drought; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; Climatology; Drought; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Variable infiltration capacities; infiltration; Watersheds; river basin; Soil moisture; Soils; precipitation (climatology); Moisture; subtropical region; Infiltration; Precipitation deficits; Variable infiltration capacity models; Jiangxi; growing season; Soil moisture deficits; heat wave; Gan Basin; Temporal characteristics; high temperature; Meteorological observation; Gan rivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A review of the state of knowledge of atoll island groundwater is overdue given their susceptibility to adverse impacts, and the task to address water access and sanitation issues within the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals framework before the year 2030. In this article, we review available literature to summarise the key processes, investigation techniques and management approaches of atoll island groundwater systems. Over fifty years of investigation has led to important advancements in the understanding of atoll hydrogeology, but a paucity of hydrogeological data persists on all but a small number of atoll islands. We find that the combined effects of buoyancy forces, complex geology, tides, episodic ocean events, strong climatic variability and human impacts create highly dynamic fresh groundwater lenses. Methods used to quantify freshwater availability range from simple empirical relationships to three-dimensional density-dependent models. Generic atoll island numerical models have proven popular in trying to unravel the individual factors controlling fresh groundwater lens behaviour. Major challenges face the inhabitants and custodians of atoll island aquifers, with rising anthropogenic stresses compounded by the threats of climate variability and change, sea-level rise, and some atolls already extracting freshwater at or above sustainability limits. We find that the study of atoll groundwater systems remains a critical area for further research effort to address persistent knowledge gaps, which lead to high uncertainties in water security issues for both island residents and surrounding environs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:49:28","2018-01-19 23:49:28","","819-844","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water resources; Water resources management; climate variation; Climatology; Climatic variability; hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; climate change; hydrogeology; anthropogenic effect; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; water resource; Water; research work; Sea level; sea level change; Sea level rise; Hydrology; knowledge; resource management; Sustainable development; Climate variability and change; Empirical relationships; Buoyancy; island; Atoll island; Anthropogenic stress; Density dependent models; episodic event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most LSMs have large uncertainties in their representations of eco-hydrological processes due to deficiencies in hydrological parameterizations. In this study, the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) LSM was modified with an advanced runoff generation and flow routing scheme, resulting in a new land surface-hydrology coupled model, CLM-GBHM. Both models were implemented in the Wudinghe River Basin (WRB), which is a semi-arid basin located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, China. Compared with CLM, CLM-GBHM increased the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency for daily river discharge simulation (1965–1969) from −0.03 to 0.23 and reduced the relative bias in water table depth simulations (2010–2012) from 32.4% to 13.4%. The CLM-GBHM simulations with static, remotely sensed and model-predicted vegetation conditions showed that the vegetation in the WRB began to recover in the 2000s due to the Grain for Green Program but had not reached the same level of vegetation cover as regions in natural eco-hydrological equilibrium. Compared with a simulation using remotely sensed vegetation cover, the simulation with a dynamic vegetation model that considers only climate-induced change showed a 10.3% increase in evapotranspiration, a 47.8% decrease in runoff, and a 62.7% and 71.3% deceleration in changing trend of the outlet river discharge before and after the year 2000, respectively. This result suggests that both natural and anthropogenic factors should be incorporated in dynamic vegetation models to better simulate the eco-hydrological cycle. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:49:39","2018-01-19 23:49:39","","116-131","","","551","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Runoff; Vegetation; river discharge; ecohydrology; land surface; remote sensing; climate change; Rivers; hydrological modeling; parameterization; vegetation cover; Climate models; Surface measurement; Groundwater; runoff; Model coupling; hydrological change; Remote sensing; Community land models; Hydrology; coupling; semiarid region; Dynamics; water table; Shaanxi; vegetation dynamics; Hydrological changes; Eco-hydrological models; flow regulation; Vegetation dynamics; Yellow River; Anthropogenic factors; Dynamic vegetation model; Land surface hydrology; Wudinghe Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite active SWI occurring in many locations, it has received considerably less attention than passive SWI. In this study, active SWI caused by an inland freshwater head decline (FHD) is characterised using numerical modelling of various idealised unconfined coastal aquifer settings. Relationships between key features of active SWI (e.g., interface characteristics and SWI response time-scales) and the parameters of the problem (e.g., inland FHD, freshwater-seawater density contrast, dispersivity, hydraulic conductivity, porosity and aquifer thickness) are explored for the first time. Sensitivity analyses show that the SWI response time-scales under active SWI situations are influenced by both the initial and final boundary head differences. The interface is found to be steeper under stronger advection (i.e., caused by the inland FHD), higher dispersivity and hydraulic conductivity, and lower aquifer thickness, seawater density and porosity. The interface movement is faster and the mixing zone is wider with larger hydraulic conductivity, seawater-freshwater density difference, and aquifer thickness, and with lower porosity. Dimensionless parameters (Peclet number and mixed convection ratio) from previous steady-state analyses offer only limited application to the controlling factors of passive SWI, and are not applicable to active SWI.

Ministry of Energy (MOE), Department of Environment (DOE), and National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) are three stakeholders in the groundwater bioremediation problem in Iran. Based on the preferences of these stakeholders, the multi-objective optimization model tries to minimize: (1) cost; (2) sum of contaminant concentrations that violate standard; (3) contaminant plume fragmentation. The NSGA-II multi-objective optimization method gives Pareto-optimal solutions. A compromised solution is determined using fallback bargaining with impasse to achieve a consensus among the stakeholders. In this study, two different approaches are investigated and compared based on two different domains for locations of injection and extraction wells. At the first approach, a limited number of predefined locations is considered according to previous similar studies. At the second approach, all possible points in study area are investigated to find optimal locations, arrangement, and flow rate of injection and extraction wells. Involvement of the stakeholders, investigating all possible points instead of a limited number of locations for wells, and minimizing the contaminant plume fragmentation during bioremediation are new innovations in this research. Besides, the simulation period is divided into smaller time intervals for more efficient optimization. Image processing toolbox in MATLAB® software is utilized for calculation of the third objective function. In comparison with previous studies, cost is reduced using the proposed methodology. Dispersion of the contaminant plume is reduced in both presented approaches using the third objective function. Considering all possible points in the study area for determining the optimal locations of the wells in the second approach leads to more desirable results, i.e. decreasing the contaminant concentrations to a standard level and 20% to 40% cost reduction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:50:03","2018-01-19 23:50:03","","407-422","","","551","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Disasters; Iran; optimization; software; genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; hydrological modeling; Pollution; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; stakeholder; Extraction; MATLAB; in situ measurement; Disaster prevention; Genetic algorithms; Pareto principle; Costs; Location; Image processing; groundwater pollution; Cost reduction; bioremediation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Optimal systems; pollutant; BIOPLUME III; Fallback bargaining with impasse; Groundwater bioremediation; Injection/extraction wells; NSGA-II; Stakeholder participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, new concepts and ideas about how to approach water resources management more holistically have been discussed. The emergence of concepts such as socio-hydrology indicates the growing relevance of connections between social and hydrological disciplines. In this paper, we determine how well social sciences are integrated with hydrological research by using two approaches. First, we conducted a questionnaire survey with a sample of hydrology researchers and professionals (N = 353) to explore current opinions and developments related to interdisciplinary collaboration between hydrologists and social scientists. Second, we analyzed the disciplinary composition of author teams and the reference lists of articles pertaining to the socio-hydrology concept. We conclude that interdisciplinarity in water resources research is on a promising track but may need to mature further in terms of its aims and methods of integration. We find that current literature pays little attention to the following questions: What kind of interdisciplinarity do different scholars want?

Taking three dominant desert shrubs, Haloxylon ammodendron, Nitraria tangutorum, and Calligonum mongolicum, as examples, we aim to evaluate the applicability of three transpiration models, i.e. the modified Jarvis-Stewart model (MJS), the simplified process-based model (BTA), and the artificial neural network model (ANN) at different temporal scales. The stem sap flow of each species was monitored using the stem heat balance approach over both the 2014 and 2015 main growing seasons. Concurrent environmental variables were also measured with an automatic weather station. The ANN model generally produced better simulations of Ec than the MJS and BTA models at both hourly and daily scales, indicating its advantage in solving complicated, nonlinear problems between transpiration rate and environmental driving forces. The solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit were crucial variables in modeling Ec for all three species. The performance of the MJS and ANN models was significantly improved by incorporating root-zone soil moisture. We also found that the difference between hourly and daily fitted parameter values was considerable for the MJS and BTA models. Therefore, these models need to be recalibrated when applied at different temporal scales.

The goal of our study was to develop an approach for characterizing the effects of hydropower plant operations on within-day flow regimes across multiple dams and rivers. For this aim we first defined ecologically meaningful metrics that provide a full representation of the flow regime at short time scales from free-flowing rivers and rivers exposed to hydropeaking. We then defined metrics that enable quantification of the deviation of the altered short-term flow regime variables from those of the unaltered state. The approach was successfully tested in two rivers in northern Sweden, one free-flowing and another regulated by cascades of hydropower plants, which were additionally classified based on their impact on short-term flows in sites of similar management. The largest differences between study sites corresponded to metrics describing sub-daily flow magnitudes such as amplitude (i.e., difference between the highest and the lowest hourly flows) and rates (i.e., rise and fall rates of hourly flows). They were closely followed by frequency-related metrics accounting for the numbers of within-day hourly flow patterns (i.e., rises, falls and periods of stability of hourly flows). In comparison, between-site differences for the duration-related metrics were smallest. In general, hydropeaking resulted in higher within-day flow amplitudes and rates and more but shorter periods of a similar hourly flow patterns per day. The impacted flow feature and the characteristics of the impact (i.e., intensity and whether the impact increases or decreases whatever is being described by the metric) varied with season. Our approach is useful for catchment management planning, defining environmental flow targets, prioritizing river restoration or dam reoperation efforts and contributing information for relicensing hydropower dams. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:50:40","2018-01-19 23:50:40","","186-200","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","catchment; river flow; flow pattern; Rivers; Flow patterns; Catchments; Flow of water; environmental impact assessment; Sweden; Impact assessments; demand analysis; hydroelectric power plant; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; electricity generation; Short term; Hydrological alterations; Hydrological characterization; Hydropeaking; Sub-daily flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non-availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–25, 25–45, 45–100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more.

The application of EMMA and elemental ratios allowed delimiting the end-members responsible for water quality variations at a catchment scale. The further application of MIX quantified the significant impact of AMD on the river quality; less than 10% of AMD relative contribution is enough to maintain acidic conditions during most of the year. The mixing model also provided information about the element mobility, distinguishing those elements with a quasi-conservative behavior (e.g., Cu, Zn, Al, Co or Ni) from those affected by mineral precipitation/dissolution (e.g., K, Si, Na, Sr, Ca, Fe, Pb, or As). Floods are the main driver of dissolved and, mainly particulate, contaminants in the catchment. Thus, the first rainfall events in November only accounted for 19% of the annual Meca flow but yielded between 26 and 43% of the net acidity and dissolved metal loads (mainly, Fe, As and Pb). Concerning particulate transport, around 332 tons of particulate Fe, 49 tons of Al, 0.79 tons of As and 0.37 tons of Pb were recorded during these first floods. The particulate As concentration can be up to 34 times higher than the dissolved one during floods and between 2 and 4 times higher for Fe, Pb and Cr.

This method directly relates digitally measured intensities to the water content of the porous medium. This method requires the classical image analysis steps, i.e., normalization, filtering, background subtraction, scaling and calibration. The main advantages of this approach are that no calibration experiment is needed, because calibration curve relating water content and reflected light intensities is established during the main monitoring phase of each experiment and that no tracer or dye is injected into the flow tank. The procedure enables effective processing of a large number of photographs and thus produces 2D water content maps at high temporal resolution. A drainage/imbibition experiment in a 2D flow tank with inner dimensions of 40 cm × 14 cm × 6 cm (L × W × D) is carried out to validate the methodology. The accuracy of the proposed approach is assessed using a statistical framework to perform an error analysis and numerical simulations with a state-of-the-art computational code that solves the Richards’ equation. Comparison of the cumulative mass leaving and entering the flow tank and water content maps produced by the photographic measurement technique and the numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency and high accuracy of the proposed method for investigating vadose zone flow processes.

Relying on daily hydrology and monthly-resolved partial pressure of water dissolved CO2 (pCO2), this study characterized the influence of spatiotemporal hydraulic variability on CO2 emission from confined low-gradient rivers of the Yangtze. Results indicate that unit-width-discharge (Q/w) explained well along-mainstem, inter-tributary and intra-annual (monthly) variations of key hydraulic characteristics (e.g., current velocity and water depth). CO2 flux normalized to unit water surface area (FCO2) varied closely with channel hydraulics (especially current velocity), which explained 48.9–67.9% and 68.2–72.0% of the spatial and temporal FCO2 variations, respectively, larger than the parts explained by pCO2 (32.1–51.1% and 28.0–31.8%). Despite high sensitivity of FCO2 to river hydraulics, CO2 flux normalized to unit channel length (FlCO2) depended primarily on channel discharge, which determines ultimately the amount of CO2 exported from the catchment and emitted to the atmosphere, regardless of the complex interplays among channel hydraulic characteristics.

Because of the need to simplify hydrological models, parameters are often included to help with modelling hydrological processes. Generally the parameters of lumped, semi or distributed hydrological models depend on the values estimated at a gauged location, generally at outlet of the catchment (mostly using discharge). In this approach it is hard to judge how well a model represents internal catchment processes of the hydrological cycle as well as also ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment. The purpose of the paper is to assess, and potentially improve, the ability of a physically-based semi-distributed hydrological model, TopNet, using a spatially and temporally detailed set of field measurements of catchment responses to diverse weather conditions. The TopNet rainfall-runoff model was applied to the Waipara catchment located in the South Island of New Zealand. Observations from field experiments were compared with the simulation results of uncalibrated TopNet model. The total amount of simulated runoff showed reasonable agreement with observations. However, the model overestimated baseflow and underestimated surface flow. The results show that soil moisture variation within the catchment is well represented by the model. However, comparison of the observed water balance with model results show that there is a deficiency in the calculation of evapotranspiration. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:51:40","2018-01-19 23:51:40","","1-11","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; hydrological cycle; software; New Zealand; hydrological modeling; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; comparative study; Model structures; model test; Catchments; experimental study; Hydrology; Soil moisture; Digital storage; Hydrological modelling; Rainfall-runoff modeling; Spatial heterogeneity; water budget; Distributed hydrological model; baseflow; Experimental catchments; Semi distributed hydrological models; Canterbury [South Island]; South Island; Spatial temporals; TopNet; Waipara River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, transient methods such as the integrated Hooghoudt (inH) and van Schilfgaarde (vanS) equations have seldom been implemented in models. In the present study, RZWQM2's hydrologic component was modified to initiate the soil water redistribution process when rainfall occurred.

As the injected CO2 will remain in storage for hundreds of years, the safety of CO2 geologic sequestration is a major concern. The low-permeability sandstone of the Ordos Basin in China is regarded as both caprock and reservoir rock, so understanding the breakthrough pressure and permeability of the rock is necessary. Because part of the pore volume experiences a non-wetting phase during the CO2 injection and migration process, the rock may be in an unsaturated condition. And if accidental leakage occurs, CO2 will migrate up into the unsaturated zone. In this study, breakthrough experiments were performed at various degrees of water saturation with five core samples of low-permeability sandstone obtained from the Ordos Basin. The experiments were conducted at 40 °C and pressures of &gt;8 MPa to simulate the geological conditions for CO2 sequestration. The results indicate that the degree of water saturation and the pore structure are the main factors affecting the rock breakthrough pressure and permeability, since the influence of calcite dissolution and clay mineral swelling during the saturation process is excluded. Increasing the average pore radius or most probable pore radius leads to a reduction in the breakthrough pressure and an increase by several orders of magnitude in scCO2 effective permeability. In addition, the breakthrough pressure rises and the scCO2 effective permeability decreases when the water saturation increases. However, when the average pore radius is greater than 0.151 µm, the degree of water saturation will has a little effect on the breakthrough pressure. On this foundation, if the most probable pore radius of the core sample reaches 1.760 µm, the breakthrough pressure will not be impacted by the increasing water saturation. We establish correlations between (1) the breakthrough pressure and average pore radius or most probable pore radius, (2) the breakthrough pressure and scCO2 effective permeability, (3) the breakthrough pressure and water saturation, and (4) the scCO2 effective permeability and water saturation. This study provides practical information for further studies of CO2 sequestration as well as the caprock evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:52:05","2018-01-19 23:52:05","","331-342","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; reservoir; Greenhouse gases; carbon sequestration; Reservoirs (water); Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; Ordos Basin; Sandstone; Unsaturated condition; permeability; Rocks; sandstone; Wetting; pressure; Minerals; Pore structure; magnitude; Effective permeability; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Core samples; Anthropogenic emissions; Breakthrough experiment; Breakthrough pressures; clay mineral; Geologic sequestrations; Geological conditions; Low permeability sandstone; Metamorphic rocks; swelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these methods, a given watershed is examined as a grid of cells with a particular morphologic value. A reference map is a grid of cells labeled as flood and non-flood from hydraulic modeling or remote sensing observations. By using the reference map, a threshold on morphologic feature is determined to label the unknown cells as flood and non-flood (binary classification). The main limitation of these methods is the threshold transferability assumption in which a homogenous geomorphological and hydrological behavior is assumed for the entire region and the same threshold derived from the reference map (training area) is used for other locations (ungauged watersheds) inside the study area. In order to overcome this limitation and consider the threshold variability inside a large region, regression modeling is used in this paper to predict the threshold by relating it to the watershed characteristics. Application of this approach for North Carolina shows that the threshold is related to main stream slope, average watershed elevation, and average watershed slope. By using the Fitness (F) and Correct (C) criteria of C > 0.9 and F > 0.6, results show the threshold prediction and the corresponding floodplain for 100-year design flow are comparable to that from Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) in the region. However, the floodplains from the proposed model are underpredicted and overpredicted in the flat (average watershed slope <1%) and mountainous regions (average watershed slope >20%).

The average values of soil moisture were on the order of farmland > orchard > grassland > abandoned land > shrubland > forestland. Vertical distribution characteristics of soil moisture (0–500 cm) were similar among land use types. Highly significant (p < 0.01) negative correlations were found between soil moisture and elevation (h) except for shrubland (p > 0.05), whereas no significant correlations were found between soil moisture and plan curvature (Kh), stream power index (SPI), compound topographic index (CTI) (p > 0.05), indicating that topographical attributes (mainly h) have a negative effect on the soil moisture spatial heterogeneity. Besides, soil moisture spatial heterogeneity decreased from forestland to grassland and farmland, accompanied by a decline from 15° to 1° alongside upper to lower slope position. This study highlights the importance of land use types and topographical attributes on the soil moisture spatial heterogeneity from a combined analysis of the structural equation model (SEM) and generalized additive models (GAMs), and the relative contribution of land use types to the soil moisture spatial heterogeneity was higher than that of topographical attributes, which provides insights for researches focusing on soil moisture varitions on the Loess Plateau. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:52:26","2018-01-19 23:52:26","","466-477","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; catchment; soil moisture; spatial analysis; Generalized additive model; hydrological modeling; heterogeneity; Sediments; Land use; Catchments; Forestry; Soil moisture; Soils; Landforms; Spatial heterogeneity; Soil surveys; Farms; land use; Moisture; index method; grassland; Loess Plateau; shrubland; Statistical techniques; scale effect; transect; abandoned land; Vertical distributions; Compound topographic indices; Structural equation modeling; Transect scale","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) method is a popular statistical downscaling and bias correction method developed to address this issue. The advantage of BCSD is its ability to reduce biases in the distribution of precipitation totals at the GCM scale and then introduce more realistic variability at finer scales than simpler spatial interpolation schemes. Although BCSD corrects biases at the GCM scale before disaggregation; at finer spatial scales biases are re-introduced by the assumptions made in the spatial disaggregation process. Our study focuses on this limitation of BCSD and proposes a rank-based approach that aims to reduce the spatial disaggregation bias especially for both low and high precipitation extremes. BCSD requires the specification of a multiplicative bias correction anomaly field that represents the ratio of the fine scale precipitation to the disaggregated precipitation. It is shown that there is significant temporal variation in the anomalies, which is masked when a mean anomaly field is used. This can be improved by modelling the anomalies in rank-space. Results from the application of the rank-BCSD procedure improve the match between the distributions of observed and downscaled precipitation at the fine scale compared to the original BCSD approach. Further improvements in the distribution are identified when a scaling correction to preserve mass in the disaggregation process is implemented. An assessment of the approach using a single GCM over Australia shows clear advantages especially in the simulation of particularly low and high downscaled precipitation amounts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:52:39","2018-01-19 23:52:39","","716-725","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; downscaling; evapotranspiration; interpolation; spatial analysis; climate modeling; Statistical downscaling; climate change; hydrological modeling; sampling bias; Hydrology; temporal variation; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); Bias correction; correction; Precipitation extremes; general circulation model; General circulation model; Bias-correction methods; Mathematical models; BCSD; Fine-scale precipitation; Rank-BCSD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little groundwater trading is occurring at present. Interviews were conducted with groundwater license holders and water brokers to investigate why the Victorian groundwater trade market is underdeveloped. Responses show there is a complex mix of social, economic, institutional and technical reasons. Barriers to trade are influenced by the circumstances of each groundwater user, administrative process and resource management rules. Water brokers deal with few trades at low margins and noted unrealistic selling prices and administrative difficulties. Irrigators who have successfully traded identify that there are few participants in trading, technical appraisals are expensive and administrative requirements and fees are burdensome, especially when compared to surface water trading. Opportunities to facilitate trade include groundwater management plan refinement and improved information provision. Simplifying transaction processes and costs, demonstrating good resource stewardship and preventing third party impacts from trade could address some concerns raised by market participants.

We analyze the institutional perceptions of the drivers and strategies for managing water-related risks and vulnerabilities in three regionally important river basin areas located in Finland, Mexico, and Laos. Our analysis is based on data gathered through participatory workshops and complemented by qualitative content analysis of relevant policy documents. The identified drivers and proposed risk reduction strategies showed the multidimensionality and context-specificity of water-related risks and vulnerabilities across study areas. Most of the identified drivers were seen to increase risks, but some of the drivers were positive trends, and drivers also included also policy instruments that can both increase or decrease risks. Nevertheless, all perceived drivers were not addressed with suggested risk reduction strategies. In particular, most of the risk reduction strategies were incremental adjustments, although many of the drivers classified as most important were large-scale trends, such as climate change, land use changes and increase in foreign investments. We argue that there is a scale mismatch between the identified drivers and suggested strategies, which questions the opportunity to manage the drivers by single-scale incremental adjustments.

To understand how freeze-thaw cycles affect runoff generation processes in permafrost catchments, a typical headwater catchment with continuous permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau was measured. A new approach is presented in this study to account for runoff processes on the spring thawing period and autumn freezing period, when runoff generation clearly differs from that of non-permafrost catchments. This approach introduces a soil temperature-based water saturation function and modifies the soil water storage curve with a soil temperature threshold. The results show that surface soil thawing induced saturation excess runoff and subsurface interflow account for approximately 66–86% and 14–34% of total spring runoff, respectively, and the soil temperature significantly affects the runoff generation pattern, the runoff composition and the runoff coefficient with the enlargement of the active layer. The suprapermafrost groundwater discharge decreases exponentially with active layer frozen processes during autumn runoff recession, whereas the ratio of groundwater discharge to total runoff and the direct surface runoff coefficient simultaneously increase. The bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition. The new approach could be used to further develop hydrological models of cold regions dominated by permafrost. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:53:24","2018-01-19 23:53:24","","307-317","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; catchment; discharge; Temperature; Groundwater; runoff; seasonal variation; Catchments; Soil moisture; Soils; water storage; quantitative analysis; soil temperature; Soil temperature; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Runoff generation; headwater; permafrost; Permafrost; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Seasonal dynamics; Freezing; Thawing; Headwater catchment; active layer; Quantitative approach; thawing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study evaluated and compared the spatiotemporal variations of drought characteristics and return periods within mainland China between 1961 and 2013. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Composite Index (CI) were calculated at multiple timescales, the run theory was used for objective identification and characterization of drought events while Kendall's τ method was used to analyze their dependencies. Within the univariate framework, marginal distributions of duration, severity, and peak were derived by fitting Exponential, Weibull and GDP distributions respectively and the drought return periods was investigated and mapped. Comparison of drought indices showed that SPEI and CI performed better than SPI in delineating spatial patterns of drought characteristics. This might be attributed to the temperature effect on evapotranspiration and therefore on drought index. Considering the increasing trend in reference evapotranspiration in the 21st century, the importance of utilizing temperature-based drought index is imperative. Severe and extreme droughts occurred in the late 1990s in many places in China while persistent multi-year severe droughts occurred more frequently over North China, Northeast China, Northwest China and Southwest China. The spatial patterns showed that regions characterized by higher drought severity were associated with higher drought duration. The North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China had much longer drought durations during the 1990s and 2000s. As droughts normally cover large areas, regional drought return periods has been showed to be more effective in providing support for drought management than station based drought return periods. Studies on the spatial comparability of drought return periods across mainland China have therefore been undertaken for drought mitigation and effective utilization of water resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:53:36","2018-01-19 23:53:36","","549-567","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration; Return periods; Risk assessment; Water resources; drought; evapotranspiration; performance assessment; Standardized precipitation index; Drought characteristics; Drought indices; Drought; risk assessment; spatiotemporal analysis; extreme event; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; return period; hazard management; index method; twenty first century; Weibull distribution; temperature effect; Gross Domestic Product; Objective identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a lack of hillslope-scale climate-runoff observations is limiting our ability to understand these impacts. Here, we present a 52-year (1962–2013) dataset (precipitation, temperature, snow cover, soil water content, and runoff) from three 5 ha hillslopes on the seasonally-frozen northern Great Plains. In this region, snowmelt-runoff drives c. 80% of annual runoff and is potentially vulnerable to warming temperatures and changes in precipitation amount and phase. We assessed trends in these climatological and hydrological variables using time series analysis. We found that spring snowmelt-runoff has decreased (on average by 59%) in response to a reduction in winter snowfall (by 18%), but that rainfall-runoff has shown no significant response to a 51% increase in rainfall or shifts to more multi-day rain events. In summer, unfrozen, deep, high-infiltrability soils act as a ‘shock absorber’ to rainfall, buffering the long-term runoff response to rainfall. Meanwhile, during winter and spring freshet, frozen ground limits soil infiltrability and results in runoff responses that more closely mirror the snowfall and snowmelt trends. These findings are counter to climate-runoff relationships observed at the catchment scale on the northern Great Plains where land drainage alterations dominate. At the hillslope scale, decreasing snowfall, snowmelt-runoff, and spring soil water content is causing agricultural productivity to be increasingly dependent on growing season precipitation, and will likely accentuate the impact of droughts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:53:48","2018-01-19 23:53:48","","538-548","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Runoff; Snow; Time series analysis; Water resources; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; climate change; water content; runoff; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Landforms; Climate change impact; hillslope; precipitation (climatology); climate effect; Productivity; Soil water content; drainage; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Snowmelt; Precipitation (chemical); Agricultural runoff; Great Plains; Northern great plains; growing season; Hydrological variables; frozen ground; Agricultural productivity; Hillslopes; Shock absorbers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This implies, however, the availability of methods for providing accurate estimations of flow for ungauged rivers. This study compares the potential of statistical interpolation (SI)—a simple data assimilation technique that combines observations and simulations from hydrological modelling—with four other approaches: nearest neighbour, direct use of outputs from hydrological modelling, ordinary and topological kriging. Through subsampling cross-validation analyses based on the modified Kling-Gupta efficiency indicator, we show that SI compares favourably with these other approaches. While the performance of other methods depends on the configuration of the ungauged site in regards to the neighbouring reference sites, SI is less affected by these configurations. SI outperforms the other approaches particularly where the ungauged site is relatively distant from observation sites. In these cases, SI performance depends on the performance of the background model that relies on simulations of hydrological processes forced by precipitation and temperature observations. Our findings offer the potential for heightened performance estimates through an improvement of hydrological modelling and the use of more complex assimilation techniques for exploiting the model. © 2017","2017","2018-01-19 23:53:59","2018-01-19 23:53:59","","294-306","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Kriging; Water management; interpolation; performance assessment; streamflow; data assimilation; water management; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Data assimilation; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; model validation; Hydrology; Hydrological modelling; Interpolation; kriging; estimation method; sustainable development; Stream flow; Topology; nearest neighbor analysis; Statistical interpolation; Ungauged rivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was thus to assess the robustness of three conceptual rainfall-runoff models (GR4j, HBV and IHACRES) on five basins in northern Tunisia under long-term climate variability, in the light of available future climate scenarios for this region. The robustness of the models was evaluated using a differential split sample test based on a climate classification of the observation period that simultaneously accounted for precipitation and temperature conditions. The study catchments include the main hydrographical basins in northern Tunisia, which produce most of the surface water resources in the country. A 30-year period (1970–2000) was used to capture a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions. The calibration was based on the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) criterion, while model transferability was evaluated based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion and volume error. The three hydrological models were shown to behave similarly under climate variability. The models simulated the runoff pattern better when transferred to wetter and colder conditions than to drier and warmer ones. It was shown that their robustness became unacceptable when climate conditions involved a decrease of more than 25% in annual precipitation and an increase of more than +1.75 °C in annual mean temperatures. The reduction in model robustness may be partly due to the climate dependence of some parameters. When compared to precipitation and temperature projections in the region, the limits of transferability obtained in this study are generally respected for short and middle term. For long term projections under the most pessimistic emission gas scenarios, the limits of transferability are generally not respected, which may hamper the use of conceptual models for hydrological projections in northern Tunisia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:54:12","2018-01-19 23:54:12","","201-217","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Runoff; Water resources; catchment; climate variation; rainfall-runoff modeling; surface water; Uncertainty; Climatology; Climate variability; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; calibration; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Efficiency; Rainfall - Runoff modelling; Surface waters; precipitation assessment; Surface water resources; Hepatitis B virus; Hydrographic surveys; Tunisia; Model robustness; climate classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most regions in Pacific Maritime, central Boreal regions and the Atlantic Maritime showed an increase in AMP, while a decrease in Canadian Prairies and most Boreal regions. More stations showing statistically significant increases than decreases in spring, summer and autumn SMPs were found while there was a statistically significant decrease (increase) in winter SMP over southern (northern) Canada.

Long-term historical precipitation data available for almost 100 years at 53 rain gages in south Florida, USA, with gages having varying lengths of missing data are used for the study. Precipitation data with gaps and time series with spatial interpolated data are analyzed. Chronologically complete datasets are often used in climate variability studies by analyzing data in multiple temporal windows. The temporal windows selected in this work coincide with Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) cool and warm phases that strongly influence precipitation extremes and characteristics in the study region. Selection of these windows has helped in evaluating the extremes derived based on infilled and unfilled data. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation extremes over a pre-specified threshold is also analyzed. Results indicate that infilled precipitation data introduce large biases in the statistical trends and over and under-estimate low and high extremes respectively. Evaluation of three extreme precipitation indices (i.e. Rx1day, R25mm and R50mm) indicates that bias increases with increase in amount of missing data. Nonparametric hypothesis tests indicate that statistical distributions of data of infilled and unfilled data are different when the data infilled is more than 5% of the entire data. Infilled data also introduced high variability in precipitation extremes in AMO cool and warm phases along with the changes in the frequency of occurrence of extreme events over a threshold. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:54:37","2018-01-19 23:54:37","","616-634","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation; Extreme precipitation; Rain; Trend analysis; United States; data set; time series analysis; trend analysis; statistical analysis; data assimilation; climate change; numerical method; Florida [United States]; Precipitation (meteorology); extreme event; precipitation assessment; Gages; Rain gages; long-term change; Atlantic multidecadal oscillations; Missing data; Infilling; South Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Possible influence of the infiltrative instability on differential weathering of ultramafic rocks in tropical climate is investigated here, starting from the Tiébaghi case for which a groundwater model is available. Infiltration instability is governed by non-dimensional numbers, i.e. the Damköhler and Peclet numbers, and by the permeability contrasts between the bedrock and the different layers of the weathering profile. These numbers are firstly estimated for the Tiébaghi case, and secondly a sensitivity study of the weathering style is achieved through numerical modeling. Computations are firstly carried out without the impervious laterite cover, and then the effect of this cover is considered. The characteristic time constant for weathering of peridotites is directly estimated at around 7 yrs from the thickness of the weathering front and the fluid velocity. The results show that a permeability contrast of at least 100 between the most pervious layer in the weathering front and bedrock and a diffusivity of chemical species lower than 2.5 × 10−8 m2/s are required to allow instability. The Tiébaghi case lies at the limit of instability and dissolution fingers develop in a time lapse of 1 Ma. However, this requires the infiltration of nearly 800 mm of rainfall yearly, which is not the case presently. The development of dissolution fingers is promoted by any initial pervious zone such as fracture concentration around a faulted zone and the characteristic time for instability development drops to 0.1–0.3 Ma. Extension of these results to other peridotite massifs in the tropical zone submitted to different temperatures and rainfalls is finally discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:54:49","2018-01-19 23:54:49","","268-278","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Climate models; concentration (composition); Groundwater; infiltration; Soils; Groundwater modeling; weathering; dissolution; Dissolution; Stability; Weathering; permeability; Fracture; Rocks; diffusivity; Characteristic time; Differential weathering; extensional tectonics; fault zone; Instability development; New Caledonia; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; Permeability contrasts; pseudokarst; Pseudokarst; ultramafic rock; Ultramafic rocks; weathering profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The satellite based African Rainfall Climatology Version 2 (ARC2) daily gridded rainfall estimates with a 0.1° × 0.1° spatial resolution provides the possibility for in-depth studies of seasonal changes over a 33-year period (1983–2015). Here we analyze rainfall regime variables that require daily observations: onset, cessation, and length of the wet season; seasonal rainfall amount; number of rainy days; intensity and frequency of rainfall events; number, length, and cumulative duration of dry spells. Rain gauge stations and MSWEP (Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation) data were used to evaluate the agreement of rainfall variables in both space and time, and trends were analyzed. Overall, ARC2 rainfall variables reliably show the spatio-temporal dynamics of seasonal rainfall over 33 years when compared to gauge and MSWEP data. However, a higher frequency of low rainfall events (&lt;10 mm day−1) is found for satellite estimates as compared to gauge data, which also causes disagreements between satellite and gauge based variables due to sensitivity to the number of days with observations (frequency, intensity, and dry spell characteristics). Most rainfall variables (both ARC2 and gauge data) show negative anomalies (except for onset of rainy season) from 1983 until the end of the 1990s, from which anomalies become mostly positive and inter-annual variability is higher. ARC2 data show a strong increase in seasonal rainfall, wet season length (caused by both earlier onset and a late end), number of rainy days, and high rainfall events (&gt;20 mm day−1) for the western/central Sahel over the period of analysis, whereas the opposite trend characterizes the eastern part of the Sahel. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:55:00","2018-01-19 23:55:00","","427-440","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Sahel; satellite data; software; Drought; Satellites; spatiotemporal analysis; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation assessment; diurnal variation; spatial resolution; Gages; raingauge; Spatiotemporal analysis; Rain gages; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Rain gauges; ARC2; Daily observations; Rainfall regime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Known major nitrogen (N) sources are chemical fertilizers, livestock waste, and domestic wastewater. In general, scatter diagrams of δ18O and δ15N from NO3 − can be used to identify these pollution sources. However, this method can be difficult to use for chemical fertilizers and livestock waste sources due to the overlap of δ18O and δ15N ranges. In this study, we propose to use coprostanol as an indicator for the source of pollution. Coprostanol can be used as a fecal contamination indicator because it is a major fecal sterol formed by the conversion of cholesterol by intestinal bacteria in the gut of higher animals. The proposed method was applied to investigate NO3 − pollution sources for groundwater in Shimabara, Nagasaki, Japan. Groundwater samples were collected at 33 locations from March 2013 to November 2015. These data were used to quantify relationships between NO3-N, δ15N-NO3 −, δ18O-NO3 −, and coprostanol. The results show that coprostanol has a potential for source identification of nitrate pollution. For lower coprostanol concentrations (&lt;30 ng L−1) in the nitrate-polluted group, fertilizer is likely to be the predominant source of NO3 −. However, higher concentration coprostanol samples in the nitrate-polluted group can be related to pollution from livestock waste. Thus, when conventional diagrams of isotopic ratios cannot distinguish pollution sources, coprostanol may be a useful tool. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:55:12","2018-01-19 23:55:12","","663-668","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; Pollution; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; nitrate; Agriculture; nitrogen; Nitrates; Fertilizers; Animalia; Isotopes; stable isotope; groundwater pollution; Japan; pollutant source; source identification; Source identification; Stable isotopes; Nitrogen fertilizers; carbon; Chemical fertilizers; Contaminant sources; Coprostanol; Fecal contamination; fertilizer; Intestinal bacteria; Kyushu; Nagasaki [Kyushu]; Nagasaki [Nagasaki (PRF)]; Nitrate pollution; sterol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, nutrients can progressively accumulate in reservoirs, resulting in the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and water quality. Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a large multipurpose reservoir, located on the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), that serves as a major source of freshwater in Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the past several years, changes in land use (e.g. expansion of urban areas and industrial developments) in the reservoir's catchment have heightened concerns about future water quality in the catchment and in the reservoir. Intensification of agricultural activities has led to an increase in augmented the application of manure and fertilizer for crops and pasture. Although previous research has attempted to quantify nutrient retention in LD, there is a knowledge gap related to the identification of major nutrient sources and quantification of nutrient export from the catchment at different spatial scales. Using the SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed (SPARROW) model, this gap has been addressed by assessing water quality regionally, and identifying spatial patterns of factors and processes that affect water quality in the LD catchment. Model results indicate that LD retains about 70% of the inflowing total nitrogen (TN) and 90% of the inflowing total phosphorus (TP) loads, of which fertilizer and manure applied to agricultural fields contribute the greatest proportion. The SPARROW model will be useful as a tool to guide the optimal implementation of nutrient management plans to reduce nutrient inputs to LD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:55:26","2018-01-19 23:55:26","","166-185","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Water quality; catchment; reservoir; regression analysis; water quality; hydrological modeling; Land use; Water pollution; water resource; Agriculture; watershed; Aquatic ecosystems; assessment method; Canada; Catchments; Flow of water; human activity; fertilizer application; Fertilizers; land use change; Reservoirs (water); Nutrients; inflow; Eutrophication; prairie; Saskatchewan; River catchment; Multipurpose reservoirs; nutrient enrichment; SPARROW; Agricultural activities; agricultural intensification; Manures; source identification; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nutrient loading; Industrial development; manure; Nutrient management plans; Saskatchewan River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New wavelet methods identified 2- and 4-year periodicities from the streamflow time series. A composite analysis of meteorological data revealed that the anomalously high daily streamflow events coincided with Rossby waves emanating from the tropical Pacific and an eastern mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) dipole pattern in which negative MSLP anomalies were situated over the southeast US and positive MSLP anomalies were situated over the northwestern North Atlantic Ocean. Based on this pattern, a new Eastern North American (ENA) index was constructed that could explain more daily streamflow variance than existing climate indices. A wavelet coherence analysis identified ENA index relationships with streamflow and salinity at periods of 2–4 years, suggesting that the ENA index may offer predictability beyond the weather forecasting timescale. The ENA index was also found to be phase-locked to the Gulf Stream index at a period of 74 months. Because the MSLP dipole pattern is linked to the upstream Rossby wave train, salinity variability at that timescale may have resulted from MSLP dipole-related changes in precipitation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:55:35","2018-01-19 23:55:35","","65-79","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Climate change; North Atlantic Ocean; Teleconnections; United States; atmospheric circulation; streamflow; teleconnection; wavelet analysis; Climate; time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Meteorology; weather forecasting; Sea level; Hydrology; Stream flow; Estuaries; estuarine environment; Wavelet analysis; Streamflow variability; Atlantic Ocean (North); atmosphere-ocean coupling; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Gulf Stream; Large-scale circulation patterns; Mean sea level pressures; Mechanical waves; Mid-Atlantic Ridge; Ocean currents; Rossby wave; Salinity variability; sea surface salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology was applied to the Riaño dam (northern Spain) by analyzing the effects of incoming floods with return periods ranging from one to 10,000 years. We studied four scenarios with different gate failure rates and compared the results assuming initial reservoir level equal to the maximum level allowed in the reservoir under normal operation conditions with those considering variable initial reservoir levels. The ratio of the return periods associated to different reference levels reached in the reservoir considering variable over constant initial level ranged from 2.0 to 4.1. The ratio of the return periods obtained assuming gate failure and no failure for the same reference reservoir level ranged up to 93, 160 and 240 depending on the gate failure rate assigned. The ratio of the return periods associated to different maximum spillway discharges considering variable over constant initial reservoir level ranged from 2.5 to 6.1. However, the ratio of the return periods obtained assuming gate failure and no failure for the same discharge ranged from 0.7 to 1.1, showing no influence of gate failure. For the study case, our analysis highlighted the importance of considering the fluctuation of the initial reservoir levels and different gate failure scenarios, emphasizing that the return periods of maximum levels reached in the reservoir and maximum outflows are the variables that best represent dam and downstream hydrological safety. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:55:46","2018-01-19 23:55:46","","669-684","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dams; discharge; hydrology; reservoir; Spain; probability; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Floods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Hydrology; stochasticity; flood; Reservoirs (water); reliability analysis; return period; safety; dam; Safety engineering; Failure analysis; Dam safety; spillway; Spillways; Failure scenarios; Initial reservoir level; Maximum levels; Normal operations; Reference levels; Stochastic approach; Stochastic methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, an application of the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) network for hydrological data clustering is presented. The GNG is an incremental and unsupervised neural network, which is able to adapt its structure during the training procedure without using a prior knowledge of the size and shape of the network. In the GNG algorithm, the Minimum Description Length (MDL) measure as the cluster validity index is utilized for determining the optimal number of clusters (sub-regions). The capability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by regionalizing drought severities for 40 synoptic weather stations in Iran. To fulfill this aim, first a clustering method is applied to form the sub-regions and then a heterogeneity measure is used to test the degree of heterogeneity of the delineated sub-regions. According to the MDL measure and considering two different indices namely CS and Davies–Bouldin (DB) in the GNG network, the entire study area is subdivided in two sub-regions located in the eastern and western sides of Iran. In order to evaluate the performance of the GNG algorithm, a number of other commonly used clustering methods, like K-means, fuzzy C-means, self-organizing map and Ward method are utilized in this study. The results of the heterogeneity measure based on the L-moments approach reveal that only the GNG algorithm successfully yields homogeneous sub-regions in comparison to the other methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:56:15","2018-01-19 23:56:15","","92-102","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; Regional frequency analysis; algorithm; artificial neural network; cluster analysis; drought; statistical analysis; heterogeneity; frequency analysis; Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Self organizing maps; natural gas; weather station; Clustering methods; Fuzzy clustering; Growing neural gas; L-moments; Minimum description length","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study used a small urban headwater stream in a seasonally dry environment to address two research questions: (1) What concentration (C)-discharge (Q) patterns exist in small urban headwater streams?; and (2) Do the C-Q patterns persist across C-Q metrics and temporal scales? Four C-Q metrics were tested: concentration-discharge (C-Q), concentration-cumulative discharge (C-ΣQ), load (L)-discharge (L-Q) and normalized concentration-normalized discharge (NC-NQ). C-Q and NC-NQ revealed discharge-invariant behaviour for Ca, two linear relationships with threshold-like transitions from negative to positive slopes for Mg, K and Na, and positive linear relationships for Fe, Pb and PO4 3−. The threshold-like transitions with distinct breakpoints were more apparent in C-ΣQ patterns for all solutes. These patterns are consistent with three hypotheses: (1) negative linear to zero slope relationships indicate dilution followed by discharge-invariant behaviour (Ca); (2) negative to positive linear relationships (Mg, K and Na) point to dilution followed by solute enrichment or flushing; and (3) positive to negative linear relationships (Pb, Fe and PO4 3−) suggest initial solute mobilization followed by dilution. The three dominant behaviours were robust across weekly, fortnightly and monthly timescales. Significant linear L-Q relationships were observed for all solutes, suggesting that loads can be predicted from discharge. Our findings suggest that C-Q relationships are highly dynamic, and multiple processes control streamflow hydrochemistry at different times depending on antecedent discharge. The application of multiple C-Q metrics provided additional insights not apparent by using a single metric. The insights are critical to understanding of catchment hydrology and conceptual representation of hydrochemical processes in models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:56:26","2018-01-19 23:56:26","","12-25","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","discharge; streamflow; regression analysis; hydrochemistry; concentration (composition); Catchments; urban area; water stress; Calcium; Hydrochemistry; Lead; threshold; headwater; solute transport; tropical region; partitioning; Tropical environments; dilution; Catchment hydrology; Linear relationships; Sodium; Anthropogenic sources; Break-points; Hydrochemical process; Outsourcing; Piecewise linear; Threshold-like transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantification of recharge to karst springs in these complex geological environments is important both for hydrologic understanding and for effective water resource management. We used spring hydrographs and environmental tracers (isotopes and solutes) to distinguish and estimate the sources of spring water and to identify the flow paths of the recharging waters in three mountainous basins of the western Himalaya. The karst springs are perennial with high discharge amplitudes. The results indicate that ambient temperature has a strong influence on the hydrological behavior of the springs. Although the spring flow is dominantly controlled by the melting of snow and/or glaciers, rain events produce sharp spikes in spring hydrographs. The facies patterns in springs within the Bringi basin (Ca-HCO3) and the Liddar basin (Ca-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-HCO3) suggest flow dominantly through limestone and dolomite. Higher concentrations of SO4 2− and Na+ in warm springs of the Kuthar basin indicate flow through carbonate, silicate and other rocks. The isotopic composition (δ18O, δ2H) of precipitation, snowpacks, glacier melt and karst springs show wide variation both in space and time, and are strongly influenced by the basin relief and meteorology. The tracer-based two- and three-component mixing models suggest that the snowmelt dominantly contributes to the spring flow (55–96%), followed by glacier melt (5–36%) and rain (4–34%). Based on tracer tests with good recovery rates, springs are dominantly recharged through point sources rather than by diffuse infiltration. Changes in the timing, form, and amount of winter precipitation substantially affect the timing and magnitude of spring discharge during the rest of the year. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:56:39","2018-01-19 23:56:39","","239-252","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrographs; Rain; Snow; Water management; Water resources; Groundwater; Precipitation (meteorology); Landforms; Waterresource management; Calcium; Isotopes; Geological environment; Isotopic composition; Himalayas; Silicates; Environmental tracers; Stable isotopes; Centrostegia thurberi; Geothermal springs; Karst springs; Springs (water)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mapping the susceptibility to debris flow is an important aid for risk mitigation. We propose a novel practical approach to derive debris flow inundation maps useful for susceptibility assessment, that is based on the integrated use of DEM-based spatially-distributed hydrological and slope stability models with debris flow propagation models. More specifically, the TRIGRS infiltration and infinite slope stability model and the FLO-2D model for the simulation of the related debris flow propagation and deposition are combined. An empirical instability-to-debris flow triggering threshold calibrated on the basis of observed events, is applied to link the two models and to accomplish the task of determining the amount of unstable mass that develops as a debris flow. Calibration of the proposed methodology is carried out based on real data of the debris flow event occurred on 1 October 2009, in the Peloritani mountains area (Italy). Model performance, assessed by receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) indexes, evidences fairly good reproduction of the observed event. Comparison with the performance of the traditional debris flow modeling procedure, in which sediment and water hydrographs are inputed as lumped at selected points on top of the streams, is also performed, in order to assess quantitatively the limitations of such commonly applied approach. Results show that the proposed method, besides of being more process-consistent than the traditional hydrograph-based approach, can potentially provide a more accurate simulation of debris-flow phenomena, in terms of spatial patterns of erosion and deposition as well on the quantification of mobilized volumes and depths, avoiding overestimation of debris flow triggering volume and, thus, of maximum inundation flow depths. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:56:48","2018-01-19 23:56:48","","130-143","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Italy; Rain; Sicily; rainfall; hydrological modeling; Floods; two-dimensional modeling; risk assessment; vulnerability; infiltration; Deposition; digital elevation model; flow modeling; threshold; trigger mechanism; Debris; debris flow; erosion; deposition; depth; hydrographic survey; slope stability; volume; Slope stability; Debris flows; Facsimile; Giampilieri; Messina [Sicily]; Peloritani Mountains; Propagation modeling; Triggering model; TRIGRS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is not clear how grid–based regionalisation methods perform at continental or global scale, particularly for data–sparse region. This study uses 605 unregulated catchments widely distributed across Australia to evaluate two grid–based regionalisation approaches—gridded spatial proximity (SP_g) and gridded integrated similarity (IS_g) — and their lumped counterparts (SP_l and IS_l). To test robustness of the regionalisation methods, each was tested using two rainfall–runoff models: SIMHYD and Xinanjiang. We found that overall the gridded and lumped regionalisation approaches are marginally different and the two models show consistent regionalisation results. However, the IS_g approach outperforms the others in the dry and sparsely located catchments, and it overcomes the unnatural tessellated effect obtained from the SP_g approach. It is promising to use the IS_g approach for runoff estimates and water accounts in the Australian continent and possibly in other parts of world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:56:59","2018-01-19 23:56:59","","279-293","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Rain; Runoff; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; regionalization; spatial analysis; Forecasting; integrated approach; runoff; Catchments; Runoff modelling; Integrated similarity; Regionalisation; Runoff prediction; Spatial proximity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It consists on the integration of three components: stochastic time series modelling for prediction of inflows and future reservoir storages at the beginning of the irrigation season; statistical regression for the evaluation of water deliveries based on projected inflows and storages; and econometric modelling for economic assessment of the production value of agriculture based on irrigation water deliveries and crop prices. Therefore, the effect of the price volatility can be isolated from the losses due to water scarcity in the assessment of the drought impacts. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to generate probability functions of inflows, which are translated into probabilities of storages, deliveries, and finally, production value of agriculture. The framework also allows the assessment of the value of mitigation measures as reduction of economic losses during droughts. The approach was applied to the Jucar river basin, a complex system affected by multiannual severe droughts, with irrigated agriculture as the main consumptive demand. Probability distributions of deliveries and production value were obtained for each irrigation season. In the majority of the irrigation districts, drought causes a significant economic impact. The increase of crop prices can partially offset the losses from the reduction of production due to water scarcity in some districts.

Utilizing a suite of temporal groundwater sample datasets, in situ monitoring of temperature, pressure, pH and electrical conductivity from multiple field trips to Crystal geyser from 2007 to 2014, periodic trends in groundwater chemistry from the geyser effluent were identified. Based on chemical characteristics, the primary sourcing aquifers are characterized to be both the Entrada and Navajo Sandstones with a minor contribution from Paradox Formation brine. The single eruption cycle at Crystal geyser lasted over four days and was composed of four parts: Minor Eruption (mEP), Major Eruption (MEP), Aftershock Eruption (Ae) and Recharge (R). During the single eruption cycle, dissolved ionic species vary 0–44% even though the degree of changes for individual ions are different. Generally, Na+, K+, Cl− and SO42− regularly decrease at the onset and throughout the MEP. These species then increase in concentration during the mEP. Conversely, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and Sr2+ increase and decrease in concentration during the MEP and mEP, respectively. The geochemical inverse modeling with PHREEQC was conducted to characterize the contribution from three end-members (Entrada Sandstone, Navajo Sandstone and Paradox Formation brine) to the resulting Crystal geyser effluent. Results of the inverse modeling showed that, during the mEP, the Navajo, Entrada and brine supplied 62–65%, 36–33% and 1–2%, respectively. During the MEP, the contribution shifted to 53–56%, 45–42% and 1–2% for the Navajo, Entrada and Paradox Formation brine, respectively.

The 19 lakes were divided into two groups according to EC (threshold value = 800 µS cm−1): fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). The fluorescent characteristics of CDOM in the 19 lakes were investigated using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) and multivariate analysis. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2), and one tyrosine-like component (C4) were identified by PARAFAC. The component C4 was not included in subsequent analyses due to the strong scatter in some colloidal water samples from brackish water lakes. The correlations between Fmax for the three EEM-PARAFAC extracted CDOM components C1–C3, the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) and the water quality parameters (i.e., TN, TP, Chl-a, pH, EC, turbidity (Turb) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) were determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results of RDA analysis showed that spatial variation in land cover, pollution sources, and salinity/EC gradients in water quality affected Fmax for the fluorescent components C1–C3 and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310). Further examination indicated that the CDOM fluorescent components and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) did not significantly differ (t-test, p &gt; 0.05) in fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). There was a difference in the distribution of the average Fmax for the CDOM fluorescent components between C1 to C3 from agricultural sources and urban wastewater sources in hypereutrophic brackish water lakes. The Fmax for humic-like components C1 and C3 spatially varied with land cover among the 19 lakes. Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of Fmax for CDOM fluorescent components and their correlations with water quality can be evaluated by EEM-PARAFAC and multivariate analysis among the 19 lakes across semiarid regions of Northeast China, which has potential implication for lakes with similar genesis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:57:42","2018-01-19 23:57:42","","80-91","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water quality; water quality; parallel computing; Pollution; Water pollution; Water; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; Multivariant analysis; lake water; Lakes; Carbon; Quality control; Organic carbon; semiarid region; River pollution; wastewater; agricultural emission; Water analysis; Biological materials; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic matter; Arid regions; multivariate analysis; brackish water; pollutant source; humic substance; Fluorescence; Amino acids; Songhua Basin; Jilin; organic compound; Lake pollution; Brackish water; Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopies; fluorescence spectroscopy; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fluorescent characteristic; Fluorescent components; Multi variate analysis; Pollution sources; Redundancy analysis (RDA); Songhua Lake","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most commonly used methods and techniques in riverbank filtration studies are: Geographical Information System (GIS) (site suitability/surface characterization), Geophysical, Pumping Test and borehole logging (sub-surface), Hydrochemical, Geochemical, and Statistical techniques (hydrochemistry of water), Numerical modelling, Tracer techniques and Stable Isotope Approaches (degradation and contaminants attenuation processes). From the summary in Table 1, hydrochemical, numerical modelling and pumping test are the frequently used and popular methods, while geophysical, GIS and statistical techniques are the less attractive. However, many researchers prefer integrated approach especially that riverbank filtration studies involve diverse and interrelated components. In term of spatial popularity and successful implementation of riverbank filtration, it is explicitly clear that the popularity and success of the technology is more pronounced in developed countries like U.S. and most European countries. However, it is gradually gaining ground in Asia and Africa, although it is not far from its infancy state in Africa, where the technology could be more important considering the economic status of the region and its peculiarity when it comes to water resources predicaments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:57:55","2018-01-19 23:57:55","","497-515","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Europe; GIS; United States; Water resources; Asia; Africa; water quality; integrated approach; numerical model; Geophysics; assessment method; Numerical methods; Geographic information systems; Surface waters; river bank; Water filtration; Hydrochemistry; Numerical models; Statistical techniques; geophysical method; pumping; Integrated approach; borehole logging; filtration; Geophysical methods; Interrelated components; Quality improvement; River bank filtrations; Riverbank filtration; Spatial applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way to help with resilience to future droughts is to understand the characteristics of historic droughts and how these have changed over the recent past. Although, on average, Great Britain experiences a relatively wet climate it is also prone to periods of low rainfall which can lead to droughts. Until recently research into droughts of Great Britain has been neglected compared to other natural hazards such as storms and floods. This study is the first to use a national-scale gridded hydrological model to characterise droughts across Great Britain over the last century. Firstly, the model performance at low flows is assessed and it is found that the model can simulate low flows well in many catchments across Great Britain. Next, the threshold level method is applied to time series of monthly mean river flow and soil moisture to identify historic droughts (1891–2015). It is shown that the national-scale gridded output can be used to identify historic drought periods. A quantitative assessment of drought characteristics shows that groundwater-dependent areas typically experience more severe droughts, which have longer durations rather than higher intensities. There is substantial spatial and temporal variability in the drought characteristics, but there are no consistent changes through time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:58:07","2018-01-19 23:58:07","","368-385","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Drought severity; United Kingdom; catchment; drought; groundwater; low flow; rainfall; river flow; simulation; soil moisture; Drought characteristics; Drought; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; spatiotemporal analysis; natural hazard; Catchments; Flow of water; Soil moisture; flood; storm; Stream flow; Moisture; groundwater-surface water interaction; Low flow; River flow; Great Britain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, runoff processes are probably not stationary in the case of a probable maximum flood (PMF) where discharge greatly exceeds observed flood peaks. Developing hydrodynamic models and using them to build coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic models can potentially improve the plausibility of PMF estimations. This study aims to assess the potential benefits and constraints of coupled modelling compared to standard deterministic hydrologic modelling when it comes to PMF estimation. The two modelling approaches are applied using a set of 100 spatio-temporal probable maximum precipitation (PMP) distribution scenarios. The resulting hydrographs, the resulting peak discharges as well as the reliability and the plausibility of the estimates are evaluated. The discussion of the results shows that coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models substantially improves the physical plausibility of PMF modelling, although both modelling approaches lead to PMF estimations for the catchment outlet that fall within a similar range. Using a coupled model is particularly suggested in cases where considerable flood-prone areas are situated within a catchment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:58:20","2018-01-19 23:58:20","","157-165","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; discharge; rainfall-runoff modeling; probability; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; runoff; Model coupling; calibration; hydrodynamics; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrodynamics; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); Rainfall - Runoff modelling; hydrograph; coupling; estimation method; precipitation (climatology); flood; reliability analysis; Hydrological system; Potential benefits; Probable maximum precipitation; Probable maximum floods; Hydrologic modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model combines a planning workflow to define suitability of catchments based on physical, socio-economic and ecologic variables, with an allocation workflow to constrain suitable RWH sites as function of project specific features (e.g., distance from rainfall collection to application area). The planning workflow comprises a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) implemented on a Geographic Information System (GIS), whereas the allocation workflow is based on a multiple-parameter ranking analysis. When compared to other similar models, improvement comes with the flexible weights of MCA and the entire allocation workflow. The method is tested in a contaminated watershed (the Ave River basin) located in Portugal. The pilot project encompasses the irrigation of a 400 ha crop land that consumes 2.69 Mm3 of water per year. The application of harvested water in the irrigation replaces the use of stream water with excessive anthropogenic nutrients that may raise nitrosamines in the food and accumulation in the food chain, with severe consequences to human health (cancer). The selected rainfall collection catchment is capable to harvest 12 Mm3·yr−1 (≈ 4.5 × the requirement) and is roughly 3 km far from the application area assuring crop irrigation by gravity flow with modest transport costs.

However, it is difficult to assimilate two different types of observations into a rainfall–runoff model simultaneously because there is a time lag between soil moisture and streamflow owing to the runoff routing process. In this study, we developed an effective data assimilation scheme based on the ensemble Kalman filter and smoother (named as EnKF-S) to exploit the benefits of the two observation types while accounting for the runoff routing lag. To prove the importance of accounting for the time lag, a scheme named Dual-EnKF was used to compare. To demonstrate the schemes, we designed synthetic cases regarding two typical flood patterns, i.e., flash flood and gradual flood. The results show that EnKF-S can effectively improve flood forecasting compared with Dual-EnKF, particularly when the runoff routing has distinct time lags. For the synthetic cases, EnKF-S reduced root–mean–square error (RMSE) by more than 70% relative to the data assimilation scheme without considering runoff routing lags. Therefore, this effective data assimilation scheme holds great potential for short-term flood forecasting by merging observations from ground measurement and remote sensing retrievals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:58:57","2018-01-19 23:58:57","","568-579","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; rainfall-runoff modeling; soil moisture; streamflow; remote sensing; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Floods; Data assimilation; Flood control; Flood forecasting; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; runoff; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soils; flash flood; Kalman filter; flood forecasting; Stream flow; Moisture; ground-based measurement; Ground measurements; Routing lags; Routing process; Runoff model; Square errors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This framework couples the 1D-2D hydrodynamic simulation package MIKE FLOOD with the agent-based urban development model DAnCE4Water and provides the possibility to systematically test various flood risk adaptation measures ranging from large infrastructure changes over decentralised water management to urban planning policies. We have tested the framework in a case study in Melbourne, Australia considering 9 scenarios for urban development and climate and 32 potential combinations of flood adaptation measures. We found that the performance of adaptation measures strongly depended on the considered climate and urban development scenario and the other implementation measures implemented, suggesting that adaptive strategies are preferable over one-off investments. Urban planning policies proved to be an efficient means for the reduction of flood risk, while implementing property buyback and pipe increases in a guideline-oriented manner was too costly. Random variations in location and time point of urban development could have significant impact on flood risk and would in some cases outweigh the benefits of less efficient adaptation strategies.

A comparative analysis of TMPA-3B42V7 with IMD gauge-based gridded dataset was carried out on daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly basis for 16 years (1998–2013). The study revealed that TMPA estimates performed reasonably well with the gauge-based gridded dataset, however, some significant biases were also observed. It has been observed that TMPA overestimates at very light rain, but underestimates at light, moderate, heavy and very heavy rainfall intensities. Further, the TMPA estimates was evaluated for prediction of daily suspended sediment load (SL) employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) with wavelet analysis (WASVM). Initially, 1-day ahead SL prediction was performed using best WASVM model. The results showed that 1-day predictions were very precise and shows a better agreement with the observed SL data. Later, the developed WASVM model was used for the prediction of SL for the higher leads period. The statistical analysis shows that the developed WASVM model could predict the target value successfully up to 6-days lead and found to be not suitable for higher lead specifically in the selected watersheds with similar hydro-climatic conditions like the ones selected in this study. Predictions results of WASVM model is superior to conventional SVM model and could be used as an effective forecasting tool for hydrological applications. The study suggest that the use of TMPA precipitation estimates can be a compensating approach after suitable bias correction and have potential for SL prediction in data-sparse regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:59:27","2018-01-19 23:59:27","","103-117","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climatic conditions; Rain; prediction; rainfall; wavelet analysis; data set; hydrological modeling; Sediments; Forecasting; Support vector machines; Watersheds; suspended load; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); Gages; raingauge; India; support vector machine; precipitation intensity; Rain gages; satellite imagery; TRMM; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; Wavelet analysis; Suspended sediment loads; Satellite precipitation; Comparative analysis; WASVM; Wavelet support vector machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study quantifies statistically the temporal variability in precipitation and streamflow at a regional scale in the semi-arid area of South Texas associated with three climate indices: El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Results show that ENSO and PDO strongly modulate rainfall during the cold season and, to various extents, streamflow during the cold and warm seasons. In addition, this study shows that in South Texas streamflow is consistently below normal (i.e. means) while precipitation slightly increases during AMO-warm. To different extents, the Pacific and Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies show stronger influences on the climate of South Texas when coupled. Droughts are more correlated with La Niña events but these events play a secondary role during PDO-cold. Although the PDO-cold phase is the dominant driver of droughts in this area, our analyses also show that the coupled effect of the PDO-cold/AMO-warm phases significantly increases the intensity of drought conditions to a degree similar to the PDO-cold/La Niña coupled effect.

We developed a new approach based on the analysis of a dense network of water-table data. It is based on the concept that large-scale variations in hydraulic head may give information on large-scale aquifer parameters. The method assumes that flux into the aquifer is mainly sub-horizontal and that the water table is mostly controlled by topography, rather than recharge. It is based on an empirical statistical relationship between field data on transmissivity and the inverse slope values of a topography-reduced water-table map. This relationship is used to compute a transmissivity map that must be validated with field measurements. The proposed approach can provide a general pattern of transmissivity, or hydraulic conductivity, but cannot correctly reproduce strong variations at very local scale (less than10 m), and will face of some uncertainties where vertical flows cannot be neglected. The method was tested on a peridotite (ultramafic rock) aquifer of 3.5 km2 in area located in New Caledonia. The resulting map shows transmissivity variations over about 5 orders of magnitude (average LogT: −5.2 ± 0.7). Comparison with a map based on measured water-level data (n = 475) shows that the comparison between LogT-computed values and LogT data deduced from 28 hydraulic tests is estimated with an error less than 20% in 71% of cases (LogT ± 0.4), and with an error less than 10% (LogT ± 0.2 on average) in 39% of cases. From this map a hydraulic-conductivity map has been computed showing values ranging over 8 orders of magnitude. The repeatability of the approach was tested on a second data set of hydraulic-head measurements (n = 543); the mean deviation between both LogT maps is about 11%. These encouraging results show that the method can give valuable parameter estimates, and can characterize aquifer heterogeneity. The computed LogT and LogK maps highlight the spatial distribution of parameters that show a pattern clearly controlled by the fault network of this ultramafic massif. However, the faults are mainly characterized by low-permeability zones; this differs from results on other crystalline aquifers and may be due to the fact that weathering products of peridotite are clay-like materials. The resulting transmissivity map can be used as a starting point for modelling or to direct additional fieldwork. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-19 23:59:51","2018-01-19 23:59:51","","118-129","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","regionalization; topography; Hydrogeology; parameterization; heterogeneity; Parameter estimation; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; numerical method; spatial distribution; Water levels; groundwater flow; water level; hydraulic conductivity; weathering; water table; map; Inverse problems; Crystalline rocks; Orders of magnitude; Hydraulic conductivity; hydraulic head; Weathering; Statistical relationship; Transmissivity; fractured medium; crystalline rock; Aquifer heterogeneity; Crystalline materials; transmissivity; hard rock; Hard-rock aquifers; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; Aquifer parameters; Clay products; Fractured aquifer; Low permeability zone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a methodology to help in the identification of both end-members and such reactions, so as to improve mixing ratio calculations. The proposed approach consists of: (1) identifying the potential chemical reactions with the help of EMMA; (2) defining decoupled conservative chemical components consistent with those reactions; (3) repeat EMMA with the decoupled (i.e., conservative) components, so as to identify end-members waters; and (4) computing mixing ratios using the new set of components and end-members.

The cycle presents significant spatial variability, which is strongly affected by natural climate and anthropogenic influences. As one of the major anthropogenic influences, vegetation change unavoidably alters surface property and subsequent the terrestrial water cycle, while its contribution is yet difficult to isolate from the mixed influences. Here, we use satellite and in-situ datasets to identify the terrestrial water cycle dynamics in spatial detail and to evaluate the impact of vegetation change. Methodologically, the water cycle is identified by the indicator of difference between evapotranspiration and precipitation (E-P). Then the scalar form of the indicator's trend (ΔE+ΔP) is used for evaluating the dynamics of water cycle, with the positive value means acceleration and negative means deceleration. Then, the contributions of climate and vegetation change are isolated by the trajectory-based method. Our results indicate that 4 accelerating and 4 decelerating water cycles can be identified, affecting 42.11% of global land. The major water cycle type is characterized by non-changing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration (PNO-EIN), which covers 20.88% of globally land. Vegetation change amplifies both accelerating and decelerating water cycles. It tends to intensify the trend of the decelerating water cycles, while climate change weakens the trend. In the accelerating water cycles, both vegetation and climate change present positive effect to intensify the trend. The effect of plant cover change varies with the coverage. In particular, vegetation change intensifies the water cycle in moderately vegetated regions (0.1 < NDVI < 0.6), but weakens the cycle in sparsely or highly vegetated regions (NDVI < 0.1 or 0.6 < NDVI < 0.8). In extremely vegetated regions (NDVI > 0.85), the water cycle is accelerated because of the significant increase of precipitation. We conclude that vegetation change acts as an amplifier for both accelerating and decelerating terrestrial water cycles, depending on the degree of vegetation coverage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:00:26","2018-01-20 00:00:26","","220-229","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Vegetation; Dynamics; Spatial variability; Anthropogenic influence; Vegetation coverage; Global water cycle; Vegetation change; Water cycle; Contribution; Trajectory-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Flood-forecasting models are thus required to provide simulations at high temporal resolutions (1 h–6 h), although time-series of input and runoff data with sufficient lengths are often only available at the daily temporal resolution, especially in developing countries. This has led to study the relationships of estimated parameter values at the temporal resolutions where they are needed from the temporal resolutions where they are available. This study presents a methodology to treat empirically model-parameter dependencies on the temporal resolution of data in two small basins using a bucket-type hydrological model, HBV-light, and the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation approach for selecting its parameters. To avoid artefacts due to the numerical resolution or numerical method of the differential equations within the model, the model was consistently run using modelling time-steps of one-hour regardless of the temporal resolution of the rainfall-runoff data. The distribution of the parameters calibrated at several temporal resolutions in the two basins did not show model-parameter dependencies on the temporal resolution of data and the direct transferability of calibrated parameter sets (e.g., daily) for runoff simulations at other temporal resolutions for which they were not calibrated (e.g., 3 h or 6 h) resulted in a moderate (if any) decrease in model performance, in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe and volume-error efficiencies. The results of this study indicate that if sub-daily forcing data can be secured, flood forecasting in basins with sub-daily concentration times may be possible with model-parameter values calibrated from long time series of daily data. Further studies using more models and basins are required to test the generality of these results. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-20 00:00:39","2018-01-20 00:00:39","","399-411","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Rain; Runoff; Time series; prediction; rainfall-runoff modeling; parameter estimation; Developing countries; hydrological modeling; Floods; Parameter estimation; Flood control; Flood forecasting; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; concentration (composition); runoff; Differential equations; numerical method; calibration; Numerical methods; Rainfall - Runoff modelling; flood forecasting; diurnal variation; developing world; spatial resolution; Temporal resolution; basin analysis; Hepatitis B virus; Modelling time; Parameter transferability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is often difficult to implement FFA in ungauged or poorly gauged basins because of the lack of consistent and long-term records of streamflow observations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of satellite-based precipitation estimates for performing FFA in two presumably ungauged tributaries, the Jialing and Tuojiang Rivers, of the upper Yangtze River. Annual peak flow series were simulated using the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) hydrologic model. Flood frequency was estimated by fitting the Pearson type III distribution of both observed and modeled streamflow with historic floods. Comparison of satellite-based precipitation products with a ground-based daily precipitation dataset for the period 2002–2014 reveals that 3B42V7 outperformed 3B42RT. The 3B42V7 product also shows consistent reliability in streamflow simulation and FFA (e.g., relative errors −20%−5% in the Jialing River). The results also indicate that complex terrain, drainage area, and reservoir construction are important factors that impact hydrologic model performance. The larger basin (156,736 km2) is more likely to produce satisfactory results than the small basin (19,613 km2) under similar circumstances (e.g., Jialing/Tuojiang calibrated by 3B42V7 for the calibration period: NSCE = 0.71/0.56). Using the same calibrated parameter sets from the entire Jialing River basin, the 3B42V7/3B42RT-driven hydrologic model performs better for two tributaries of the Jialing River (e.g., for the calibration period, NSCE = 0.71/0.60 in the Qujiang River basin and 0.54/0.38 in the Fujiang River basin) than for the upper mainstem of the Jialing River (NSCE = 0.34/0.32), which has more cascaded reservoirs with all these tributaries treated as ungauged basins for model validation. Overall, this study underscores that the simulated flood quantiles from satellite precipitation-driven streamflow are generally consistent with observations, demonstrating the potential hydrologic utility of satellite precipitation data for FFA in the Jialing River basin and possibly other poorly gauged basins. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:00:50","2018-01-20 00:00:50","","478-496","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; China; Water resources; performance assessment; streamflow; Flood frequency analysis; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; Flood control; Satellites; Watersheds; model validation; Precipitation (meteorology); Digital storage; precipitation assessment; Daily precipitations; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Precipitation products; Yangtze River; peak flow; flood frequency; tributary; Streamflow simulations; ground-based measurement; Yangtze Basin; hydraulic structure; Guangdong; Satellite precipitation; Fujiang River; Jialing River; Qujiang; Reservoir constructions; TMPA; Upper Yangtze River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analyzed seven years of high frequency monitoring of in-stream electrical conductivity (EC), hydro-climatic conditions, and vegetation dynamics in four experimental catchments located in headwaters of the Sumava Mountains, Central Europe. The aim was to determine the effects of insect-induced forest disturbance on in-stream EC at multiple timescales, including annual and seasonal average conditions, daily variability, and responses to individual rainfall events. Results showed increased annual average in-stream EC values in the bark beetle-infected catchments, with particularly elevated EC values during baseflow conditions. This is likely caused by the cumulative loading of soil water and groundwater that discharge excess amounts of substances such as nitrogen and carbon, which are released via the decomposition of the needles, branches, and trunks of dead trees, into streams. Furthermore, we concluded that infestation-induced changes in event-scale dynamics may be largely responsible for the observed shifts in annual average conditions. For example, systematic EC differences between baseflow conditions and event flow conditions in relatively undisturbed catchments were essentially eliminated in catchments that were highly disturbed by bark beetles. These changes developed relatively rapidly after infestation and have long-lasting (decadal-scale) effects, implying that cumulative impacts of increasingly frequent bark beetle outbreaks may contribute to alterations of the hydrogeochemical conditions in more vulnerable mountain regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:01:04","2018-01-20 00:01:04","","635-649","","","550","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climatic conditions; Runoff; discharge; groundwater; streamflow; Asia; North America; Groundwater; vulnerability; Catchments; Forestry; Soil moisture; soil water; Carbon; disturbance; timescale; Stream flow; vegetation dynamics; baseflow; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; mountain region; Experimental catchments; Electric conductivity; Vegetation dynamics; High-frequency monitoring; Bark beetle; beetle; mortality; Scolytinae; Forest disturbances; geochemical method; Bohemian Forest; Bohemian Massif; forested catchment; Hexapoda; Multiple timescales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sediment carbon processes simulated in the new numerical model include in-conduit erosion and deposition, sediment carbon transport, surficial fine grained laminae evolution, carbon pool mixing, microbial oxidation, and the understudied process of sediment carbon exchange during equilibrium transport. The authors perform a model evaluation procedure that includes generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation to quantify uncertainty of the model results. Modeling results suggest that phreatic karst conduits sustain sediment transport activity long after surface storm events cease. The sustained sediment transport has the potential to shift the baseflow sediment yield of the phreatic karst to be on par with stormflow sediment yield. The sustained activity is suggested to promote the exchange of sediment carbon between the water column and subsurface karst deposits during equilibrium sediment transport conditions. In turn, the sediment carbon exchange impacts the mixing of new and old carbon pools and the flux of carbon from phreatic karst. Integrated numerical model results from this study support the concept that phreatic karst act as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that temporarily stores sediment, turns over carbon at higher rates than surface streams, and recharges degraded carbon back to the fluvial system.

Assumptions underlying many chloride-based tracer methods do not hold where processes such as halide-bearing mineral dissolution, fluid mixing, or diffusion modify dissolved Cl− concentrations. Failure to identify, quantify, or correct such processes can introduce significant uncertainty to chloride-based tracer calculations. Mass balance or isotopic techniques offer a means to address this uncertainty, however, concurrent evaporation or transpiration can complicate corrections. In this study Cl/Br ratios are used to derive equations that can be used to correct a solution's total dissolved Cl− and Br− concentration for inputs from mineral dissolution and/or binary mixing. We demonstrate the equations’ applicability to waters modified by evapotranspiration. The equations can be used to quickly determine the maximum proportion of dissolved Cl− and Br− from each end-member, providing no halide-bearing minerals have precipitated and the Cl/Br ratio of each end member is known. This allows rapid evaluation of halite dissolution or binary mixing contributions to total dissolved Cl− and Br−. Equation sensitivity to heterogeneity and analytical uncertainty is demonstrated through bench-top experiments simulating halite dissolution and variable degrees of evapotranspiration, as commonly occur in arid environments. The predictions agree with the experimental results to within 6% and typically much less, with the sensitivity of the predicted results varying as a function of end-member compositions and analytical uncertainty. Finally, we present a case-study illustrating how the equations presented here can be used to quantify Cl− and Br− sources and sinks in surface water and groundwater and how the equations can be applied to constrain uncertainty in chloride-based tracer calculations. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:01:42","2018-01-20 00:01:42","","571-580","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; evapotranspiration; groundwater; surface water; Uncertainty; hydrochemistry; heterogeneity; concentration (composition); Groundwater; salinity; uncertainty analysis; Surface waters; Salinity; Bins; Mixing; tracer; Transpiration; dissolution; Dissolution; bromide; Chlorine compounds; Surface water and groundwaters; precipitation (chemistry); Minerals; chloride; Chloride minerals; Quantitative modeling; Mineral dissolution; Analytical uncertainty; Chloride mass balance; Geochemical tracer; halite","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the water status of the uppermost soil layer is highly variable in space and time, adequate sensors are required to enable accurate measurements. Therefore, a sensor setup was tested and evaluated in the laboratory and in the field for such a purpose. The arrangement included Hydra Probe and MPS-2 sensors to measure water content and matric potential, respectively. Performance of the MPS-2 was validated in the laboratory by comparing sensor readings with the water potential of a soil, drained to equilibrium for certain pressure steps inside a pressure plate apparatus. Afterwards, six Hydra Probes and twelve MPS-2 sensors were installed in bare soil at a small field plot of about 9 m2. The measurements represented soil water status to a depth of 6 cm from surface. Core samples were repeatedly excavated around the measurement spots. Their water content was determined and the samples were further utilized to analyze water retention characteristics. The tested setup properly reflected changes of near-surface soil water status due to rainfall and evaporation. However, some shortcomings weakened the potential of the chosen arrangement. Site-specific calibration of the Hydra Probes – implemented by relating sensor readings to the water content values of the core samples – confirmed the applicability of the recommended standard calibration parameters for the respective soil texture. The derived user calibration enabled a measurement accuracy of 0.02 cm3·cm−3. Further improvement was restrained by the spatial variability of soil moisture. In this context, spots that were permanently drier or wetter than the others were discovered by means of a temporal stability approach. Performance of MPS-2 sensors was more critical with respect to the objectives. Sensor-to-sensor variation was small at the applied pressure steps of −20, −50, and −100 kPa, but the respective averaged readings were −18, −37, and −57 kPa. At matric potentials of −200 and −300 kPa, the MPS-2 revealed substantial sensor-to-sensor variation. The large deviation of the sensor readings in the field confirmed that the calibration of the MPS-2 should be improved. However, in spite of this inaccuracy, the wide measuring range of the MPS-2 offers suitability to a wide range of potential applications. As an example, water retention functions were calculated from the in-situ data and compared to retention data from the core samples. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:01:53","2018-01-20 00:01:53","","301-312","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; performance assessment; soil moisture; water content; environmental monitoring; accuracy assessment; sensor; in situ measurement; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; spatial variation; Accuracy; Soil surveys; bare soil; soil surface; Water content; Spatial variability; water retention; Accurate measurement; probe; Probes; Core samples; Hydra; matric potential; Matric potential; MPS-2; Pressure plate apparatus; Site specific calibration; Water retention characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that the distribution of θ was controlled by soil texture, topography, and vegetation. Soil water dried fastest at the beginning after the initial irrigation event and decreased with time and soil depth, which was consistent with classical soil drying theory and experiments. It was also found that the soil dried fastest in the loamy and duplex soils present in the field, which was attributable to deep drainage and preferential flow.

In this study, an effort to explore the relationship between the arid environment and ground water recharge was carried out using multivariate statistical techniques in a sedimentary drainage basin (the Jungar) in northwestern China. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed based on hydrogeochemical data to assess the ground water recharge and its governing factors. Observation of the HCA and PCA analytical results revealed a division of seven clusters (C1 to C7) and three principal components (PC1 to PC3), which explained 59.6%, 16.6% and 10.9% of the variance, respectively, and thus, accounted for the majority of the total variance in the original dataset. Based on these Q-mode HCA clusters and R-mode PAC scores, dominant environmental processes influencing recharge regimes were identified, i.e., geogenic, geomorphoclimatic, and anthropogenic, which separated the recharge regimes into four zones (Zone I to Zone IV). Zones I and II (C4 + C1) were associated to “elevated hydroclimate degree” coupled to “low salinity”. Zone III (C2 + C3) was associated to “moderately elevated salinity” and evidently “elevated contamination” but coupled to “low hydroclimate degree”. Zone IV (C5 + C6 + C7) was associated mainly to “elevated salinity” coupled to “low or inverse hydroclimate degree”. It revealed that the geogenic processes are more significant (60%) than the geomorphoclimatic (17%) and anthropogenic (11%) processes. As a result, the overall recharge process is rather heterogeneous and is strongly environment dominated in the Jungar drainage system. Compared with other watersheds in arid environment, a distinctive feature of the Jungar waters is that they are affected by a combination of natural and non-natural events, rather than following a steady and continuous geological evolution.

At present, the hydrological regime of the Xijiang River has now become complicated, the water shortages and successive droughts pose a threat to regional economic development. However, the complexity of hydroclimatological processes with emphasizes on drought has not been comprehended. In order to effectively predict and develop the adaptation strategies to cope with the water scarcity damage caused by hydrological droughts, it is essential to thoroughly analyze the relationship between hydrological droughts and pre/post-dependent hydroclimatological factors. To accomplish this, the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition method (ESMD) was utilized to reveal the periodic variation in hydrological droughts that is characterized by the Standardized Drought Index (SDI). In addition, the cross-wavelet transform method was applied to investigate the correlation between large-scale climate indices and drought. The results showed that hydrological drought had the most significant response to spring ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation), and the response lags in sub-basins were mostly 8–9 months except that in Yujiang River were mainly 5 or 8 months. Signal reservoir operation in the Yujiang River reduced drought severity by 52–95.8% from January to April over the 2003–2014 time period. Similarly, the cascade reservoir alleviated winter and spring droughts in the Hongshuihe River Basin. However, autumn drought was aggravated with severity increased by 41.9% in September and by 160.9% in October, so that the land surface models without considering human intervention must be used with caution in the hydrological simulation. The response lags of the VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) to hydrological drought were different in the sub-basins. The response lag for the Hongshuihe, Yujiang, and Liujiang River Basins were mostly 0–4 months, 0–1 months, and 2–3 months, respectively, but there was no obvious regular change pattern in the Guijiang River Basin. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:02:48","2018-01-20 00:02:48","","512-524","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Disasters; Vegetation; Water management; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; correlation; drought; reservoir; wavelet analysis; Climatology; climate change; water management; Drought; Rivers; vegetation cover; Economics; Watersheds; disaster management; Disaster prevention; hydrological response; Hydrological simulations; Reservoirs (water); hydrometeorology; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; vegetation dynamics; Jiangxi; climate conditions; hydrological regime; Hydrological droughts; Atmospheric pressure; Regional planning; economic development; Vegetation dynamics; Adaptation strategies; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Liu River; Guangdong; Xi Basin; Cross-wavelet transform; Disaster management; Gui River; Hongshui River; Regional economic development; regional economy; Vegetation condition indices; Xi River; Yujiang; Zhujiang Delta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The coupling non-Darcy flow can be produced and controlled using different combination of curtain and pumping wells in foundation pit dewatering to obtain the maximum drawdown using the minimum pumping rate. The Qianjiang Century City Station foundation pit of Hangzhou subway, China, was selected as background. Field experiments were performed to observe the coupling non-Darcy flow in round gravel.

The effectiveness of GP in hydrological system identification has been recognized in recent studies. However, selecting a parsimonious (accurate and simple) model from such alternatives still remains a question. This paper proposes a Pareto-optimal moving average multigene genetic programming (MA-MGGP) approach to develop a parsimonious model for single-station streamflow prediction. The three main components of the approach that take us from observed data to a validated model are: (1) data pre-processing, (2) system identification and (3) system simplification. The data pre-processing ingredient uses a simple moving average filter to diminish the lagged prediction effect of stand-alone data-driven models. The multigene ingredient of the model tends to identify the underlying nonlinear system with expressions simpler than classical monolithic GP and, eventually simplification component exploits Pareto front plot to select a parsimonious model through an interactive complexity-efficiency trade-off. The approach was tested using the daily streamflow records from a station on Senoz Stream, Turkey. Comparing to the efficiency results of stand-alone GP, MGGP, and conventional multi linear regression prediction models as benchmarks, the proposed Pareto-optimal MA-MGGP model put forward a parsimonious solution, which has a noteworthy importance of being applied in practice. In addition, the approach allows the user to enter human insight into the problem to examine evolved models and pick the best performing programs out for further analysis. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:03:14","2018-01-20 00:03:14","","603-615","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","optimization; prediction; streamflow; regression analysis; Streamflow prediction; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Economic and social effects; Data handling; numerical method; Model structures; Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Multi-gene genetic programming; Pareto principle; Pareto-optimal; Parsimonious modeling; Hydrological modelling; complexity; Turkey; Stream flow; stream; Hydrological system; Moving average filter; Multi-linear regression; Religious buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge of soil erosion processes and magnitudes on these slopes is essential to understanding the coupled water-wind erosion processes and to address the resulting downstream coarse sediment problems in the Yellow River. Simulated rainfall (intensity 90 mm h−1) was performed to explore the effects of sand layer thickness on runoff and soil loss from loess slopes covered with different sand layer thicknesses (0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm). Initial runoff time increased with increasing sand layer thickness, with greater changes occurring for the increases in the thinner (0–5 cm) than for the thicker layers (5–25 cm). Total runoff yield from the sand-covered loess slopes was 18%–55% lower than from the uncovered loess slope and decreased with increasing sand layer thickness. In contrast, total sediment yield was up to 14 times greater from the sand-covered loess slopes than from the uncovered loess slope and rapidly increased with increasing sand layer thickness. During the rainstorm, runoff and soil loss rates exhibited unimodal distributions, and they were related by a positive linear function, both before and after the maximum soil loss rate, that had a high determination coefficient (R2 &gt; 0.8, p &lt; 0.05) on loess slopes with sand layer thicknesses greater than 5 cm. The maximum runoff and soil loss rates tended to occur simultaneously and increased abruptly with increasing sand layer thickness. During the rainstorms, some runoff rates on the loess slopes with thicker sand layers were higher than the rainfall intensity due to rainwater combining with water emerging from the saturated sand, which could never occur on the uncovered loess slope. The critical sand layer thickness, which produced a qualitative change in runoff and sediment production modes, appeared to be in the range of 5–10 cm. These results indicated that the thickness of the sand layer on the loess slope significantly influenced runoff and sediment production processes and mechanisms. These effects should be considered when assessing and predicting soil losses in this region and from similar slopes elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:03:27","2018-01-20 00:03:27","","244-251","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Rain; Runoff; Sediments; runoff; Erosion; Storms; Soils; Landforms; soil erosion; rainwater; precipitation intensity; Loess Plateau; rainstorm; Sand; sediment yield; Sediment yields; sand; Runoff coefficients; Yellow River; loess; water erosion; Water erosion; Runoff production","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analysis is based on breakthrough curves (BTCs) from column experiments, which simulated rainfall infiltration and source term release scenario, rather than applying constant tracer solution at the inlet as commonly used. BTCs are re-evaluated and transport parameters are estimated by inverse modelling using two approaches: (1) equilibrium advection-dispersion equation (ADE); and (2) continuous time random walk (CTRW). Firstly, based on a method for calculating leach concentration, the inlet condition with an exponential decay input is identified. Secondly, the results show that approximately 39%–58% of Br− and 16%–49% of Sr2+ are eluted from the columns at the end of the breakthrough experiments. This suggests that trapping mechanisms, including diffusion into immobile zones and attachment of tracer on mineral surfaces, are more pronounced for Sr2+ than for Br−. Thirdly, we demonstrate robustness of CTRW-based truncated power-law (TPL) model in capturing non-Fickian reactive transport with 0 &lt; β &lt; 2, and Fickian transport with β &gt; 2. The non-Fickian dispersion observed experimentally is explained by variations of local flow field from preferential flow paths due to physical heterogeneities. Particularly, the additional sorption process of strontium on clay minerals contributes to the delay of the peak concentration and the tailing features, which leads to an enhanced non-Fickian transport for strontium. Finally, the ADE and CTRW approaches to environmental modelling are evaluated. It is shown that CTRW with a sorption term can describe non-Fickian dispersive transport of strontium at laboratory scale by identifying appropriate parameters, while the traditional ADE with a retardation factor fails to reproduce the complex non-Fickian transport of strontium with strong sorption on clay surface. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:03:39","2018-01-20 00:03:39","","1-11","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; environmental modeling; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; preferential flow; Preferential flows; Environmental modelling; infiltration; dispersion; reactive transport; Leaching; laboratory method; Dispersions; Continuous time systems; Flow fields; Inverse problems; Advection; breakthrough curve; Sorption; flow field; Advection-dispersion equation; Dispersion (waves); remediation; radioactive waste; Radioactive waste disposal; Radioactive wastes; waste disposal; Waste disposal; sorption; Non-fickian transports; Strontium; Breakthrough experiment; clay mineral; contaminated land; Continuous-time random walk; CTRW; Environmental remediation; sandy clay; strontium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following the historical inundation by paleo-seawater during coastal progradation, the aquifer has been undergone progressive freshening and land reclamation to enable settlements and farming. The hydrochemical data of water samples showed a broad hydrochemical change, from Na-Cl through Na-HCO3 to Ca-HCO3 types, suggesting that groundwater was overall evolved through the freshening process accompanying cation exchange. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the hydrochemical data indicates the occurrence of three major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in an aquifer, namely: 1) progressive freshening of remaining paleo-seawater, 2) water-rock interaction (i.e., dissolution of silicates), and 3) redox process including sulfate reduction, as indicated by heavy sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate. To quantitatively assess the hydrogeochemical processes, the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and the forward mixing modeling using PHREEQC code were conducted. The EMMA results show that the hydrochemical model with the two-dimensional mixing space composed of PC 1 and PC 2 best explains the mixing in the study area; therefore, we consider that the groundwater chemistry mainly evolved by mixing among three end-members (i.e., paleo-seawater, infiltrating rain, and the K-rich groundwater). The distinct depletion of sulfate in groundwater, likely due to bacterial sulfate reduction, can also be explained by EMMA. The evaluation of mass balances using geochemical modeling supports the explanation that the freshening process accompanying direct cation exchange occurs through mixing among three end-members involving the K-rich groundwater. This study shows that the multiple end-members mixing model is useful to more successfully assess complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in a salinized aquifer under freshening, as compared to the conventional interpretation using the theoretical mixing line based on only two end-members (i.e., seawater and rainwater). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:03:51","2018-01-20 00:03:51","","703-714","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Principal component analysis; Water quality; groundwater; water quality; hydrological modeling; Floods; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Seawater; salinity; Quality control; Bacteria (microorganisms); bacterium; microbial activity; Mixing; Isotopes; principal component analysis; mixing; chemical analysis; Hydrochemistry; Water rock interactions; isotopic composition; water-rock interaction; reduction; Viet Nam; sulfate; Sulfur compounds; End-member mixing analysis; Hydrogeochemical process; hydrogeochemistry; ion exchange; Ion exchange; Silicates; Positive ions; seawater; Bacterial sulfate reduction; Cation exchanges; Hydro geochemistries; Land reclamation; Mixing models; Oxygen isotope composition; Red River Delta; Thai Binh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To objectively estimate groundwater recharge zones, many field surveys are required that are costly in both time and money. To facilitate the assessment of recharge zones with high efficiency and low expense, this study proposes a ‘fast-filter’ approach based on empirical orthogonal function analysis and applies it in a synthetic case study and to Taiwan's Yilan Plain. In the synthetic case study, we demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively identify the recharge area by considering the head variations driven by rainfall recharge. For the case of Yilan Plain application, the field investigations (i.e., collected wellbore logs and electrical resistivity tomography [ERT] surveys) and a groundwater simulation model support the recharge zones estimated by the proposed method. The study results show that within the estimated recharge zone, all of the collected wellbore logs consist of coarse grains, and thick and continuous high resistivity zones were shown in the ERT profile images. Moreover, the groundwater model indicates that the recharge within the estimated recharge zone is 57.6% of the total recharge despite that the area of the estimated zone is only 26.8% of the study area.

Vulnerability mapping has been used for many years as an effective tool for assessing the potential for aquifer pollution and the most common method of intrinsic vulnerability assessment is DRASTIC (Depth to water table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity). An underlying problem with the DRASTIC approach relates to the subjectivity involved in selecting relative weightings for each of the DRASTIC factors and assigning rating values to ranges or media types within each factor. In this study, a clustering technique is introduced that removes some of the subjectivity associated with the indexing method. It creates a vulnerability map that does not rely on fixed weights and ratings and, thereby provides a more objective representation of the system's physical characteristics. This methodology was applied to an aquifer in Iran and compared with the standard DRASTIC approach using the water quality parameters nitrate, chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) as surrogate indicators of aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method required only four of DRASTIC's seven factors – depth to groundwater, hydraulic conductivity, recharge value and the nature of the vadose zone, to produce a superior result. For nitrate, chloride, and TDS, respectively, the clustering approach delivered Pearson correlation coefficients that were 15, 22 and 5 percentage points higher than those obtained for the DRASTIC method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:04:41","2018-01-20 00:04:41","","27-37","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Iran; Water quality; cluster analysis; groundwater; water quality; aquifer; aquifer pollution; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; vulnerability; Water pollution; drinking water; Potable water; assessment method; data mining; vadose zone; Nitrates; hydraulic conductivity; recharge; semiarid region; Cluster analysis; Water quality parameters; Data mining; Recharging (underground waters); Correlation methods; Pearson correlation coefficients; Arid and semi-arid regions; Hydraulic conductivity; Chlorine compounds; Clustering; Physical characteristics; Vulnerability assessments; DRASTIC; K-means cluster analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For concentration distribution of scalar dispersion, the preliminary estimate of vertical distribution (Wu et al., 2015) on small time scale is rigorously extended to account for high order effects as skewness and kurtosis. Based on a combination of Aris’ method of concentration moments and Gill's generalized dispersion model, up to fourth order terms of vertical distribution functions and full-time two-dimensional concentration distribution are derived. The increments of damping factor, mainly representing the density of vegetation in wetlands, is shown to strengthen the mean distribution asymmetry and reduce the longitudinal dispersivity (with respect to skewness and kurtosis), and to increase the non-uniformity of vertical distribution. Therefore, dense vegetation corresponding to a large damping factor will postpone the time when Taylor's dispersion model holds, and the first order approximation becomes rough on small time scale, demanding higher order modifications.

The rill detachment rate is the fundamental basis for determination of the parameters of a rill erosion model. In this paper, an analytical method was proposed to estimate the rill detachment rate. The method is based on the exact analytical solution of rill erosion to the differential equation of rill detachment. The rill sediment concentration distribution as a function of rill length was identified through laboratory experiments under different slope gradients and flow rates. The sediment concentration processes from experiments on loess and purple rills were considered to estimate the rill detachment rates of both soils analytically. They were respectively used as a function of rill length and sediment concentration. The analytical detachment rates were compared with the numerically determined values to verify the analytical methods. The rill detachment rates of the two soils under different flow rates and slope gradients estimated by the analytical method were further compared on the basis of detachment-sediment function and detachment-rill length function. Results indicated that the analytically estimated values were very close to the numerically estimated values. Numerical and analytical methods were equally useful for rill detachment rate estimation. Therefore, the analytical method was verified to be rational and applicable for the rapid determination of the rill detachment rates based on either sediment concentration or rill length. The analytical detachment values of purple and loess soils suggested that the detachment rates of loess soil were significantly and considerably higher than those of purple soil. The erosion potentials of loess soil were also significant higher than those of purple soil. The differences in the erosion of the two soils decreased as the slope gradient and flow rate increased. These observations implied that the degree of loess soil erosion was greater than that of purple soil erosion at low slope gradients and flow rates. The factors causing these differences may be determined in terms of the properties of the two soils. Therefore, the proposed analytical method, in addition to the concepts and direct relationship to erosion process, could be applied to obtain the rill detachment rate for the determination of rill erosion model parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:05:09","2018-01-20 00:05:09","","236-243","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Loess soils; Sedimentation; Sediments; concentration (composition); comparative study; Differential equations; analytical method; Numerical methods; Erosion; experimental study; Soils; soil erosion; Flow rate; loess; soil type; Analytical method; Purple soils; rill; Rill detachment; Rill erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors develop a conceptual model of sediment carbon fate in karst terrain with specific emphasis upon phreatic karst conduits, i.e., those located below the groundwater table that have the potential to trap surface-derived sediment and turnover carbon. To assist with their conceptual model development, the authors study a phreatic system and apply a mixture of methods traditional and novel to karst studies, including electrical resistivity imaging, well drilling, instantaneous velocimetry, dye tracing, stage recording, discrete and continuous sediment and water quality sampling, and elemental and stable carbon isotope fingerprinting. Results show that the sediment transport carrying capacity of the phreatic karst water is orders of magnitude less than surface streams during storm-activated periods promoting deposition of fine sediments in the phreatic karst. However, the sediment transport carrying capacity is sustained long after the hydrologic event has ended leading to sediment resuspension and prolonged transport. The surficial fine grained laminae occurs in the subsurface karst system; but unlike surface streams, the light-limited conditions of the subsurface karst promotes constant heterotrophy leading to carbon turnover. The coupling of the hydrological processes leads to a conceptual model that frames phreatic karst as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that recharges degraded organic carbon back to surface streams. For example, fluvial sediment is estimated to lose 30% of its organic carbon by mass during a one year temporary residence within the phreatic karst. It is recommended that scientists consider karst pathways when attempting to estimate organic matter stocks and carbon transformation in fluvial networks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:05:24","2018-01-20 00:05:24","","179-193","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Groundwater; conceptual framework; model test; Landforms; organic carbon; Organic carbon; Stream flow; karst; resuspension; Sediment re suspensions; sediment analysis; isotopic analysis; carbon isotope; alluvial deposit; deposition; sediment chemistry; Imaging techniques; Fingerprinting; Electrical resistivity imaging; Fluviokarst; Heterotrophic respiration; Karst conduit; respiration; Sediment organic carbon; Stable carbon isotopes; Well drilling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TDR is one of the standard methods used for determining water content in soil samples. In this study, we present an approach to estimate water retention parameters of a sample which is initially saturated and subjected to an incremental decrease in boundary head causing it to drain in a multi-step fashion. TDR waveforms are measured along the height of the sample at assumed different hydrostatic conditions at daily interval. The cumulative discharge outflow drained from the sample is also recorded. The saturated water content is obtained using volumetric analysis after the final step involved in multi-step drainage. The equation obtained by coupling the unsaturated parametric function and the apparent dielectric permittivity is fitted to a TDR wave propagation forward model. The unsaturated parametric function is used to spatially interpolate the water contents along TDR probe. The cumulative discharge outflow data is fitted with cumulative discharge estimated using the unsaturated parametric function. The weight of water inside the sample estimated at the first and final boundary head in multi-step drainage is fitted with the corresponding weights calculated using unsaturated parametric function. A Bayesian optimization scheme is used to obtain optimized water retention parameters for these different objective functions. This approach can be used for samples with long heights and is especially suitable for characterizing sands with a uniform particle size distribution at low capillary heads. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:05:52","2018-01-20 00:05:52","","404-415","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","interpolation; parameter estimation; water content; Parameter estimation; Hydraulics; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; quantitative analysis; waveform analysis; Spatial interpolation; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Water content; Time domain reflectometry; Time domain analysis; time domain reflectometry; water retention; phreatic zone; size distribution; outflow; Wave propagation; Hydrostatic conditions; hydrostatics; Multi-step; Permittivity; Volumetric analysis; Water retention parameter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a complement to the recently published EMFX model, a method based on two specific suction conditions is proposed to estimate saturated film conductivity from the soil water retention curve. This method reduces one fitting parameter in the previous EMFX model, making it possible to predict the hydraulic conductivity from the soil water retention curve over the complete moisture range. Model performance is evaluated with published data of soils in a broad texture range from sand to clay. The testing results indicate that 1) the modified EMFX model (namely the EMFX-K model), incorporating both capillary and adsorption forces, provides good agreement with the conductivity data over the entire moisture range; 2) a value of 0.5 for the tortuosity factor in the EMFX-K model as that in the Mualem's model gives comparable estimation of the relative conductivity associated with the capillary force; and 3) a value of −1.0 × 10−20 J for the Hamaker constant, rather than the commonly used value of −6.0 × 10−20 J, appears to be more appropriate to represent solely the effect of the van der Waals forces and to predict the film conductivity. In comparison with the commonly used van Genuchten-Mualem model, the EMFX-K model significantly improves the prediction of hydraulic conductivity under dry conditions. The sensitivity analysis result suggests that the uncertainty in the film thickness estimation is important in explaining the model underestimation of hydraulic conductivity for the soils with fine texture, in addition to the uncertainties from the measurements and the model structure. High quality data that cover the complete moisture range for a variety of soil textures are required to further test the method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:06:06","2018-01-20 00:06:06","","38-49","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Forecasting; Soil hydraulic properties; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Curve fitting; hydraulic conductivity; Moisture; moisture content; Moisture determination; unsaturated medium; Van Genuchten-Mualem models; Soil testing; Hydraulic conductivity; water retention; saturation; Porous materials; porosity; Unsaturated porous media; Soil water retention curves; Film conductivity; Film flows; Fitting parameters; Thickness measurement; Tortuosity factor; Van der Waals forces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a methodology called Hydrological Retrospective (HR), which essentially simulates large rainfall datasets, using this as input into hydrological models to develop a record of past hydrology, making it possible to analyze past floods and droughts. We developed a methodology for the Amazon basin, where studies have shown an increase in the intensity and frequency of hydrological extreme events in recent decades. We used eight large precipitation datasets (more than 30 years) as input for a large scale hydrological and hydrodynamic model (MGB-IPH). HR products were then validated against several in situ discharge gauges controlling the main Amazon sub-basins, focusing on maximum and minimum events. For the most accurate HR, based on performance metrics, we performed a forecast skill of HR to detect floods and droughts, comparing the results with in-situ observations. A statistical temporal series trend was performed for intensity of seasonal floods and droughts in the entire Amazon basin. Results indicate that HR could represent most past extreme events well, compared with in-situ observed data, and was consistent with many events reported in literature. Because of their flow duration, some minor regional events were not reported in literature but were captured by HR. To represent past regional hydrology and seasonal hydrological extreme events, we believe it is feasible to use some large precipitation datasets such as i) climate reanalysis, which is mainly based on a land surface component, and ii) datasets based on merged products. A significant upward trend in intensity was seen in maximum annual discharge (related to floods) in western and northwestern regions and for minimum annual discharge (related to droughts) in south and central-south regions of the Amazon basin. Because of the global coverage of rainfall datasets, this methodology can be transferred to other regions for better estimation of future hydrological behavior and its impact on society. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:06:18","2018-01-20 00:06:18","","667-684","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; discharge; drought; rainfall; ecohydrology; data set; land surface; Hydrological models; Hydrological extremes; seasonality; Drought; hydrological modeling; Floods; hydrodynamics; water flow; model validation; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; extreme event; flood; historical record; climate conditions; In-situ observations; Amazon Basin; Amazon basin; decadal variation; Hydrological Retrospective; Reanalysis; Regional hydrologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Water samples from 36 geothermal wells have been collected in the main urban area of Chongqing. Chemical types of the thermal water samples are Ca·Mg-SO4 and Ca-SO4. High contents of Ca2+ and SO4 2− in the thermal water samples are derived from the dissolution of evaporates. Furthermore, the HCO3 − concentration is constrained by the common ion effect. Drilling depth has no effect on the physical and chemical characteristics according to the results of a t-test. The geothermal reservoir's temperature can be estimated to be 64.8–93.4 °C (average 82 °C) using quartz and improved SiO2 geothermometers. Values of δD and δ18O for the thermal water samples indicate that the thermal water resources originate from local precipitation with a recharge elevation between 838 and 1130 m and an annual air temperature between 10.4 and 13.9 °C. A conceptual model of regional scale groundwater flow for the thermal water is proposed. The thermal water mainly originates from the meteoric water recharged in the elevated areas of northeastern Tongluoshan and Huayingshan by means of percolation through exposed carbonate before becoming groundwater. The groundwater is heated at depth and moves southwest along the fault and the anticlinal core in a gravity-driven regime.

Therefore, a physically based nitrogen transport model was developed and tested with the so called semi-field experiments (i.e., artificial rainfall was used instead of natural rainfall, but other conditions were natural) in this paper. Our model integrated the raindrop driven process and diffusion effect with the simplified nitrogen chain reactions. In this model, chemicals in the soil surface layer, or the ‘exchange layer’, were transformed into the surface runoff layer due to raindrop impact. The raindrops also have a significant role on the diffusion process between the exchange layer and the underlying soil. The established mathematical model was solved numerically through the modified Hydrus-1d source code, and the model simulations agreed well with the experimental data. The modeling results indicate that the depth of the exchange layer and raindrop induced water transfer rate are two important parameters for the simulation results. Variation of the water transfer rate, er, can strongly influence the peak values of the NO− 3-N and NH+ 4-N concentration breakthrough curves. The concentration of NO− 3-N is more sensitive to the exchange layer depth, de, than NH+ 4-N. In general, the developed model well describes the nitrogen loss into surface runoff in a raindrop driven process. Since the raindrop splash erosion process may aggravate the loss of chemical fertilizer, choosing an appropriate fertilization time and application method is very important to prevent the pollution. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:06:44","2018-01-20 00:06:44","","754-768","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; rainfall; Pollution; concentration (composition); numerical model; runoff; nitrogen; Nitrogen; pollutant transport; experimental study; Pollution control; Soils; Fertilizers; mass transfer; Spatial heterogeneity; nutrient dynamics; agricultural land; Surface runoffs; precipitation intensity; nonpoint source pollution; Agricultural runoff; water pollution; breakthrough curve; water depth; Break through curve; Drops; HYDRUS-1D; Nonpoint pollutions; Chemical fertilizers; Raindrop impact; Soil pollution control; Soil surface layers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the dry season (November–April) the lake drains through a tributary to the Mekong River. The flow in the connecting tributary completely reverses during the wet monsoon (May–October), adding huge volumes of water back to the lake, increasing its area about six fold. The lake is likely phosphorus limited and we hypothesized that groundwater discharge, including recirculated lake water, may represent an important source of P and other nutrients. To address this question, we surveyed hundreds of kilometers of the lake for natural 222Rn (radon), temperature, conductivity, GPS coordinates and water depth. All major inorganic nutrients and phosphorus species were evaluated by systematic sampling throughout the lake. Results showed that there were radon hotspots, all at the boundaries between the permanent lake and the floodplain, indicating likely groundwater inputs. A radon mass balance model indicates that the groundwater flow to Tonle Sap Lake is approximately 10 km3/yr, about 25% as large as the floodwaters entering from the Mekong River during the wet monsoon. Our results suggest that the groundwater-derived dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) contribution to Tonle Sap is more than 30% of the average inflows from all natural sources. Since the productivity of the lake appears to be phosphorus limited, this finding suggests that the role of groundwater is significant for Tonle Sap Lake and perhaps for other flood pulse systems worldwide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:06:56","2018-01-20 00:06:56","","79-91","","","549","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","discharge; dry season; groundwater; Groundwater flow; Floods; Groundwater; Water; sampling; lake water; Lakes; Ground water discharge; nutrient dynamics; Nutrients; Atmospheric thermodynamics; phosphorus; Phosphorus; water chemistry; Discharge (fluid mechanics); mass balance; GPS; dissolved inorganic phosphorus; source identification; Radon; Cambodia; Dissolved inorganic phosphorus; Flood pulse; geological theory; Inorganic nutrients; Mekong River; Phosphorus dynamics; radon; Radon mass balances; Systematic sampling; Tonle Sap Lake; Tonle saps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our literature review examines in detail the links between mean, high and low flows in CE and large-scale circulation patterns, with focus on two closely related phenomena, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Western-zonal circulation (WC). For both patterns, significant relations, consistent between different studies, are found for large parts of CE. The strongest links are found for the winter season, forming a dipole-like pattern with positive relationships with streamflow north of the Alps and the Carpathians for both indices and negative relationships for the NAO in the south. An influence of winter NAO is also detected in the amplitude and timing of snowmelt flows later in the year. Discharge in CE has further been linked to other large-scale climatic modes such as the Scandinavia pattern (SCA), the East Atlantic/West Russian pattern (EA/WR), the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and synoptic weather patterns such as the Vb weather regime. Different mechanisms suggested in the literature to modulate links between streamflow and the NAO are combined with topographical characteristics of the target area in order to explain the divergent NAO/WC influence on streamflow in different parts of CE. In particular, a precipitation mechanism seems to regulate winter flows in North-Western Germany, an area with short duration of snow cover and with rainfall-generated floods. The precipitation mechanism is also likely in Southern CE, where correlations between the NAO and temperature are low. Finally, in the rest of the study area (Northern CE, Alpine region), a joint precipitation-snow mechanism influences floods not only in winter, but also in the spring/snowmelt period, providing some possibilities for flood forecasting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:07:08","2018-01-20 00:07:08","","484-500","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Central Europe; Germany; North Atlantic Oscillation; Snow; atmospheric circulation; river discharge; streamflow; teleconnection; Climatology; topography; Spatial patterns; Teleconnection indices; flow pattern; Floods; Flood control; Atmospheric movements; Precipitation (meteorology); Stream flow; snowmelt; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; Atmospheric pressure; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Atmospheric circulation; Oscillating flow; North Atlantic oscillations; atmosphere-ocean coupling; Large-scale circulation patterns; circulation; Precipitation mechanism; Synoptic weather patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The influence of vegetation type on groundwater level fluctuations and evapotranspiration has rarely been quantified for contrasting plant communities concurrently although it has implications for downstream water yield and quality. Hourly groundwater evapotranspiration (ETG) rates were estimated for grass and tree riparian vegetation in southwestern Manitoba, Canada using two modified White methods. Groundwater table depth was monitored in four 21 m transects of five 3 m deep monitoring wells in the riparian zone of a stream reach including tree (Acer negundo; boxelder) and grass (Bromus inermis; smooth brome) dominated segments. The average depths to the groundwater table from the surface were 1.4 m and 1 m for the tree and grass segments, respectively, over the two-year study. During rain free periods of the growing season ETG was estimated for a total of 70 days in 2014 and 79 days in 2015 when diurnal fluctuations were present in groundwater level. Diurnal groundwater level fluctuations were observed during dry periods under both segments, however, ETG was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) under trees compared to grass cover in 2014 (a wet year with 72% higher than normal growing season precipitation) and 2015 (a drier year with 15% higher than normal growing season precipitation). The two methods used to estimate ETG produced similar daily and seasonal values for the two segments. In 2014, total ETG was approximately 50% (148 mm) and 100% (282–285 mm) of reference evapotranspiration (ETref, 281 mm) for the grass and tree segments, respectively. In 2015, total ETG was approximately 40% (106–127 mm) and 120% (369–374 mm) of ETref (307 mm) for the grass and tree segments, respectively. Results from the study show the tree dominated portions of the stream reach consumed approximately 2.4 ML ha−1 yr−1 more groundwater than a common forage grass. These findings have land management implications for regional water budgets during wet periods when flood mitigation is desirable and dry years when water scarcity is a concern. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:07:19","2018-01-20 00:07:19","","654-666","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Vegetation; evapotranspiration; groundwater; Groundwater; analytical method; Canada; Catchments; Forestry; Budget control; riparian zone; water level; agricultural catchment; water budget; riparian vegetation; grass; water yield; vegetation type; Manitoba; temperate environment; tree; Riparian; Acer negundo; Bromus inermis; Phreatophytes; White methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The three catchments were representative of the montane rain-snow transition zone (snow was 39% of total precipitation; σ (standard deviation) = 10%), the subalpine zone (69% snow; σ = 5%), and the alpine zone (84% snow; σ = 10%). All three catchments were identified as three end-member systems with their respective source waters being groundwater, snow precipitation or melt, rain (montane and subalpine only), and subsurface water from talus slopes (alpine only). Mean annual groundwater contributions were greater in forested catchments (28%; σ = 6% in the montane, 31%; σ = 8% in the subalpine) than in the alpine (19%; σ = 5%) catchment. Snow-derived water contributions to streamflow were inversely related to groundwater and increased with elevation from 46% (σ = 15%) in the montane zone to 58% (σ = 12%) in the subalpine and 61% (σ = 7%) in the alpine. Rain was 27% (σ = 8%) of discharge in the montane and 11% (σ = 4%) in the subalpine, while talus waters made up the final 21% (σ = 12%) of streamflow in the alpine.

This study proposes the mixed physical barrier (MPB) as a new barrier system for seawater intrusion control, which combines an impermeable cutoff wall and a semi-permeable subsurface dam. The effect of the traditionally-used physical barriers on transient saltwater wedge dynamics was first explored for various hydraulic gradients, and the workability of the MPB was thereafter thoroughly analysed. A newly developed automated image analysis based on light-concentration conversion was used in the experiments, which were completed in a porous media tank. The numerical code SEAWAT was used to assess the consistency of the experimental data and examine the sensitivity of the performance of the barriers to various key parameters. The results show that the MPB induced a visible lifting of the dense saline flux upward towards the outlet by the light freshwater. This saltwater lifting mechanism, observed for the first time, induced significant reduction to the saline water intrusion length. The use of the MPB yielded up to 62% and 42% more reduction of the saltwater intrusion length than the semi-permeable dam and the cutoff wall, respectively. The performance achieved by the MPB with a wall depth of 40% of the aquifer thickness was greater than that of a single cutoff wall with a penetration depth of 90% of the aquifer thickness (about 13% extra reduction). This means that the MPB could produce better seawater intrusion reduction than the traditionally used barriers at even lower cost. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:07:41","2018-01-20 00:07:41","","416-427","","","549","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; Aquifers; Mercury (metal); saline intrusion; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Saline water; freshwater environment; Hydraulic gradients; dam; coastal aquifer; Saline water intrusion; salinization; Porous materials; seawater; Physical barriers; Coastal aquifers; Salinization; freshwater input; Automated image analysis; cutoff wall; Lifting mechanisms; Light concentration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most common methods of estimating catchment-scale ETa are remote sensing and hydrological models. These methods have limitations when applied at the catchment scale due to coarse resolutions of data and uncertainties in model predictions. Data assimilation techniques that combine complementary information from hydrological models and observed data can overcome some of the limitations. These techniques have been used in many hydrological modeling studies, but few have applied data assimilation to ETa within a distributed precipitation-runoff catchment modeling framework. This paper proposes a catchment scale ETa data assimilation technique (termed ET-DA) that assimilates remotely sensed ETa data into a distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (DTVGM-ET) for improving hydrological model simulations. The DTVGM-ET improved the ETa computation on the basis of a nonlinear soil water availability function to establish an explicit time response relationship between ETa and soil moisture for implementing the ETa assimilation. The proposed ET-DA system was tested in the Upper Huai River Basin (UHRB), China using data from 2000 to 2012. Through synthetic simulation experiments, the capability of ET-DA for obtaining accurate, continuous time series of ETa estimates and achieving assimilation feedback on soil moisture and streamflow was examined. The results demonstrated that ET-DA provided improved regional ETa monitoring capability, and assimilation of ETa into the hydrological model led to improved model predictions of soil moisture and streamflow. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:07:53","2018-01-20 00:07:53","","685-702","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; evapotranspiration; hydrological cycle; rainfall-runoff modeling; soil moisture; streamflow; remote sensing; data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Bandpass filters; Data assimilation; Watersheds; Remote sensing; model test; Catchments; Hydrology; Soil moisture; Soils; time series; Kalman filter; ensemble forecasting; monitoring; Stream flow; Actual evapotranspiration; Moisture; Distributed hydrological model; Continuous time systems; Kalman filters; Monitoring capabilities; Data assimilation techniques; DTVGM-ET; Huai River; Huai rivers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nine sensors, which were 1 m apart along the 8 m long rill, were used to measure flow velocity by tracing solute transport. Measured flow velocity increased with slope gradient and flow rate. The highest increase in flow velocity was measured from 15° to 20° which were also affected by flow rate. Effects of discharge rate on flow velocity presented the largest difference when flow rate increased from 2 L/min to 8 L/min at slope gradients higher than 5°. The effects of different factors were quantified by a regression model with high accuracy of 0.99. Maximum flow velocity of water was predicted at 15.23% of stone content. Flow velocity increased with 0–15.23% of stone content but decreased at higher values.

Recently, Zeng and Cai (2015) proposed a decomposition framework of the E variance, based on water balance and the Budyko hypothesis. On the basis of a long-term (1960–2008) land surface dataset, this study applies the theoretical framework to assess the effects of climate and terrestrial storage factors on the interannual and intra-annual variance in E across China. An error decomposition framework is developed to quantify the key factors in the error of the predicted E variance. The results show that the prediction of the E variance is more accurate in arid climates than in humid climates, and the corresponding error is primarily controlled by the variability of precipitation (P) and runoff (R). Climate is the primary source for the E variance, and the dominant sources shift from potential evaporation (PET) in humid climates to P in arid climates. The interactions between P and PET tend to dampen the E interannual variance and enhance the E intra-annual variance, and this effect is especially significant in humid climates. Terrestrial storage change is more capable of accommodating climatic fluctuations at the intra-annual scale than at the interannual scale, and for some arid regions it is the dominant factor influencing the E variance. The response of terrestrial storage to P is more significant than its response to PET, especially for regions with strong human impact. Neglecting the effects of terrestrial storage would possibly underestimate or overestimate the E variance in both humid and arid climates, due to the interactions between climate and the change in the terrestrial storage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:08:15","2018-01-20 00:08:15","","388-403","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Potential evaporation; equation; potential evapotranspiration; Water balance; land surface; temporal analysis; Surface measurement; runoff; error analysis; Errors; precipitation assessment; climate effect; water budget; annual variation; Actual evapotranspiration; Temporal variability; humid environment; Theoretical framework; Budyko equation; Climatic fluctuations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper comprehensively evaluates four widely used non-tracer baseflow separation methods against tracer-based hydrograph separation for five Eastern Australian catchments. The four methods include United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) method and three digital filtering methods: Lyne–Hollick method, Chapman–Maxwell method and Eckhardt method. The first two filtering methods include a parameter of recession constant, and the last one has two parameters: the recession constant and the maximum baseflow index. We used an Automatic Baseflow Identification Technique (ABIT) to estimate the recession constant, which varies from 0.943 to 0.987 for the five catchments that is evidently higher than the default value of 0.925, and used the default Eckhardt and UKIH methods to estimate the maximum baseflow index, respectively. All modelling results are evaluated against the tracer-based hydrograph separation. Using the recession constant estimated from the ABIT method performs noticeably better than using the default parameter, indicated by the absolute bias reduced about 20% in average. For the two-parameter Eckhardt method, estimating the maximum baseflow index has larger effect on baseflow separation than estimating the recession constant. Compared to the different parameterisation schemes, the difference among the improved non-tracer methods is small. Using multiple passes into the Lyne–Hollick method can only slightly improve or deteriorate baseflow index estimates. Our results suggest that it is critical to get appropriate parameter(s) before applying the digital filtering methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:08:26","2018-01-20 00:08:26","","252-263","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; catchment; streamflow; hydrological modeling; Parameter estimation; automation; Catchments; hydrograph; subsurface flow; Stream flow; tracer; baseflow; Hydrograph separation; separation; Base flow index; Baseflow separations; Digital filtering; Recession constant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this simplification is appropriate to simulate transport in the saturated zone, it can result in significant errors when modeling gas phase transport in the vadose zone, as might be applied when simulating a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system to remediate vadose zone contamination. A new analytical solution for the equations describing radial gas phase transport of a sorbing contaminant to an extraction well is presented. The equations model advection, dispersion (including both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion), and rate-limited mass transfer of dissolved, separate phase, and sorbed contaminants into the gas phase. The model equations are analytically solved by using the Laplace transform with respect to time. The solutions are represented by confluent hypergeometric functions in the Laplace domain. The Laplace domain solutions are then evaluated using a numerical Laplace inversion algorithm. The solutions can be used to simulate the spatial distribution and the temporal evolution of contaminant concentrations during operation of a soil vapor extraction well. Results of model simulations show that the effect of gas phase molecular diffusion upon concentrations at the extraction well is relatively small, although the effect upon the distribution of concentrations in space is significant. This study provides a tool that can be useful in designing SVE remediation strategies, as well as verifying numerical models used to simulate SVE system performance. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:08:38","2018-01-20 00:08:38","","452-460","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; numerical model; Extraction; extraction method; numerical method; analytical method; spatial distribution; Diffusion; soil water; Soils; vadose zone; pollutant removal; Soil pollution; Mass transfer; Soil conservation; diffusion; water vapor; Dispersions; Gases; Porous materials; Laplace transform; Laplace transforms; temporal evolution; Remediation; Diffusion in liquids; Integral equations; Impurities; remediation; Contaminant concentrations; Diffusion in solids; phase transition; Confluent hypergeometric functions; Integral transform; Laplace-domain solution; Mechanical dispersion; Numerical Laplace inversion; Remediation strategies; Soil vapor extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have carefully examined such assumptions by developing a new finite-difference model of the SWPP test under the transient Forchheimer flow condition, considering the wellbore storage. The SWPP test included an injection phase, a chaser phase, a rest phase, and an extraction phase. The results showed that the concentration of the steady-state flow solution was greater than that of the transient flow solution at the beginning, and its peak value was also greater than that of the transient flow solution. The difference between the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the transient flow SWPP model and the steady-state flow SWPP model was not negligible, and such a difference increased with the decreasing specific storage.

While the spatial distribution of nitrate sources has been delineated in many watersheds, less is known about the complicated temporal dynamics that drive stream NOx-N because traditional methods of stream grab sampling are often conducted at a low frequency. Deployment of accurate real-time, continuous measurement devices that have been developed in recent years enables high-frequency sampling that provides detailed information on the concentration-discharge relation and the timing of NOx-N delivery to streams. We aggregated 15-min interval NOx-N and discharge data over a nine-year period into daily averages and then used robust statistical methods to identify how the discharge regime within an artificially-drained agricultural watershed reflected catchment hydrology and NOx-N delivery pathways. We then quantified how transport and supply limitations varied from year-to-year and how dependence of these limitations varied with climate, especially drought. Our results show NOx-N concentrations increased linearly with discharge up to an average “turning point” of 1.42 mm of area-normalized discharge, after which concentrations decline with increasing discharge. We estimate transport and supply limitations to govern 57 and 43 percent, respectively, of the NOx-N flux over the nine-year period. Drought effects on the NOx-N flux linger for multiple years and this is reflected in a greater tendency toward supply limitations in the three years following drought. How the turning point varies with climate may aid in prediction of NOx-N loading in future climate regimes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:09:01","2018-01-20 00:09:01","","581-591","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; catchment; discharge; drought; water supply; water quality; Drought; concentration (composition); nitrate; Agriculture; watershed; spatial distribution; Catchments; Continuous measurements; Digital storage; Nitrates; agricultural land; stream; drainage; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural watersheds; inorganic nitrogen; High-frequency sampling; nitrogen compound; Robust statistical method; Supply-limited; Tile; Transport-limited; Turning points","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is estimated that around 1.7 million people are heavily dependent on water derived from karst springs in southwest China. However, there is a limited amount of water supply in this region. Moreover, there is not enough information on temporal patterns of spring discharge in the area. In this context, it is essential to accurately predict spring discharge, as well as understand karst hydrological processes in a thorough manner, so that water shortages in this area could be predicted and managed efficiently. The objectives of this study were to determine the primary factors that govern spring discharge patterns and to develop a state-space model to predict spring discharge. Spring discharge, precipitation (PT), relative humidity (RD), water temperature (WD), and electrical conductivity (EC) were the variables analyzed in the present work, and they were monitored at two different locations (referred to as karst springs A and B, respectively, in this paper) in a karst catchment area in southwest China from May to November 2015. Results showed that a state-space model using any combinations of variables outperformed a classical linear regression, a back-propagation artificial neural network model, and a least square support vector machine in modeling spring discharge time series for karst spring A. The best state-space model was obtained by using PT and RD, which accounted for 99.9% of the total variation in spring discharge. This model was then applied to an independent data set obtained from karst spring B, and it provided accurate spring discharge estimates. Therefore, state-space modeling was a useful tool for predicting spring discharge in karst regions in southwest China, and this modeling procedure may help researchers to obtain accurate results in other karst regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:09:10","2018-01-20 00:09:10","","264-276","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; artificial neural network; catchment; discharge; prediction; spatial analysis; Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Hydraulic models; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); Backpropagation; Neural networks; Support vector machines; karst hydrology; Water supply; model test; Catchments; Landforms; Hydrological process; precipitation (climatology); Deep neural networks; water temperature; State space methods; support vector machine; hydraulics; electrical conductivity; Electrical conductivity; Precipitation (chemical); Earth (planet); relative humidity; Critical zones; Hydraulic machinery; spring (hydrology); Karst springs; Springs (water); Earth; Karst hydrology; Least square support vector machines; State - space models; Vector spaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study attempts to investigate factors potentially driving changes in different streamflow components defined by different quantiles. The data used were daily streamflow data for the 1959–2005 period from 5 hydrological stations, daily precipitation and temperature data from 77 meteorological stations and data pertaining to cropland and large reservoirs. Results indicate a general decrease in streamflow across the Yellow River basin. Moreover significant decreasing streamflow has been observed in the middle and lower Yellow River basin with change points during the mid-1980s till the mid-1990s. The changes of cropland affect the streamflow components and also the cumulative effects on streamflow variations. Recent years have witnessed moderate cropland variations which result in moderate streamflow changes. Further, precipitation also plays a critical role in changes of streamflow components and human activities, i.e. cropland changes, temperature changes and building of water reservoirs, tend to have increasing impacts on hydrological processes across the Yellow River basin.

In climate science, there is a general consensus that all climate models should be considered as having equal performance or in other words that all projections are equiprobable. On the other hand, in the impacts and adaptation community, many believe that climate models should be weighted based on their ability to better represent various metrics over a reference period. The debate appears to be partly philosophical in nature as few studies have investigated the impact of using weights in projecting future climate changes. The present study focuses on the impact of assigning weights to climate models for hydrological climate change studies. Five methods are used to determine weights on an ensemble of 28 global climate models (GCMs) adapted from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) database. Using a hydrological model, streamflows are computed over a reference (1961–1990) and future (2061–2090) periods, with and without post-processing climate model outputs. The impacts of using different weighting schemes for GCM simulations are then analyzed in terms of ensemble mean and uncertainty. The results show that weighting GCMs has a limited impact on both projected future climate in term of precipitation and temperature changes and hydrology in terms of nine different streamflow criteria. These results apply to both raw and post-processed GCM model outputs, thus supporting the view that climate models should be considered equiprobable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:09:36","2018-01-20 00:09:36","","534-546","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; database; streamflow; climate modeling; Global climate model; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Climate change impact; climate effect; hydrometeorology; Climate model simulations; Hydrological climate change; Stream flow; CMIP; Philosophical aspects; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Impacts and adaptation; Temperature changes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steps are as follows: (1) the original low flow without human activities is assumed to follow a Pearson type three distribution, (2) the probability distribution of climatic dry spell periods is derived based on a base flow recession model, (3) the base flow recession model is updated under human activities, and (4) the low flow distribution under human activities is obtained based on the derived probability distribution of dry spell periods and the updated base flow recession model. Linear and nonlinear reservoir models are used to describe the base flow recession, respectively. The Wudinghe basin is chosen for the case study, with daily streamflow observations during 1958–2000. Results show that human activities change the location parameter of the low flow frequency curve for the linear reservoir model, while alter the frequency distribution function for the nonlinear one.

We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km2) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km2 and 31 km2) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km2 headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter-site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (∼5 mg l−1). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (∼2 mg l−1) due to increased groundwater influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:10:00","2018-01-20 00:10:00","","220-235","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; catchment; connectivity; Scaling; Rivers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; runoff; Catchments; soil water; Digital storage; Carbon; Organic carbon; frequency analysis; Dynamics; Stream flow; Connectivity; Isotopes; isotopic fractionation; stable isotope; riparian vegetation; Wetlands; antecedent conditions; peatland; High frequency HF; baseflow; Biological materials; dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; headwater; isotopic analysis; mobilization; Peatland; Stable isotopes; organic soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fractal behaviour is quantified with three parts: a global scaling exponent, crossovers, and local scaling exponents. The robustness of the r-DFAn procedure is established by the systematic use of robust regression, piecewise linear regression, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and Multiple Comparison Procedure to determine statistically significant scaling exponents and optimum crossover locations.

Any decrease of the net mass of the lysimeter can be interpreted as evapotranspiration (ET), any increase as precipitation (P). However, the measured raw data need to be filtered to separate real mass changes from noise. Such filter routines typically apply two steps: (i) a low pass filter, like moving average, which smooths noisy data, and (ii) a threshold filter that separates significant from insignificant mass changes. Recent developments of these filters have identified and solved some problems regarding bias in the data processing. A remaining problem is that each change in flow direction is accompanied with a systematic flow underestimation due to the threshold scheme. In this contribution, we analyze this systematic effect and show that the absolute underestimation is independent of the magnitude of a flux event. Thus, for small events, like dew or rime formation, the relative error is high and can reach the same magnitude as the flux itself. We develop a heuristic solution to the problem by introducing a so-called “snap routine”. The routine is calibrated and tested with synthetic flux data and applied to real measurements obtained with a precision lysimeter for a 10-month period. The heuristic snap routine effectively overcomes these problems and yields an almost unbiased representation of the real signal. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:10:24","2018-01-20 00:10:24","","731-740","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; evapotranspiration; lysimeter; data processing; Bandpass filters; Data handling; precipitation assessment; Soil surveys; water budget; precision; Precipitation measurement; Lysimeters; Data processing; dew; Heuristic solutions; Low pass filters; Precise measurements; Real measurements; Soil plant systems; Systematic effects; Threshold filter; Threshold schemes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

VEMALA v.3 simulates the transport and transformations of nitrate, ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate, particulate inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus, phytoplankton, suspended sediments and total organic carbon during their travel to the sea. The model's results were satisfactory in the Aurajoki river basin (South-Western Finland) in simulating nutrients daily loads, with all Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) ranging from 0.51 to 0.89 against observations, and monthly loads (NSE = 0.4–0.97 against estimations). Simulations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were comparable to estimated annual loads with the exception of a few exceptional years. The quantification of the nutrient cycling river processes were consistent with the Aurajoki river ecosystem with maximum summer rates for mineralisation 0.1 mgC L−1 d−1 and denitrification 55 mgN m−2 d−1 resulting in a loss of 4% of the annual nitrogen load entering the river. VEMALA v.3 unites the previous versions of VEMALA to better predict the co-impact of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate on algal growth and therefore eutrophication. Simulation of bioavailable nutrients rather than total nutrients will allow the distinction in the quality of the various loading sources, farming actions and loading reduction actions. In the Aurajoki simulation, nitrate and ammonium represented on average 74% and 3% respectively of the total nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea, while phosphate constituted 38% of the total phosphorus load to the sea.

However, in karst aquifers the development of vulnerability and RII maps is subject to explorational bias due to the impracticality of identifying all karst features within watersheds. The P3 method (Probability, Protection, and Precipitation) is proposed to minimize explorational bias through a decision tree model generated from probability maps and nearest neighbor analysis to assign a reduction in aquifer protection based on the probability of encountering karst features. This new method was used in conjunction with previously mapped hazards to assess the vulnerability and RII of nitrate contamination in 2 karst watersheds in semi-arid climate conditions. Validation of the P3 method was conducted with spring hydrographs, tracer tests, nitrate results, and output from a previously developed SWAT model. The maps generated with the P3 method were compared with maps generated from the COP method (Concentration of flow, Overlying layers, Precipitation) using known karst features as well as karst features inferred from analyzing a high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (COP-DEM method). Validation results show the P3 method most closely estimates the aquifer's vulnerability and RII by minimizing explorational bias. Conversely, the COP method using known karst features underestimates vulnerability and RII by not accounting for all karst features and the COP-DEM method overestimates vulnerability and RII due to false positives of karst features.

However, imprecise forecasting inflow may lead to output error and hinder implementation of power generation schedules. In this paper, output error generated by the uncertainty of the forecasting inflow was regarded as a variable to develop a short-term reservoir optimal operation model for reducing operation risk. To accomplish this, the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) was first applied to present the maximum possible loss of power generation schedules, and then an extreme value theory-genetic algorithm (EVT-GA) was proposed to solve the model. The cascade reservoirs of Yalong River Basin in China were selected as a case study to verify the model, according to the results, different assurance rates of schedules can be derived by the model which can present more flexible options for decision makers, and the highest assurance rate can reach 99%, which is much higher than that without considering output error, 48%. In addition, the model can greatly improve the power generation compared with the original reservoir operation scheme under the same confidence level and risk attitude. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper can significantly improve the effectiveness of power generation schedules and provide a more scientific reference for decision makers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:10:58","2018-01-20 00:10:58","","326-339","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; Water resources; optimization; reservoir; genetic algorithm; Optimization; risk assessment; decision making; uncertainty analysis; Genetic algorithms; Errors; Reservoirs (water); Value engineering; inflow; hydroelectric power; hydroelectric power plant; Hydroelectric power; operations technology; power generation; Cascade reservoirs; Hydroelectric power plants; Electric power transmission; Extreme value theory; mathematical theory; Output errors; Reservoir optimal operation; Value at Risk; Yalong Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our goal was to establish a reproducible, novel framework to evaluate the hydrological effect of vegetation on shallow landslides. This was achieved by accomplishing three objectives: (i) quantification in situ of the hydrological mechanisms by which woody vegetation (i.e. Salix sp.) might impact slope stability under wetting and drying conditions; (ii) to propose a new approach to predict plant-derived matric suctions under drying conditions; and (iii) to evaluate the suitability of the unified effective stress principle and framework (UES) to quantify the hydrological effect of vegetation against landslides. The results revealed that plant water uptake was the main hydrological mechanism contributing to slope stability, as the vegetated slope was, on average, 12.84% drier and had matric suctions three times higher than the fallow slope. The plant-related mechanisms under wetting conditions had a minimal effect on slope stability. The plant aerial parts intercepted up to 26.73% of the rainfall and concentrated a further 10.78% of it around the stem. Our approach successfully predicted the plant-derived matric suctions and UES proved to be adequate for evaluating the hydrological effect of vegetation on landslides. Although the UES framework presented here sets the basis for effectively evaluating the hydrological effect of vegetation on slope stability, it requires knowledge of the specific hydro-mechanical properties of plant-soil composites and this in itself needs further investigation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:11:13","2018-01-20 00:11:13","","374-387","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Vegetation; rainfall; landslide; Landslides; soil-vegetation interaction; water uptake; Hydrological effects; hydrological regime; woody plant; Stability; WETTING AND DRYING; Wetting; slope stability; Rainfall induced landslides; wetting-drying cycle; Slope stability; effective stress; Hydrological; hydromechanics; Matric suctions; Salix; Salix sp.; Slope protection; Slope stability analysis; stability analysis; Wetting conditions; Willow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, this study tries to answer the research questions as to whether the length of record of the historical data and its variability has any effect on the performance of the KSOM? Whether inclusion of temporal distribution of timeseries data and the nature of outliers in the KSOM framework enhances its performance further? Subsequently, it is established that the KSOM framework should include the coefficient of variation of the datasets for determination of the number of map units, without considering it as a single value function of the sample data size.

The imperfect representation of climate models introduces biases in the simulations that need to be corrected prior to their use for impact assessments. Bias correction methods generally assume that the bias calculated over the historical period does not change and can be applied to the future. This study investigates this assumption by considering the extent and nature of bias non-stationarity using 20th century precipitation and temperature simulations from six CMIP5 GCMs across Australia. Four statistics (mean, standard deviation, 10th and 90th quantiles) in monthly and seasonal biases are obtained for three different time window lengths (10, 25 and 33 years) to examine the properties of bias over time. This approach is repeated for two different phases of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), which is known to have strong influences on the Australian climate. It is found that bias non-stationarity at decadal timescales is indeed an issue over some of Australia for some GCMs. When considering interdecadal variability there are significant difference in the bias between positive and negative phases of the IPO. Regional analyses confirmed these findings with the largest differences seen on the east coast of Australia, where IPO impacts tend to be the strongest. The nature of the bias non-stationarity found in this study suggests that it will be difficult to modify existing bias correction approaches to account for non-stationary biases. A more practical approach for impact assessments that use bias correction maybe to use a selection of GCMs where the assumption of bias non-stationarity holds. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:11:38","2018-01-20 00:11:38","","148-162","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Non-stationarities; climate modeling; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; temporal analysis; Climate models; seasonal variation; assessment method; correction; CMIP; general circulation model; General circulation model; Bias-correction methods; Regional planning; decadal variation; Different time windows; GCM bias; Inter-decadal pacific oscillations; Inter-decadal variability; Temperature simulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, an experiment of long-term migration of the commonly used DNAPL, perchloroethylene (PCE), is performed in a two dimensional (2D) sandbox where several system variables including porosity, PCE saturation (Soil) and PCE-water interfacial area (AOW) are accurately quantified by light transmission techniques over the entire PCE migration process. Moreover, the REVs for these system variables are estimated by a criterion of relative gradient error (εg i) and results indicate that the frequency of minimum porosity-REV size closely follows a Gaussian distribution in the range of 2.0 mm and 8.0 mm. As experiment proceeds in PCE infiltration process, the frequency and cumulative frequency of both minimum Soil-REV and minimum AOW-REV sizes change their shapes from the irregular and random to the regular and smooth. When experiment comes into redistribution process, the cumulative frequency of minimum Soil-REV size reveals a linear positive correlation, while frequency of minimum AOW-REV size tends to a Gaussian distribution in the range of 2.0 mm–7.0 mm and appears a peak value in 13.0 mm–14.0 mm. Undoubtedly, this study will facilitate the quantification of REVs for materials and fluid properties in a rapid, handy and economical manner, which helps enhance our understanding of porous media and DNAPL properties at micro scale, as well as the accuracy of DNAPL contamination modeling at field-scale. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:11:51","2018-01-20 00:11:51","","12-26","","","549","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","pollutant transport; porous medium; composite; Gaussian distribution; Porosity; saturation; Porous materials; Interfacial areas; Heterogeneous porous media; Light transmission; Transmission techniques; Impurities; light intensity; Representative elementary volume; volume; Dense non-aqueous phase liquids; nonaqueous phase liquid; tetrachloroethylene; Contamination modeling; Cumulative frequencies; Redistribution process; Saturation (materials composition)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, armed with measurements of hourly interception intensity (i) from the field, this study is among the first to examine the differences in canopy interception dynamics between the first and second halves of rainfall events to quantify dynamic storage values for a coniferous forest in Japan. At this site, experimental results demonstrated that: (1) the relationship between interception loss (I) and gross rainfall (GR) at the event scale is better explained by a parabolic curve than a linear relationship, and there is a low correlation between rainfall intensity (gr) and i; (2) the ratio of accumulated i during the first half (IF) to that of gr (GRF) was larger than the second half (IS/GRS), with no significant correlations between potential evaporation during first half (PEF) vs IF or the second half (PES) vs IS; and (3) water storage capacity was similar to the magnitude of maximum I. By emphasizing the comparison between IF and IS, this study concludes that the water storage on tree surface is more important than losses by wet canopy evaporation and splash during rain.

Data and techniques that allow detailed identification and quantification of pyrite oxidation are therefore crucial for assessing and predicting the adverse water quality changes that may be associated with this process. In this study, we explore the benefits of combining stable sulphur isotope analysis with reactive transport modelling to improve the identification and characterisation of pyrite oxidation during an aquifer storage and recovery experiment in a chemically and physically heterogeneous aquifer. We characterise the stable sulphur isotope signal (δ34S) in both the ambient groundwater and the injectant as well as its spatial distribution within the sedimentary sulphur species. The identified stable sulphur isotope signal for pyrite was found to vary between −32 and +34‰, while the signal of the injectant ranged between +9.06 and +14.45‰ during the injection phase of the experiment. Both isotope and hydrochemical data together suggest a substantial contribution of pyrite oxidation to the observed, temporally variable δ34S signals. The variability of the δ34S signal in pyrite and the injectant were both found to complicate the analysis of the stable isotope data. However, the incorporation of the data into a numerical modelling approach allowed to successfully employ the δ34S signatures as a valuable additional constraint for identifying and quantifying the contribution of pyrite oxidation to the redox transformations that occur in response to the injection of oxygenated water. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:12:15","2018-01-20 00:12:15","","368-381","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; groundwater; Hydrogeology; water quality; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; spatial distribution; oxidation; Digital storage; reactive transport; Isotopes; stable isotope; Recharging (underground waters); Managed aquifer recharges; sediment analysis; Sedimentology; Water injection; Aquifer storage and recovery; Redox transformations; Heterogeneous aquifers; Stable-isotope analysis; Pyrites; Sulfur; trace element; Model-based analysis; Oxidation; pyrite; Pyrite oxidation; Reactive transport modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The safety and reliability of these repositories are a primary concern to environmental regulators and the public. Time-lapse oscillatory pumping test (OPT) has been introduced recently as a pressure-based technique for detecting potential leakage in geologic repositories. By routinely conducting OPT at a number of pulsing frequencies, an operator may identify the potential repository anomalies in the frequency domain, alleviating the ambiguity caused by reservoir noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Building on previous theoretical and field studies, this work performed a series of laboratory experiments to validate the concept of time-lapse OPT using a custom made, stainless steel tank under relatively high pressures. The experimental configuration simulates a miniature geologic storage repository consisting of three layers (i.e., injection zone, caprock, and above-zone aquifer). Results show that leakage in the injection zone led to deviations in the power spectrum of observed pressure data, and the amplitude of which also increases with decreasing pulsing frequencies. The experimental results are further analyzed by developing a 3D flow model, using which the model parameters are estimated through frequency domain inversion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:12:27","2018-01-20 00:12:27","","598-604","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","performance assessment; reservoir; Aquifers; testing method; experimental study; Digital storage; Carbon; carbon sequestration; laboratory method; geological survey; pumping; detection method; Frequency domain analysis; Pumping tests; Carbon sequestration; repository; Byproducts; Fiber optic sensors; Geologic repository; Leakage detection; Sandbox experiments; Signal to noise ratio; signal-to-noise ratio; Stainless steel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, in this multivariate setting, the verification of the above assumptions is often neglected.

A simulation study is performed to evaluate and compare the power of all these tests with hydrological constraints.

A striking new feature of the pumping test with an exponentially decayed rate is that the drawdowns will decrease over a certain period of time during intermediate pumping stage, which has never been seen before in constant-rate or constant-head pumping tests. It was found that the drawdown-time curve associated with an exponentially decayed pumping rate function was bounded by two asymptotic curves of the constant-rate tests with rates equaling to the starting and stabilizing rates, respectively.

Until now, flood characterization studies in the United States have been limited due to the lack of a comprehensive database matching flood characteristics such as peak discharges and flood duration with geospatial and geomorphologic information. The availability of a representative and long archive of flooding events spanning 78 years over a variety of hydroclimatic regions results in a spatially and temporally comprehensive flood characterization over the continental U.S. This study, for the first time, employs a large-event database that is based on actual National Weather Service (NWS) definitions of floods instead of the frequently-adopted case study or frequentist approach, allowing us to base our findings on real definitions of floods. It examines flooding characteristics to identify how space and time scales of floods vary with climatic regimes and geomorphology. Flood events were characterized by linking flood response variables in gauged basins to spatially distributed variables describing climatology, geomorphology, and topography. The primary findings of this study are that the magnitude of flooding is highest is regions such as West Coast and southeastern U.S. which experience the most extraordinary precipitation. The seasonality of flooding varies greatly from maxima during the cool season on the West Coast, warm season in the desert Southwest, and early spring in the Southeast. The fastest responding events tend to be in steep basins of the arid Southwest caused by intense monsoon thunderstorms and steep terrain. The envelope curves of unit peak discharge are consistent with those reported for Europe and worldwide. But significant seasonal variability was observed in floods of the U.S. compared to Europe that is attributed to the diversity of causative rainfall ranging from synoptic scales with orographic enhancements in the West Coast, monsoon thunderstorms in the desert Southwest, to land-falling tropical storms and localized, intense thunderstorms in the Southeast. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:13:03","2018-01-20 00:13:03","","524-535","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Europe; United States; river discharge; seasonality; climate change; Floods; flooding; fluvial geomorphology; Geomorphology; Landforms; peak discharge; Seasonal variability; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Thunderstorms; Flood characteristics; Characterization; National Weather Services; thunderstorm; Peak discharge; Characterization studies; Database matching; Orographic enhancement; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; Risetimes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several reasons could explain this mismatch, including the influence of layering, the mechanical parameters used in the predictions, or the relationship between settlements and drawdown. We analyze the influence of the above issues by investigating the mechanical response of pumped elastic porous media under different conditions. A radially symmetric conceptual model is considered and several hydro-mechanical simulations are performed varying the boundary conditions, the size of the modeled domain and the presence or not of an overlying layer. The simplicity of the considered problem allows us to compare our results with existing analytical solutions, to identify the role of each variable on pumping settlements and to generalize the results. The most relevant results are as follows: (1) settlements are proportional to drawdown only outside a circle of radius equal to 0.7 times the thickness of the pumped porous medium; inside, they are virtually constant, which leads to two simple procedures for computing pumping settlements.

Where possible, samples of in situ limestone were extracted from the spring outcrops, resulting in 30 measurements of local porosity, permeability, and hydraulic conductivity, which were conducted in the laboratory. There exist striking positive correlations between spring discharge and local limestone porosity, and between discharge and water hardness. X-ray diffraction and thin section analyses revealed the important role of rock mineralogy and texture, which may influence the porosity and permeability of the limestones. Samples taken from the eastern side of the valley showed greater degrees of secondary diagenesis, the products of which reduce effective porosity, providing a possible explanation for the depressed values of spring discharge there. In the study area, springs with higher discharges correlated strongly with higher spring water hardness and bedrock porosity. This suggests that water from the limestone matrix may contribute to the springs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:13:27","2018-01-20 00:13:27","","448-457","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United Kingdom; discharge; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; sampling; hydraulic conductivity; England; Limestone; limestone; water-rock interaction; Discharge measurements; permeability; Porosity; porosity; hydrogeochemistry; Minerals; spring (hydrology); Positive correlations; Hydro geochemistries; Aquifer rocks; Calcium carbonate; Cotswold Hills; Cotswolds; diagenesis; Hardness; Limestone porosities; oolite; Spring discharges; Water characteristics; Water hardness; X ray diffraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are caused not only by the frictional effect, but also by the kinematic effect, which consists of the accelerational and fluid inflow effects inside a wellbore. Existing models of flow to a partially penetrating vertical well assume either a uniform-flux boundary condition (UFBC) or a uniform-head boundary condition (UHBC) for treating the flow into the wellbore. Neither approach considers intra-wellbore losses. In this study a new general solution, named the mixed-type boundary condition (MTBC) solution, is introduced to include intra-wellbore losses. It is developed from the existing solutions using a hybrid analytical-numerical method. The MTBC solution is capable of modeling various types of aquifer tests (constant-head tests, constant-rate tests, and slug tests) for partially or fully penetrating vertical wells in confined aquifers. Results show that intra-wellbore losses (both frictional and kinematic) can be significant in the early pumping stage. At later pumping times the UHBC solution is adequate because the difference between the MTBC and UHBC solutions becomes negligible. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:13:38","2018-01-20 00:13:38","","333-341","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Testing; Hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; aquifer; Aquifers; water flow; Numerical methods; boundary condition; inflow; pumping; Friction; Boundary conditions; Confined aquifers; Oil field equipment; Kinematics; Analytical-numerical method; Aquifer tests; Frictional effects; General solutions; Mixed type boundary conditions; Partial penetration; penetration test; Vertical wells; wellhead","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the lack of field measurements, different methods have been proposed to estimate RZSM, including the use of exponential filters to predict RZSM from remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data. However, inconsistent findings about the controls on the optimal characteristic time length Topt, which is used in the exponential filter method, have been reported in the literature. To reconcile these inconsistent findings and further improve the use of the method, the impacts of soil properties and climatic conditions on Topt were assessed in this study using observed and modelled soil moisture datasets. Daily soil moisture data, daily meteorological records, and soil properties were retrieved from the Automated Weather Data Network (AWDN) and the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) within the continental United States. Data from the AWDN stations showed that Topt was mostly controlled by soil texture (e.g., a negative correlation with the sand fraction and a positive one with the clay fraction) as compared to climatic conditions. However, at SCAN stations, Topt was mostly affected by precipitation (P), and no significant correlation was found between Topt and soil texture. The difference in controlling factors between ADWN and SCAN stations can be largely attributed to the higher spatial variability in P across the SCAN stations, which overrode the impacts of soil properties on Topt. A 1-D vadose zone model was also utilized to simulate soil moisture at selected SCAN sites using a generated soil hydraulic parameter dataset. The simulation results further demonstrated the negative relationship between Topt and P observed for the SCAN stations. Moreover, the simulation results revealed that Topt was larger under vegetated conditions than under bare surface conditions. Under the same climatic conditions at each simulated site, which could be deemed as reduced variability in P, significant correlations existed between Topt and van Genuchten parameters. In particular, Topt was shown to be smaller for coarser soils, which was consistent with the results observed from AWDN stations. The findings of this study offer additional insights into the use of the exponential filter method for estimating RZSM from near surface soil moisture measurements. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:13:50","2018-01-20 00:13:50","","683-696","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climatic conditions; United States; soil moisture; spatial analysis; Bandpass filters; Soil moisture; Soils; vadose zone; precipitation assessment; Soil surveys; Moisture; Moisture determination; rhizosphere; climate conditions; Passive filters; soil property; soil texture; soil water potential; AWDN; SCAN; Exponential filters; Soil property; Soil water indices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, it is often limited by the proneness of radar QPE to a multitude of errors. Although radar errors have been widely studied and techniques have been developed to correct most of them, residual errors are still intrinsic in radar QPE. An estimation of uncertainty of radar QPE and an assessment of uncertainty propagation in modelling applications is important to quantify the relative importance of the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall input in the overall modelling uncertainty. A suitable tool for this purpose is the generation of radar rainfall ensembles. An ensemble is the representation of the rainfall field and its uncertainty through a collection of possible alternative rainfall fields, produced according to the observed errors, their spatial characteristics, and their probability distribution. The errors are derived from a comparison between radar QPE and ground point measurements. The novelty of the proposed ensemble generator is that it is based on a geostatistical approach that assures a fast and robust generation of synthetic error fields, based on the time-variant characteristics of errors. The method is developed to meet the requirement of operational applications to large datasets. The method is applied to a case study in Northern England, using the UK Met Office NIMROD radar composites at 1 km resolution and at 1 h accumulation on an area of 180 km by 180 km. The errors are estimated using a network of 199 tipping bucket rain gauges from the Environment Agency. 183 of the rain gauges are used for the error modelling, while 16 are kept apart for validation. The validation is done by comparing the radar rainfall ensemble with the values recorded by the validation rain gauges. The validated ensemble is then tested on a hydrological case study, to show the advantage of probabilistic rainfall for uncertainty propagation. The ensemble spread only partially captures the mismatch between the modelled and the observed flow. The residual uncertainty can be attributed to other sources of uncertainty, in particular to model structural uncertainty, parameter identification uncertainty, uncertainty in other inputs, and uncertainty in the observed flow. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-20 00:14:01","2018-01-20 00:14:01","","391-405","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; United Kingdom; Water quality; rainfall; simulation; radar; water quality; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; numerical model; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; model validation; Probability distributions; Precipitation (meteorology); Errors; ensemble forecasting; Rainfall uncertainties; Gages; raingauge; probability density function; England; Rain gages; Spatio-temporal resolution; Radar measurement; Quantitative precipitation estimation; Radar; Conditional simulations; Error model; Model structural uncertainties; Tipping bucket rain gauge; Variograms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, numerical simulations of a field multi-well pumping-recharge test in a deep confined aquifer are conducted to analyze the responses of groundwater and strata to pumping and recharge. A three-dimensional numerical model is developed in a finite-difference software, which considers the fluid-mechanical interaction using the Biot consolidation theory. The predicted groundwater drawdown and ground settlements are compared to the measured data to confirm the validation of the numerical analysis of the pumping and recharge. Both numerical results and measured data indicate that the effect of recharge on controlling the groundwater drawdown and strata settlements correlates with the injection rate and well arrangements. Since the groundwater drawdown induced by pumping can be controlled by artificial recharge, soil compression can be relieved by reducing the changes of effective stress of the soils. Consequently, strata settlement induced by pumping can be relieved by artificial recharge and ground settlements can be eliminated if an appropriate injection rate and well arrangement are being determined. Moreover, the changes of the pore pressure and seepage force induced by pumping and recharge will also result in significant horizontal deformations in the strata near the recharge wells. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:14:13","2018-01-20 00:14:13","","342-352","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Hydrogeology; seepage; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical method; groundwater resource; Pumps; Recharging (underground waters); Numerical models; Horizontal wells; pumping; drawdown; confined aquifer; pore pressure; Confined aquifers; Well pumps; dewatering; Optical pumping; artificial recharge; Artificial recharge; Three-dimensional numerical modeling; effective stress; Biot consolidation theory; fluid mechanics; Fluid mechanics; Fluid-mechanical interaction; Ground settlement; Groundwater drawdown; Horizontal deformation; Numerical analysis; Settlement of structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we examined how the uncertainty due to GCMs propagated through the snow model, which contained nonlinear processes defined by thresholds, as an example of the uncertainty caused by interactions among multiple sources of uncertainty. An assessment based on the climate projections in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 indicated that heavy-snowfall areas in the temperate zone (especially in low-elevation areas) were markedly vulnerable to temperature change, showing a large SWE reduction even under slight changes in winter temperature. The uncertainty analysis demonstrated that the uncertainty associated with snow processes (1) can be accounted for mainly by the interactions between GCM uncertainty (in particular, the differences of projected temperature changes between GCMs) and the nonlinear responses of the snow model and (2) depends on the balance between the magnitude of projected temperature changes and present climates dominated largely by climate zones and elevation. Specifically, when the peaks of the distributions of daily mean temperature projected by GCMs cross the key thresholds set in the model, the GCM uncertainty, even if tiny, can be amplified by the nonlinear propagation through the snow process model. This amplification results in large uncertainty in projections of CC impact on snow processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:14:25","2018-01-20 00:14:25","","196-207","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Snow; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; uncertainty analysis; climate prediction; climate effect; nonlinearity; CMIP; general circulation model; General circulation model; snow water equivalent; Snow water equivalent; snow; Japan; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; temperate environment; Beam plasma interactions; Snow process; Temperature changes; Non-linear response; Nonlinear analysis; Nonlinear propagation; subarctic region; Uncertainty sources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, the two overlapping continua (fractures and matrix) of a dual porosity system are coupled by way of fluid flux exchanges that deeply condition flow at the large scale. This characteristic is a key to realistic flow simulations, especially for multiphase flow as capillary forces and contrasts of fluid mobility compete in the extraction of a fluid from a capacitive matrix then conveyed through the fractures. The exchange rate between fractures and matrix is conditioned by the so-called mean matrix block size which can be viewed as the size of a single matrix block neighboring a single fracture within a mesh of a dual porosity model. We propose a new evaluation of this matrix block size based on the analysis of discrete fracture networks. The fundaments rely upon establishing at the scale of a fractured block the equivalence between the actual fracture network and a Warren and Root network only made of three regularly spaced fracture families parallel to the facets of the fractured block. The resulting matrix block sizes are then compared via geometrical considerations and two-phase flow simulations to the few other available methods. It is shown that the new method is stable in the sense it provides accurate sizes irrespective of the type of fracture network investigated. The method also results in two-phase flow simulations from dual porosity models very close to that from references calculated in finely discretized networks. Finally, calculations of matrix block sizes by this new technique reveal very rapid, which opens the way to cumbersome applications such as preconditioning a dual porosity approach applied to regional fractured reservoirs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:14:41","2018-01-20 00:14:41","","508-523","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","reservoir; porous medium; estimation method; Flow simulation; Fracture; fracture network; Two phase flow; Porosity; Porous materials; two phase flow; multiphase flow; Multiphase flow; Discrete fracture network; Dual porosity model; Enhanced recovery; discrete element method; dual porosity; mobility; Equivalent matrices; Fractured porous media; Fractured reservoir; Geometrical considerations; Homogenized model; Matrix blocks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this guideline is not specific and ignores characteristics of houses that affect their vulnerability. An economically optimal elevation level (OEL) is proposed that minimizes the combined cost of elevation and cumulative insurance premiums over the lifespan of the house. As an illustration, analysis is performed for various coastal houses in Ortley Beach, NJ. Compared with the strategy of raising houses to 1 foot above BFE, the strategy of raising houses to their OELs is much more economical for the homeowners. Elevating to the OELs also significantly reduces government spending on subsidizing low-income homeowners through, for example, a voucher program, to mitigate flood risk. These results suggest that policy makers should consider vulnerability factors in developing risk-reduction strategies. FEMA may recommend OELs to homeowners based on their flood hazards as well as house characteristics or at least providing more information and tools to homeowners to assist them in making more economical decisions. The OEL strategy can also be coupled with a voucher program to make the program more cost-effective. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:14:54","2018-01-20 00:14:54","","63-74","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Floods; vulnerability; Insurance; flood control; Cost effectiveness; Coastal zones; flood; guideline; strategic approach; government; hazard management; homeowner; FEMA; Flood insurance; New Jersey; Affordability; Base flood elevations; Economical decisions; Government spending; Houses; Optimal elevation level; Ortley Beach; Voucher program; Vulnerability factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011–2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year−1. These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively. Only the WTF method indicates a very low recharge of 15.9 mm for the second year. The values in this paper provide reliable insight regarding the use of remotely sensed data to evaluate the rates of alluvial GW recharge in regions where the potential runoff cannot be disregarded from WB equation and must be calculated spatially. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:15:49","2018-01-20 00:15:49","","1-15","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; GIS; Rain; Runoff; Water management; Water resources; groundwater; hydrological cycle; satellite data; Water balance; remote sensing; water management; Sediments; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; Information management; Natural resources management; Remote sensing; Precipitation (meteorology); Brazil; Geographic information systems; estimation method; Soil conservation; Waterresource management; recharge; semiarid region; Gages; Conservation; Actual evapotranspiration; MODIS; Rain gages; satellite imagery; Recharging (underground waters); TRMM; Satellite imagery; alluvial deposit; Natural resources conservation services; Water table fluctuations; TMPA; Ipanema; NRCS; Pernambuco; Pernambuco Basin; SEBAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leaves a challenge for characterisation, modelling, forecasting and management activities. Here we demonstrate the value of community-based (‘citizen science’) observations for modelling and understanding catchment response as a contribution to catchment science. The scheme implemented within the 42 km2 Haltwhistle Burn catchment, a tributary of the River Tyne in northeast England, has harvested and used quantitative and qualitative observations from the public in a novel way to effectively capture spatial and temporal river response. Community-based rainfall, river level and flood observations have been successfully collected and quality-checked, and used to build and run a physically-based, spatially-distributed catchment model, SHETRAN. Model performance using different combinations of observations is tested against traditionally-derived hydrographs. Our results show how the local network of community-based observations alongside traditional sources of hydro-information supports characterisation of catchment response more accurately than using traditional observations alone over both spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that these community-derived datasets are most valuable during local flash flood events, particularly towards peak discharge. This information is often missed or poorly represented by ground-based gauges, or significantly underestimated by rainfall radar, as this study clearly demonstrates. While community-based observations are less valuable during prolonged and widespread floods, or over longer hydrological periods of interest, they can still ground-truth existing traditional sources of catchment data to increase confidence during characterisation and management activities. Involvement of the public in data collection activities also encourages wider community engagement, and provides important information for catchment management. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-20 00:16:02","2018-01-20 00:16:02","","801-817","","","548","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; United Kingdom; catchment; rainfall; Citizen science; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; management practice; spatial distribution; Catchments; flash flood; Hydrological modelling; peak discharge; Monitoring; monitoring system; England; tributary; Characterization; Flash flood; Community-based; local participation; SHETRAN; Tyne River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, two scenarios were considered for Multi-Station (MS) nitrate load modeling of the Little River watershed. In the first scenario, Markovian characteristics of streamflow-nitrate time series were proposed for the MS modeling. For this purpose, feature extraction criterion of Mutual Information (MI) was employed for input selection of artificial intelligence models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN and least square support vector machine). In the second scenario for considering seasonality-based characteristics of the time series, wavelet transform was used to extract multi-scale features of streamflow-nitrate time series of the watershed's sub-basins to model MS nitrate loads. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique which finds homogeneous sub-series clusters was also linked to MI for proper cluster agent choice to be imposed into the models for predicting the nitrate loads of the watershed's sub-basins. The proposed MS method not only considers the prediction of the outlet nitrate but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins nitrate load values. The results indicated that the proposed FFNN model coupled with the SOM-MI improved the performance of MS nitrate predictions compared to the Markovian-based models up to 39%. Overall, accurate selection of dominant inputs which consider seasonality-based characteristics of streamflow-nitrate process could enhance the efficiency of nitrate load predictions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:16:18","2018-01-20 00:16:18","","170-183","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; United States; Water management; Water quality; Wavelet transforms; prediction; streamflow; wavelet analysis; artificial intelligence; water quality; decision support system; data processing; Forecasting; nitrate; Support vector machines; Artificial intelligence; drinking water; Potable water; Data handling; Watersheds; time series; Nitrates; Surface waters; Stream flow; Feature extraction; support vector machine; Conformal mapping; Self organizing maps; Mutual informations; Georgia; Little River [Georgia]; Least square support vector machines; Clustering techniques; Decision management; Input selection; Little river watersheds; Multi-scale features; Wavelet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classic geostatistical approaches based on two-point correlation (i.e., the variogram) cannot describe such particular shapes. In contrast, multiple point geostatistics can describe almost any kind of shape using the empirical probability distribution derived from a training image. However, even with a correct training image the exact positions of the channels are uncertain. State information like groundwater levels can constrain the channel positions using inverse modeling or data assimilation, but the method should be able to handle non-Gaussianity of the parameter distribution. Here the normal score ensemble Kalman filter (NS-EnKF) was chosen as the inverse conditioning algorithm to tackle this issue. Multiple point geostatistics and NS-EnKF have already been tested in synthetic examples, but in this study they are used for the first time in a real-world case study. The test site is an alluvial unconfined aquifer in northeastern Italy with an extension of approximately 3 km2. A satellite training image showing the braid shapes of the nearby river and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) images were used as conditioning data to provide information on channel shape, size, and position. Measured groundwater levels were assimilated with the NS-EnKF to update the spatially distributed groundwater parameters (hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficients). Results from the study show that the inversion based on multiple point geostatistics does not outperform the one with a multiGaussian model and that the information from the ERT images did not improve site characterization. These results were further evaluated with a synthetic study that mimics the experimental site. The synthetic results showed that only for a much larger number of conditioning piezometric heads, multiple point geostatistics and ERT could improve aquifer characterization. This shows that state of the art stochastic methods need to be supported by abundant and high-quality subsurface data. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:16:30","2018-01-20 00:16:30","","208-224","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; groundwater; Models; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; preferential flow; channel morphology; Bandpass filters; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Probability distributions; identification method; Stochastic systems; Digital storage; Kalman filter; geostatistics; variogram; water level; Parameter distributions; subsurface flow; hydraulic conductivity; satellite imagery; Electrical resistivity tomography; Kalman filters; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; unconfined aquifer; permeability; Geostatistical approach; transform; alluvial plain; Aquifer characterization; Multiple-point geostatistics; Site characterization; Tracking (position); Two-point correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most existing methods for estimating ETG using either diurnal or seasonal water table fluctuations are based on the assumptions that groundwater recharge equals 0 in the whole period and ETG equals 0 in a specific duration of time. The aim of the current study is to develop a method to estimate ETG when both assumptions do not apply. In the discharge area of a semi-arid catchment in the Ordos Plateau, NW China, it is found out that the water table fluctuations are influenced greatly by recharge, ETG and the vertical inflow rate (qin) in the seasonal scale but are controlled by atmospheric pressure instead of evapotranspiration in the diurnal scale, which implies that the existing methods are not applicable. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate ETG and qin using the seasonal water table fluctuations based on the assumptions that qin is stable throughout the year and ETG has a linear relationship to the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). It is found out that qin is around 1.12 mm/d, and the ratio of ETG to ET0 is around 0.4. ETG in April through July with the highest ET0 of the year is found to be around 3 mm/d, which is much larger than qin, thus leads to significant decline in water table. ETG in November with the lowest ET0 of the unfrozen period is found to be 1.0 mm/d, which is slightly smaller than qin, thus results in a weak increase in water table. The vertical component of regional groundwater inflow is found to exceed precipitation recharge, indicating that regional groundwater inflow plays the major role on maintaining the shallow water table in the discharge area. Groundwater evapotranspiration is also found to exceed precipitation recharge in most time of the unfrozen period, indicating a specified-flux upper boundary with water loss in the discharge area of an arid catchment. The proposed method could be applied to similar study areas and is critical to understand the budget of groundwater. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:16:43","2018-01-20 00:16:43","","498-507","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; discharge; evapotranspiration; groundwater; Groundwater; seasonal variation; Catchments; Budget control; estimation method; shallow water; Ground water recharge; inflow; water table; Recharging (underground waters); Atmospheric pressure; Water table fluctuations; Ground-water circulation; Ground water inflow; Nei Monggol; atmospheric pressure; Shallow water tables; Ordos Plateau; Regional groundwater; Simultaneous estimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discharge series naturally show a high variation as well as single extraordinary extreme events and, caused by anthropogenic and climatic impacts, non-stationary behaviour. Here, the method of ordinal patterns is used to compare pairwise discharge series derived from macro- and mesoscale catchments in Germany.

In this study, the effects of meteorological drought on the agricultural water resource based on the agricultural water resource carrying capacity (AWRCC) in southern China were investigated. The entire study area was divided into three regions based on the distributions of climate and agriculture. The concept of the maximum available water resources for crops was used to calculate AWRCC. Meanwhile, an agricultural drought intensity index (ADI), which was suitable for rice planting areas, was proposed based on the difference between crop water requirements and precipitation. The actual drought area and crop yield in drought years from 1961 to 2010 were analyzed. The results showed that ADI and AWRCC were significantly correlated with the actual drought occurrence area and food yield in the study area, which indicated ADI and AWRCC could be used in drought-related studies. The effects of seasonal droughts on AWRCC strongly depended on both the crop growth season and planting structure. The influence of meteorological drought on agricultural water resources was pronounced in regions with abundant water resources, especially in Southwest China, which was the most vulnerable to droughts. In Southwest China, which has dry and wet seasons, reducing the planting area of dry season crops and rice could improve AWRCC during drought years. Likewise, reducing the planting area of double-season rice could improve AWRCC during drought years in regions with a double-season rice cropping system. Our findings highlight the importance of adjusting the proportions of crop planting to improve the utilization efficiency of agricultural water resources and alleviate drought hazards in some humid areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:17:21","2018-01-20 00:17:21","","419-435","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Water resources; drought; dry season; global warming; Meteorological drought; climate change; Drought; water resource; Agriculture; Crops; crop yield; precipitation (climatology); climate effect; rice; index method; Global warming; Agricultural drought; growth rate; Crop water requirements; Agricultural water; carrying capacity; double cropping; Effect; Rice cropping systems; Southern China; Utilization efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The identification, monitoring and management of impacts on GDEs are often a key component of mine approvals, which need to consider and attempt to minimise the risks that negative impacts may arise. Here we examine a case study where approval for a large mining project in Australia (Carmichael Coal Mine) was challenged in court on the basis that it may result in more extensive impacts on a GDE (Doongmabulla Springs) of high ecological and cultural significance than predicted by the proponent. We show that throughout the environmental assessment and approval process, significant data gaps and scientific uncertainties remained unresolved. Evidence shows that the assumed conceptual hydrogeological model for the springs could be incorrect, and that at least one alternative conceptualisation (that the springs are dependent on a deep fault) is consistent with the available field data. Assumptions made about changes to spring flow as a consequence of mine-induced drawdown also appear problematic, with significant implications for the spring-fed wetlands. Despite the large scale of the project, it appears that critical scientific data required to resolve uncertainties and construct robust models of the springs’ relationship to the groundwater system were lacking at the time of approval, contributing to uncertainty and conflict. For this reason, we recommend changes to the approval process that would require a higher standard of scientific information to be collected and reviewed, particularly in relation to key environmental assets during the environmental impact assessment process in future projects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:17:33","2018-01-20 00:17:33","","674-682","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; groundwater; Uncertainty analysis; Ecology; Environmental management; hydrogeology; Groundwater; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Mining; environmental management; conceptual framework; Water levels; environmental impact assessment; water budget; environmental risk; Hydrogeological models; Water conflict; mining; Centrostegia thurberi; project assessment; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Springs (components); coal mine; Coal mines; Environmental assessment; Environmental impact assessment process; Monitoring and management; Scientific information; Scientific uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Next, the initial condition uncertainty is quantified through data assimilation and coupled with a newly developed probabilistic drought forecasting model using a copula function. The initial condition at each forecast start date are sampled from the data assimilation ensembles for forecast initialization. Finally, seasonal drought forecasting products are generated with the updated initial conditions.

This paper compares the performance of four rainfall interception models—the sparse Gash (1995), Rutter et al.

Ninety-eight case studies measuring interception in tropical dry (25), arid/semi-arid (29), temperate (26), and tropical montane cloud forests (18) were compiled and analyzed. Coefficients derived from raw data or published statistical relationships were used as model input to evaluate multi-storm forest interception at the case study scale. On average empirical data showed that, tropical montane cloud, temperate, arid/semi-arid and tropical dry forests intercepted 14%, 18%, 22% and 26% of total precipitation, respectively. The models performed well in predicting interception, with mean deviations between measured and modeled interception as a function of total precipitation (ME) generally <5.8% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E estimators >0.66. Model fitting precision was dependent on the forest ecosystem. Arid/semi-arid forests exhibited the smallest, while tropical montane cloud forest displayed the largest ME deviations. Improved agreement between measured and modeled data requires modification of in-storm evaporation rate in the Liu; the canopy storage in the sparse Gash model; and the throughfall coefficient in the Rutter and the NvMx models. This research concludes on recommending the wide application of rainfall interception models with some caution as they provide mixed results. The extensive forest interception data source, the fitting and testing of four models, the introduction of a new model, and the availability of coefficient values for all four forest ecosystems are an important source of information and a benchmark for future investigations in this area of hydrology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:18:00","2018-01-20 00:18:00","","458-470","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; evaporation; climate change; Ecology; hydrological modeling; environmental assessment; Climate models; Land use; Ecosystems; watershed; comparative study; Forestry; Precipitation (meteorology); Storms; Digital storage; land use change; forest ecosystem; water budget; Mexico [North America]; precipitation intensity; interception; Tropics; Statistical relationship; throughfall; Rainfall interception; Tropical montane cloud forest; Gash model; Long-term climate variability; Mexico [Mexico (NTN)]; Model assessment; Rutter models; Tropical dry forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, their widespread adoption has been limited by their computational cost. In this view, surrogate modeling is focused on developing and using a computationally inexpensive surrogate of the original model. While having been previously applied to various water-related and environmental modeling problems, no studies have used surrogate models for the analysis of LIDs. The aim of this research thus was to investigate the benefit of surrogate-based modeling in the numerical analysis of LIDs. The kriging technique was used to approximate the deterministic response of the widely used mechanistic model HYDRUS-2D, which was employed to simulate the variably-saturated hydraulic behavior of a contained stormwater filter. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index was used to compare the simulated and measured outflows and as the variable of interest for the construction of the response surface. The validated kriging model was first used to carry out a Global Sensitivity Analysis of the unknown soil hydraulic parameters of the filter layer, revealing that only the shape parameter α and the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks significantly affected the model response. Next, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm was used to estimate their values. The NSE value of 0.85 indicated a good accuracy of estimated parameters. Finally, the calibrated model was validated against an independent set of measured outflows with a NSE value of 0.8, which again corroborated the reliability of the surrogate-based optimized parameters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:18:15","2018-01-20 00:18:15","","263-277","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; algorithm; optimization; sensitivity analysis; Optimization; hydrological modeling; infiltration; Global sensitivity analysis; model validation; Hydrology; surrogate method; Interpolation; kriging; Fuel additives; Low impact development; mathematical analysis; hydraulic conductivity; stormwater; Infiltration; efficiency measurement; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical models; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Hydraulic tools; Soil hydraulic parameters; outflow; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; filter; Urban hydrology; Numerical analysis; LIDs; Surrogate-based modeling; urban system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For validation purposes, the performance of the methods is compared using simulated and actual groundwater data with a few hypothetical conditions.

In this study we assess the possibility to harmonize the inter-sectoral water allocation scheme within a highly altered human-hydrological system under reduction in water availability, triggered by projected climate change applying scenario-based approach. The Tagus River Basin headwaters, with significant disproportion in the water resources allocation between the environmental and socio-economic targets were taken as a perfect example of such system out of balance. We propose three different water allocation strategies for this region, including two conventional schemes and one imposing shift to sustainable water management and environmental restoration of the river. We combine in one integrated modelling framework the eco-hydrological process-based Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM), coupled with the conceptual reservoir and water allocation modules driven by the latest bias-corrected climate projections for the region and investigate possible water allocation scenarios in the region under constrained water availability in the future. Our results show that the socio-economic demands have to be re-considered and lowered under any water allocation strategy, as the climate impacts may significantly reduce water availability in the future. Further, we show that a shift to sustainable water management strategy and river restoration is possible even under reduced water availability. Finally, our results suggest that the adaptation of complex human-hydrological systems to climate change and a shift to a more sustainable water management are likely to be parts of one joint strategy to cope with climate change impacts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:19:14","2018-01-20 00:19:14","","436-447","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Water management; Water resources; reservoir; sustainability; water availability; ecohydrology; climate change; water management; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Resource allocation; Climate models; integrated approach; resource allocation; Watersheds; water flow; Water conservation; Hydrological modelling; climate effect; Sustainable development; Reservoirs (water); Water resources allocations; Reservoir management; headwater; Hydrological system; environmental restoration; Water management strategies; Restoration; error correction; Water transfers; Environmental restoration; Sustainable water management; Tagus Basin; Water allocation module","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to the problem of parameter nonuniqueness and equifinality, which may bring much uncertainty of the simulation result. How to find out the appropriate model structure supported by the available data to simulate the catchment is still a big challenge in the hydrological research. In this paper, we adopt a multi-model framework to identify the dominant hydrological process and appropriate model structure of a karst spring, located in Guilin city, China. For this catchment, the spring discharge is the only available data for the model calibration. This framework starts with a relative complex conceptual model according to the perception of the catchment and then this complex is simplified into several different models by gradually removing the model component. The multi-objective approach is used to compare the performance of these different models and the regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) is used to investigate the parameter identifiability. The results show this karst spring is mainly controlled by two different hydrological processes and one of the processes is threshold-driven which is consistent with the fieldwork investigation. However, the appropriate model structure to simulate the discharge of this spring is much simpler than the actual aquifer structure and hydrological processes understanding from the fieldwork investigation. A simple linear reservoir with two different outlets is enough to simulate this spring discharge. The detail runoff process in the catchment is not needed in the conceptual model to simulate the spring discharge. More complex model should need more other additional data to avoid serious deterioration of model predictions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:19:27","2018-01-20 00:19:27","","75-87","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; catchment; discharge; performance assessment; sensitivity analysis; hydrological modeling; aquifer; Aquifers; multicriteria analysis; calibration; conceptual framework; Catchments; identification method; Landforms; Hydrological process; Reservoirs (water); karst; Parameter identifiability; hydrological regime; Linear reservoirs; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Multi objective; spring (hydrology); Springs (water); Spring discharges; Appropriate models; Guilin; Multi model; Parameter nonuniqueness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives are to 1) identify the interrill erosion regime and limiting process under the study condition, 2) characterize the interactive effects of rainfall intensity and flow depth on sediment transport competency and mode, and 3) develop a lumped interrill erosion model. A loess loam soil with 39% sand and 45% silt was packed to flumes and exposed to simulated rainfall. A complete factorial design with three factors was used, which included rainfall intensity (48, 62, 102, 149, and 170 mm h−1), slope gradient (17.6, 26.8, 36.4, 46.6, and 57.7%), and slope length (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2 m). Rain splash, sediment discharge in runoff, and flow velocity were measured. Results showed that rainfall intensity played a dual role not only in detaching soil materials but also in enhancing sediment transport. Sediment transport was the process limiting interrill erosion rate under the study condition. Two major sediment transport modes were identified: rainfall-driven rolling/creeping and flow-driven rolling/sliding. The relative importance of each mode was largely determined by flow depth. The competence of the flow in transporting sediment decreased downslope as flow depth increased due to increased dissipation of raindrop energy. The optimal mean flow depth for the maximal interrill erosion rates was &lt;0.1 mm, which is much shallower than the widely reported 2 mm. Slope length was negatively related to interrill erosion rate. The negative correlation seemed stronger for heavier rains, indicating the cushioning effects of flow depth. Lumped interrill erosion models, developed from short slopes, are likely to overestimate erosion rates. Given transport as the limiting process, the so called erodibility value, estimated with those models, is indeed sediment transportability under the study condition. The effects of slope length on interrill erosion regimes need to be studied further under a wider range of conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:19:40","2018-01-20 00:19:40","","652-664","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; numerical model; runoff; Erosion; Soils; slope; soil erosion; Flow velocity; precipitation intensity; Negative correlation; erodibility; erosion rate; Simulated rainfall; Interactive effect; energy dissipation; Inter-rill erosions; interrill erosion; raindrop; Cushioning effects; Interrill erosion rate; Sediment discharge; Soil detachment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An inverted water table (IWT) can develop under a stream in response to the desaturation between the stream and underlying aquifer as the system changes from a connected to disconnected status. However, previous studies have suggested that the IWT can only occur at the bottom of a low permeability streambed in which only the vertical flow between the stream and groundwater during disconnection was assumed. In the present study, numerical simulations revealed that the lateral flow induced by capillarity or heterogeneity also plays an essential role on interactions between streams and aquifers. Three pathways were identified for the transition from connection to disconnection in homogenous systems; notably, the lowest point of an IWT can develop not only at the bottom of the streambed but also within the streambed or the aquifer in response to the initial desaturation at, above, or below the interface between the streambed and aquifer (IBSA), respectively. A sensitivity analysis indicated that in wide streams, the lowest point of an IWT only occurs at the bottom of the streambed; however, for a stream half width of 1 m above a 6 m thick sandy loam streambed, the lowest point occurs in the streambed as stream depth is less than 0.5 m. This critical stream depth increases with streambed thickness and decreases with stream width. Thus, in narrow streams the lowest point can also develop in a thick streambed under a shallow stream. In narrow streams, the lowest point also forms in the aquifer if the ratio of the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed to that of the aquifer is greater than the ratio of the streambed thickness to the sum of the stream depth and the streambed thickness; correspondingly, the streambed is thin but relatively permeable and the stream is deep. Furthermore, in heterogeneous streambed systems, two or three pathways can simultaneously occur and various parts of the IWT occur at distinct positions relative to the IBSA. This challenges the commonly held assumption that streambed under a disconnected stream is always fully saturated, and limits the methods which introduce a negative or atmospheric pressure value at the IBSA to calculate seepage rate or assess stream-aquifer connectivity. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:19:53","2018-01-20 00:19:53","","353-367","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Sensitivity analysis; Water resources; sensitivity analysis; Hydrogeology; Rivers; seepage; heterogeneity; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; hydraulic conductivity; water table; Water tables; Recharging (underground waters); Sustainable management; groundwater-surface water interaction; Atmospheric pressure; capillarity; Groundwater system; permeability; sandy loam; atmospheric pressure; Arid and semi-arid areas; Disconnection; Homogenous system; Low permeability; Stream-aquifer interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate a robust quantification of uncertainty in hydrologic predictions, it is necessary to explicitly examine the forward propagation and evolution of parameter uncertainties and their interactions that affect the predictive performance. This paper presents a unified probabilistic framework that merges the strengths of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) and factorial polynomial chaos expansion (FPCE) algorithms to robustly quantify and reduce uncertainties in hydrologic predictions. A Gaussian anamorphosis technique is used to establish a seamless bridge between the data assimilation using the PMCMC and the uncertainty propagation using the FPCE through a straightforward transformation of posterior distributions of model parameters. The unified probabilistic framework is applied to the Xiangxi River watershed of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region in China to demonstrate its validity and applicability. Results reveal that the degree of spatial variability of soil moisture capacity is the most identifiable model parameter with the fastest convergence through the streamflow assimilation process. The potential interaction between the spatial variability in soil moisture conditions and the maximum soil moisture capacity has the most significant effect on the performance of streamflow predictions. In addition, parameter sensitivities and interactions vary in magnitude and direction over time due to temporal and spatial dynamics of hydrologic processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:20:06","2018-01-20 00:20:06","","484-497","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Markov chain; algorithm; soil moisture; streamflow; Uncertainty; data assimilation; Monte Carlo methods; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Data assimilation; Forecasting; Particle filter; watershed; Metadata; uncertainty analysis; Soil moisture; Soils; spatial variation; Chains; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Markov processes; Polynomial chaos expansion; Stream flow; Moisture; factor analysis; Polynomials; Hydrologic prediction; Hubei; filter; Three Gorges Reservoir; Xiangxi River; Signal filtering and prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (As) while exchange with transient storage (α) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in α is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing α with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs.

In this study, the Wei River Basin (WRB), a typical eco-environmentally vulnerable region of the Loess Plateau in China was selected as the study region. A set of precipitation indices was adopted to study the changing patterns of precipitation extremes and the stationarity of extreme precipitation events. Furthermore, the correlations between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)/El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and precipitation extremes were explored using the cross wavelet technique. The results indicate that: (1) extreme precipitation events in the WRB are characterized by a significant decrease of consecutive wet days (CWD) at the 95% confidence level; (2) compared with annual precipitation, daily precipitation extremes are much more sensitive to changing environments, and the assumption of stationarity of extreme precipitation in the WRB is invalid, especially in the upstream, thereby introducing large uncertainty to the design and management of water conservancy engineering; (3) both PDO and ENSO events have a strong influence on precipitation extremes in the WRB.

SST variations have been correlated with terrestrial precipitation via ocean–atmospheric interactions known as climate teleconnections. This study demonstrates how the scale effect could affect the forecasting accuracy with or without the inclusion of those newly discovered unknown teleconnection signals between Adirondack precipitation and SST anomaly in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Unique SST regions of both known and unknown telecommunication signals were extracted from the wavelet analysis and used as input variables in an artificial neural network (ANN) forecasting model. Monthly and seasonal scales were considered with respect to a host of long-term (30-year) nonlinear and nonstationary teleconnection signals detected locally at the study site of Adirondack. Similar intra-annual time-lag effects of SST on precipitation variability are salient at both time scales. Sensitivity analysis of four scenarios reveals that more improvements of the forecasting accuracy of the ANN model can be observed by including both known and unknown teleconnection patterns at both time scales, although such improvements are not salient. Research findings also highlight the importance of choosing the forecasting model at the seasonal scale to predict more accurate peak values and global trends of terrestrial precipitation in response to teleconnection signals. The scale shift from monthly to seasonal may improve results by 17% and 17 mm/day in terms of R squared and root of mean square error values, respectively, if both known and unknown SST regions are considered for forecasting. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:20:53","2018-01-20 00:20:53","","305-321","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Climate change; Oceanography; Sensitivity analysis; United States; artificial neural network; teleconnection; wavelet analysis; climate change; sea surface temperature; Surface properties; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; Neural networks; Artificial neural network models; Precipitation (meteorology); forecasting method; Surface waters; precipitation assessment; Deep neural networks; Mean square error; quantitative analysis; nonlinearity; Atmospheric temperature; Pacific Ocean; Sea surface temperature (SST); Precipitation variability; Precipitation (chemical); scale effect; Wavelet analysis; Submarine geophysics; air-sea interaction; Quantitative precipitation forecasting; Teleconnection patterns; Sea surface temperature anomalies; Wavelet; Telecommunication signals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study investigates the role of bryophytes in such systems on La Réunion Island (Mascarenes). To better understand ecohydrological functioning of the forest, we investigated cloud water interception (CWI) by two locally abundant liverwort species (Bazzania decrescens and Mastigophora diclados) using a novel lysimetric approach. We also evaluated biomass and water storage capacity of our study species, as well as of the entire bryophyte community in our plots, which we extrapolated to the forest community level. Both study species exhibited excellent abilities to intercept and store cloud water, and showed distinct diurnal variation in this ability according to varying climatic conditions. The two liverwort species’ response to climatic conditions differed dramatically from one another, with B. decrescens storing double the mean and maximum litres of water per hectare despite having less than half the abundance of M. diclados. Despite its lower water storage capacity, M. diclados had a greater ability to intercept atmospheric moisture than B. decrescens. The differences in CWI were attributed to differences in plant structure of these two species, which explains their microhabitat requirements in this system. Our two species in this system were estimated to store 34,569 l.ha−1 of water, the equivalent of 3.46 mm of rainfall. The abundance of our study species combined with their atmospheric water interception, storage, and regulated release ability make both species ecologically important in the forest's microhydrological cycle. For the first time these data allow us to better understand the role of these plants in the microhydrological cycle of tropical montane cloud forests and to determine whether the diversity and functioning of these and similar systems will be at risk from predicted cloud layer/coverage lifting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:21:20","2018-01-20 00:21:20","","665-673","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; hydrological cycle; rainfall; ecohydrology; climate change; Forestry; Digital storage; Plants (botany); Moisture; climate conditions; interception; tropical environment; Tropics; biomass; montane forest; Eco-hydrology; abundance; Bazzania; Bazzania decrescens; belowground biomass; bryophyte; bryophytes; cloud forest; cloud water; Cloud water; epiphyte; liverwort; Liverworts; Marchantiophyta; Mascarene Islands; Mascarenes; Mastigophora diclados; microhabitat; Reunion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis focuses on complex terrain of Utah in the western United States for years 1985–2010, and comparisons were made statewide with supplemental analyses specifically for regions with irrigated agriculture. E was calculated using the standardized equation and procedures proposed by the American Society of Civil Engineers from hourly data, and climate inputs from WRF and GridET were debiased relative to the same set of observations. For annual mean values, E from WRF (EW) and E from GridET (EG) both agreed well with E derived from observations (r2 = 0.95, bias &lt; 2 mm). Domain-wide, EW and EG were well correlated spatially (r2 = 0.89), however local differences ΔE=EW-EG were as large as +439 mm year−1 (+26%) in some locations, and ΔE averaged +36 mm year−1. After linearly removing the effects of contrasts in solar radiation and wind speed, which are characteristically less reliable under downscaling in complex terrain, approximately half the residual variance was accounted for by contrasts in temperature and humidity between GridET and WRF. These contrasts stemmed from GridET interpolating using an assumed lapse rate of Γ = 6.5 K km−1, whereas WRF produced a thermodynamically-driven lapse rate closer to 5 K km−1 as observed in mountainous terrain. The primary conclusions are that observed lapse rates in complex terrain differ markedly from the commonly assumed Γ = 6.5 K km−1, these lapse rates can be realistically resolved via dynamical downscaling, and use of constant Γ produces differences in E of order as large as 102 mm year−1. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:21:34","2018-01-20 00:21:34","","406-418","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Bias; Evapotranspiration; Reference evapotranspiration; United States; Utah; climate variation; downscaling; evapotranspiration; hydrology; interpolation; solar radiation; sensitivity analysis; hydrological modeling; Wind; Climate models; Weather forecasting; Agriculture; sampling bias; complex terrain; Landforms; Interpolation; resolution; climate conditions; Hydrologic process; Sensitivity; Climatic variables; Dynamically downscaled; Radiation effects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since these two affecting conditions are time dependent, having unequal influence, identification of the change point in natural flow regime is of utmost important to separate the individual impact of climate change and human activities on streamflow variability. Subsequently, it is important as well for framing adaptation strategies and policies for regional water resources planning and management. In this paper, a comprehensive review of different approaches used by research community to isolate the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow are presented. The important issues pertaining to different approaches, to make rational use of methodology, are discussed so that researcher and policymaker can understand the importance of individual methodology and its use in water resources management.

However, it being hidden and dynamic in nature, its sustainable development and management calls for precise quantification of this precious resource at an appropriate scale. This study demonstrates the efficacy of three GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques, viz., Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Catastrophe and Entropy in evaluating groundwater potential through a case study in hard-rock aquifer systems. Using satellite imagery and relevant field data, eight thematic layers (rainfall, land slope, drainage density, soil, lineament density, geology, proximity to surface water bodies and elevation) of the factors having significant influence on groundwater occurrence were prepared. These thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights based on the conceptual frameworks of AHP, Catastrophe and Entropy techniques and then they were integrated in the GIS environment to generate an integrated raster layer depicting groundwater potential index of the study area. The three groundwater prospect maps thus yielded by these MCDA techniques were verified using a novel approach (concept of ‘Dynamic Groundwater Potential’). The validation results revealed that the groundwater potential predicted by the AHP technique has a pronounced accuracy of 87% compared to the Catastrophe (46% accuracy) and Entropy techniques (51% accuracy). It is concluded that the AHP technique is the most reliable for the assessment of groundwater resources followed by the Entropy method.

Motivated by the declining number of ground-based measurement stations, research efforts have been devoted to the retrieval of these hydraulic properties from spaceborne platforms in the past few decades. However, due to coarse spatial and temporal resolutions, spaceborne missions have several limitations when assessing the water level of terrestrial surface water bodies and determining complex water dynamics. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can fill the gap between spaceborne and ground-based observations, and provide high spatial resolution and dense temporal coverage data, in quick turn-around time, using flexible payload design. This study focused on categorizing and testing sensors, which comply with the weight constraint of small UAVs (around 1.5 kg), capable of measuring the range to water surface. Subtracting the measured range from the vertical position retrieved by the onboard Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, we can determine the water level (orthometric height). Three different ranging payloads, which consisted of a radar, a sonar and an in-house developed camera-based laser distance sensor (CLDS), have been evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, maximum ranging distance and beam divergence. After numerous flights, the relative accuracy of the overall system was estimated. A ranging accuracy better than 0.5% of the range and a maximum ranging distance of 60 m were achieved with the radar. The CLDS showed the lowest beam divergence, which is required to avoid contamination of the signal from interfering surroundings for narrow fields of view.

In combination with further anthropogenic activities, this results in altered thermal regimes in the subsurface and the so-called subsurface urban heat island effect. Successful thermal management of urban groundwater resources requires understanding the relative contributions of the different thermal parameters and boundary conditions that result in the “present thermal state” of individual urban groundwater bodies. To evaluate the “present thermal state” of urban groundwater bodies, good quality data are required to characterize the hydraulic and thermal aquifer parameters. This process also involved adequate monitoring systems which provide consistent subsurface temperature measurements and are the basis for parameterizing numerical heat-transport models. This study is based on previous work already published for two urban groundwater bodies in Basel (CH) and Zaragoza (ES), where comprehensive monitoring networks (hydraulics and temperature) as well as calibrated high-resolution numerical flow- and heat-transport models have been analyzed. The “present thermal state” and how it developed according to the different hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions is compared to a “potential natural state” in order to assess the anthropogenic thermal changes that have already occurred in the urban groundwater bodies we investigated. This comparison allows us to describe the various processes concerning groundwater flow and thermal regimes for the different urban settings. Furthermore, the results facilitate defining goals for specific aquifer regions, including future aquifer use and urbanization, as well as evaluating the thermal use potential for these regions. As one example for a more sustainable thermal use of subsurface water resources, we introduce the thermal management concept of the “relaxation factor”, which is a first approach to overcome the present policy of “first come, first served”. Remediation measures to regenerate overheated urban aquifers are also introduced. The transferability of the applied methods to other urban areas is discussed. It is shown that an appropriate selection of locations for monitoring hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions make it possible to implement representative interpretations of groundwater flow and thermal regimes as well as to set up high-resolution numerical flow- and heat-transport models. Those models are the basis for the sustainable management of thermal resources. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:22:40","2018-01-20 00:22:40","","697-715","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water management; Water resources; urbanization; Spain; Hydrogeology; water management; Groundwater flow; Parameter estimation; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; numerical model; policy making; energy resource; Urban transportation; urban area; groundwater flow; urban planning; boundary condition; Switzerland; monitoring system; groundwater resource; Atmospheric temperature; cooling; Temperature control; Temperature measurement; Numerical models; development strategy; thermal regime; renewable resource; Boundary conditions; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Heat transfer; heat island; Cooling systems; Air conditioning; Aragon; Basel; Basel-Stadt; building; geothermal energy; Geothermal energy; Heated buildings; Shallow geothermal energies; Subsurface temperature measurements; Thermal boundary conditions; Thermal groundwater use; Thermal variables control; Transferable concepts; Urban groundwater managements; Urban Heat Island Effects; Zaragoza","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method is valid for any values of hydraulic conductivity; there are no limitations of the contrast for the method to be valid. The flows in the strata may be either confined or unconfined, and locally perched conditions may exist, but the effect of capillarity is not included. The hydraulic head is determined by applying the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation. The main advantage of the approach is that very complex conditions in stratified aquifer systems, including locally perched conditions and extremely complex flow systems can be treated in a relatively straight forward approach by considering only the vertically integrated flow rates.

Whether post-fire carbon accumulation is able to offset large carbon losses associated with the deep burning at peatland margins is unknown. For this reason, we examined how post-fire hydrological conditions (i.e. water table depth and periodicity, soil tension, and surface moisture content) and depth of burn were associated with moss recolonization at the peatland margins of three sites. We then interpreted these findings using a hydrogeological systems approach, given the importance of groundwater in determining conditions in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in peatlands. Peatland margins dominated by local groundwater flow from adjacent peatland middles were characterized by dynamic hydrological conditions that, when coupled with lowered peatland margin surface elevations due to deep burning, produced two common hydrological states: 1) flooding during wet periods and 2) rapid water table declines during dry periods. These dynamic hydrological states were unfavorable to peatland moss recolonization and bryophytes typical of post-fire recovery in mineral uplands became established. In contrast, at a peatland margin where post-fire hydrological conditions were moderated by larger-scale groundwater flow, flooding and rapid water table declines were infrequent and, subsequently, greater peatland-dwelling moss recolonization was observed. We argue that peatland margins poorly connected to larger-scale groundwater flow are not only prone to deep burning but also lags in post-fire moss recovery. Consequently, an associated reduction in post-fire peat accumulation may occur and negatively affect the net carbon sink status and ecohydrological and biogeochemical function of these peatlands. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:23:07","2018-01-20 00:23:07","","741-753","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; wildfire; ecohydrology; Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; Floods; Groundwater; Canada; groundwater flow; Fires; Hydrological condition; Wildfire; interface; water table; Wetlands; Bryophyta; Peat; peatland; Produced Water; vertical distribution; Hydrogeological settings; moss; Moss; Peatland; bryophyte; bryophytes; Biogeochemical functions; Boreal Shield; Margin; Peatland ecosystems; recolonization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the parameterization of lake and reservoir routines on a global scale is subject to considerable uncertainty due to lack of information on lake hydrographic characteristics and reservoir operating rules. In this study we estimated the effect of lakes and reservoirs on global daily streamflow simulations of a spatially-distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. We applied state-of-the-art global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses for selected catchments to examine the effect of uncertain lake and reservoir parameterization on model performance. Streamflow observations from 390 catchments around the globe and multiple performance measures were used to assess model performance. Results indicate a considerable geographical variability in the lake and reservoir effects on the streamflow simulation. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics improved for 65% and 38% of catchments respectively, with median skill score values of 0.16 and 0.2 while scores deteriorated for 28% and 52% of the catchments, with median values −0.09 and −0.16, respectively. The effect of reservoirs on extreme high flows was substantial and widespread in the global domain, while the effect of lakes was spatially limited to a few catchments. As indicated by global sensitivity analysis, parameter uncertainty substantially affected uncertainty of model performance. Reservoir parameters often contributed to this uncertainty, although the effect varied widely among catchments. The effect of reservoir parameters on model performance diminished with distance downstream of reservoirs in favor of other parameters, notably groundwater-related parameters and channel Manning's roughness coefficient. This study underscores the importance of accounting for lakes and, especially, reservoirs and using appropriate parameterization in large-scale hydrological simulations. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-20 00:23:18","2018-01-20 00:23:18","","552-568","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; catchment; reservoir; simulation; streamflow; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; global change; Groundwater; Global sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; Hydrology; Efficiency; lake water; Lakes; Parameterization; flood forecasting; Global sensitivity; Hydrological simulations; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; roughness; Manning's roughness coefficient; Reservoir operating rules; Petroleum reservoirs; Geographical variability; LISFLOOD; Multiple performance measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This framework simultaneously integrates a set of leader-followers-interactive objectives established by different decision makers during the synergistic optimization. The upper-level model (leader's one) determines the optimal pollutants discharge to satisfy the environmental target. The lower-level model (follower's one) accepts the dispatch requirement from the upper-level one and dominates the optimal water-allocation strategy to maximize economic benefits representing the regional authority. The complicated bi-level model significantly improves upon the conventional programming methods through the mutual influence and restriction between the upper- and lower-level decision processes, particularly when limited water resources are available for multiple completing users. To solve the problem, a bi-level interactive solution algorithm based on satisfactory degree is introduced into the decision-making process for measuring to what extent the constraints are met and the objective reaches its optima. The capabilities of the proposed model are illustrated through a real-world case study of water resources management system in the district of Fengtai located in Beijing, China. Feasible decisions in association with water resources allocation, wastewater emission and pollutants discharge would be sequentially generated for balancing the objectives subject to the given water-related constraints, which can enable Stakeholders to grasp the inherent conflicts and trade-offs between the environmental and economic interests. The performance of the developed bi-level model is enhanced by comparing with single-level models. Moreover, in consideration of the uncertainty in water demand and availability, sensitivity analysis and policy analysis are employed for identifying their impacts on the final decisions and improving the practical applications. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:23:29","2018-01-20 00:23:29","","121-134","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; Sensitivity analysis; Water resources; Water resources management; algorithm; optimization; water availability; Uncertainty; sensitivity analysis; Water demand; Uncertainty analysis; Pollution; Water pollution; water resource; Economic and social effects; policy analysis; decision making; wastewater treatment; uncertainty analysis; water demand; Water resources allocations; Beijing [China]; Regional water resources; Anhui; Bi-level models; Dispensers; Fengtai; Interactive solution algorithm; Mathematical formulation; syneresis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, application of this kind of robust models in groundwater potential mapping is relatively new. This study applied four data mining algorithms including AdaBoost, Bagging, generalized additive model (GAM), and Naive Bayes (NB) models to map groundwater potential. Then, a novel frequency ratio data mining ensemble model (FREM) was introduced and evaluated. For this purpose, eleven groundwater conditioning factors (GCFs), including altitude, slope aspect, slope angle, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), river density, distance from rivers, topographic wetness index (TWI), land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and lithology were mapped. About 281 well locations with high potential were selected. Wells were randomly partitioned into two classes for training the models (70% or 197) and validating them (30% or 84). AdaBoost, Bagging, GAM, and NB algorithms were employed to get groundwater potential maps (GPMs). The GPMs were categorized into potential classes using natural break method of classification scheme. In the next stage, frequency ratio (FR) value was calculated for the output of the four aforementioned models and were summed, and finally a GPM was produced using FREM. For validating the models, area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was calculated. The ROC curve for prediction dataset was 94.8, 93.5, 92.6, 92.0, and 84.4% for FREM, Bagging, AdaBoost, GAM, and NB models, respectively. The results indicated that FREM had the best performance among all the models. The better performance of the FREM model could be related to reduction of over fitting and possible errors. Other models such as AdaBoost, Bagging, GAM, and NB also produced acceptable performance in groundwater modelling. The GPMs produced in the current study may facilitate groundwater exploitation by determining high and very high groundwater potential zones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:23:41","2018-01-20 00:23:41","","471-483","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","GIS; NDVI; Water management; algorithm; groundwater; spatial analysis; Generalized additive model; software; water management; Statistical methods; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Groundwater management; Land use; Information management; Mapping; natural hazard; data mining; Geographic information systems; slope angle; hazard assessment; land use; Data mining; index method; Lithology; Groundwater exploitation; Normalized difference vegetation index; exploitation; Adaptive boosting; Receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC); Spatial modelling; Statistical software; Topographic wetness index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Measurements were conducted with MLs of various lengths (3.5, 12, 20, 30, 40, 50 cm for 2014 and 3.5, 12, 50 cm for 2015), and on the adjacent soil that served as a control (COT) using cloths attached to glass plates in Sede Boqer (Negev Desert, Israel) during the late summer and fall of 2014 and 2015. In addition, periodical temperature and moisture measurements were also conducted on additional lysimeters. Non-significant differences in NRWI characterized MLs 12–50 cm-long, which could have been therefore grouped (termed ML12/50). However, these lysimeters and especially the 3.5 cm-long ML (ML3.5) yielded substantially higher values than that of COT, with the ratio of ML12/50 to COT and the ratio of ML3.5 to COT being up to 2.4 and 5.8, respectively, implying, as was indeed found during periodic measurements, lower nocturnal temperatures and subsequently higher moisture content at 0–0.2 cm at the MLs in comparison to COT. This was also reflected in the amount of recorded mornings with effective (>0.03 mm) NRWI: 34 mornings based on the ML12/50 in comparison to only 4 when based on COT.

Field simulation experiments were conducted on steep hillslopes (26°) under rainfall (60 mm h−1), inflow (6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 L min−1 m−1), and combination of rainfall and inflow to explore the impacts of rainfall on rill formation, and the interaction between rainfall and inflow on soil erosion. Rainfall decreased soil infiltration rate (10%–26%) mainly due to soil crust by raindrop impact. Rainfall strengthened rill formation, which behaved in the increment in rill width (5%–26%), length (4%–22%), and depth (3%–22%), but this increment decreased as inflow rates increased. Additionally, the contribution of rainfall on rill formation was most significant at the initial stage, followed by the final stage and active period of rill development. Rainfall increased rill erosion (8%–80%) and interrill erosion (36%–64%), but it played a dominant role in increasing interrill erosion under relatively high inflow rates. The most sensitive hydrodynamic parameter to soil erosion was shear stress and stream power under inflow and ‘inflow + rainfall’ conditions, respectively. For the lowest inflow rate, the reduction in soil loss by interaction between rainfall and inflow accounted for 20% of total soil loss, indicating a negative interaction. However, such interaction became positive with increasing inflow rates. The contribution rate to rill erosion by the interaction was greater than that of interrill erosion under relatively low inflow rates.

Where groundwater extraction is licenced, regulators often respond to resource depletion by reducing all individual licences by a fixed proportion. This approach can be effective in achieving a reduction in the volume of water extracted, but the approach is not efficient. In water resource management the issue of the equity-efficiency trade-off has been explored in a number of contexts, but not in the context of allocation from a groundwater system. To contribute to this knowledge gap we conduct an empirical case study for Western Australia's most important groundwater system: the Gnangara Groundwater System (GGS). Resource depletion is a serious issue for the GGS, and substantial reductions in groundwater extraction are required to stabilise the system. Using an individual-based farm optimization model we study both the overall impact and the distributional impact of a fixed percentage water allocation cut to horticulture sector licence holders. The model is parameterised using water licence specific data on farm area and water allocation. The modelling shows that much of the impact of water allocation reductions can be mitigated through changing the cropping mix and the irrigation technology used. The modelling also shows that the scope for gains through the aggregation of holdings into larger farms is much greater than the potential losses due to water allocation reductions. The impact of water allocation cuts is also shown to impact large farms more than small farms. For example, the expected loss in net revenue per ha for a 10-ha farm is around three times the expected loss per ha for a 1-ha farm; and the expected loss per ha for a 25-ha farm is around five times the expected loss per ha for a 1-ha farm. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:24:26","2018-01-20 00:24:26","","145-156","","","548","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Water management; Water resources; optimization; water management; Optimization; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Groundwater management; Groundwater resources; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Extraction; resource allocation; Efficiency; resource management; groundwater resource; Groundwater system; Water allocations; resource depletion; Western Australia; aggregation; Natural resources; equity; horticulture; Horticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large-scale spatial coverage and long-term temporal coverage cannot be achieved simultaneously by using only ground-based precipitation stations or space-borne sensors. Given the temporal discontinuity of satellite coverage and limited ground-based observation resources, we propose a method for siting precipitation stations in conjunction with satellite-based rainfall sensors to maximize the total spatial-temporal coverage of weighted demand in a continuous observation period. Considering the special principles of deploying precipitation stations and the requirement for continuous coverage in space and time, a time-continuous maximal covering location problem (TMCLP) model is introduced. The maximal spatial coverage range of a precipitation station is determined based on the minimum density required and the site-specific terrain conditions. The coverage of a satellite sensor is calculated for each time period when it passes overhead. The polygon intersection point set (PIPS) is refined to identify finite candidate sites. By narrowing the continuous search space to a finite dominating set and discretizing the continuous observation period to sequential sub-periods, the siting problem is solved using the TMCLP model and refined PIPS. According to specific monitoring purposes, different weighting schemes can be used to evaluate the coverage priority of each demand object. The Jinsha River Basin is selected as the study region to test the proposed method. Satellite-borne precipitation radar is used to evaluate the satellite coverage.

Historical trends in snowmelt-related streamflow timing (winter-spring center volume date, WSCVD) were computed for minimally disturbed river basins in the conterminous United States. WSCVD was computed by summing daily streamflow for a seasonal window then calculating the day that half of the seasonal volume had flowed past the gage. We used basins where at least 30 percent of annual precipitation was received as snow, and streamflow data were restricted to regionally based winter-spring periods to focus the analyses on snowmelt-related streamflow. Trends over time in WSCVD at gages in the eastern U.S. were relatively homogenous in magnitude and direction and statistically significant; median WSCVD was earlier by 8.2 days (1.1 days/decade) and 8.6 days (1.6 days/decade) for 1940–2014 and 1960–2014 periods respectively. Fewer trends in the West were significant though most trends indicated earlier WSCVD over time. Trends at low-to-mid elevation (<1600 m) basins in the West, predominantly located in the Northwest, had median earlier WSCVD by 6.8 days (1940–2014, 0.9 days/decade) and 3.4 days (1960–2014, 0.6 days/decade). Streamflow timing at high-elevation (⩾1600 m) basins in the West had median earlier WSCVD by 4.0 days (1940–2014, 0.5 days/decade) and 5.2 days (1960–2014, 0.9 days/decade). Trends toward earlier WSCVD in the Northwest were not statistically significant, differing from previous studies that observed many large and (or) significant trends in this region. Much of this difference is likely due to the sensitivity of trend tests to the time period being tested, as well as differences in the streamflow timing metrics used among the studies. Mean February–May air temperature was significantly correlated with WSCVD at 100 percent of the study gages (field significant, p < 0.0001), demonstrating the sensitivity of WSCVD to air temperature across snowmelt dominated basins in the U.S. WSCVD in high elevation basins in the West, however, was related to both air temperature and precipitation yielding earlier snowmelt-related streamflow timing under warmer and drier conditions. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:24:48","2018-01-20 00:24:48","","208-221","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; United States; hydrology; streamflow; water availability; Climate; trend analysis; climate change; Hydrology; river basin; temporal variation; precipitation (climatology); Gages; Stream flow; air temperature; historical record; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Snowmelt; Atmospheric temperature; elevation; Annual precipitation; Water availability; Timing circuits; Historical trends; Trends; Snowmelt-dominated basins; Streamflow timings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is very limited knowledge concerning the evolution of green roof hydrological performance with system age. This study presents a non-invasive technique which allows for repeatable determination of key substrate characteristics over time, and evaluates the impact of observed substrate changes on hydrological performance. The physical properties of 12 green roof substrate cores have been evaluated using non-invasive X-ray microtomography (XMT) imaging. The cores comprised three replicates of two contrasting substrate types at two different ages: unused virgin samples; and 5-year-old samples from existing green roof test beds. Whilst significant structural differences (density, pore and particle sizes, tortuosity) between virgin and aged samples of a crushed brick substrate were observed, these differences did not significantly affect hydrological characteristics (maximum water holding capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity). A contrasting substrate based upon a light expanded clay aggregate experienced increases in the number of fine particles and pores over time, which led to increases in maximum water holding capacity of 7%. In both substrates, the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated from the XMT images was lower in aged compared with virgin samples. Comparisons between physically-derived and XMT-derived substrate hydrological properties showed that similar values and trends in the data were identified, confirming the suitability of the non-invasive XMT technique for monitoring changes in engineered substrates over time. The observed effects of ageing on hydrological performance were modelled as two distinct hydrological processes, retention and detention. Retention performance was determined via a moisture-flux model using physically-derived values of virgin and aged maximum water holding capacity. Increased water holding capacity with age increases the potential for retention performance. However, seasonal variations in retention performance greatly exceed those associated with the observed age-related increases in water holding capacity (+72% vs +7% respectively). Detention performance was determined via an unsaturated-flow finite element model, using van Genuchten parameters and XMT-derived values of saturated hydraulic conductivity. Reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity increases detention performance. For a 1-hour 30-year design storm, the peak runoff was found to be 33% lower for the aged brick-based substrate compared with its virgin counterpart. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:00","2018-01-20 00:25:00","","332-344","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; water management; hydrological modeling; hydrodynamics; Storms; substrate; Substrates; Green roof; roof; Roofs; hydraulic conductivity; greenspace; monitoring system; Particle size; tomography; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; physical property; Finite element method; Tomography; X ray microtomography; Hydrological characteristics; X-ray; Ageing; aging; Brick; Expanded clay aggregates; Hydrological performance; Physical properties; Substrate characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The SWAT model predicted the streamflow at the outlet of the watershed, with monthly and daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.75 and 0.60 during the validation period. In addition to the daily streamflow data, the flow was also observed at 16 monitoring stations during 6 different events. The validated model was then used to simulate flow at the monitoring stations. The effect of watershed delineation on streamflow and events at 16 monitoring station were then examined by SWAT. The delineation of 99 subbasins, with highest efficiency was selected for the purpose of predicting the potential flow contributing areas with the model. Overall, the flow events were overestimated by SWAT. Temporal variations in the potential flow contributing areas during each event were then analyzed. Flow contributing areas during each event was predicted by the model first and the results showed a good agreement with available information. A current precipitation index was used to simulate the continuous change of soil water content during each rainstorm, and the modeling results of the individual events were used to explore the capability of the model to predict the temporal variation of flow contributing areas during each event. The results revealed that the SWAT model over-predicted the areas contributing flow for events with lower rainfall; while for the events with higher rainfall amount the model closely simulated the time-varying contributing area. The results of this study provide some insight into the possible capability of SWAT model to predict the temporal variations in potential contributing area, and therefore provide an important contribution to the modeling of runoff generation in watersheds, a vital aspect in the evaluation and planning of best management practices. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:11","2018-01-20 00:25:11","","375-386","","","547","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; prediction; streamflow; hydrological modeling; water content; Forecasting; runoff; watershed; soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Watershed delineation; Watersheds; Soil and water assessment tool; Canada; model validation; Storms; Efficiency; Hydrological modeling; Soil moisture; soil water; temporal variation; estimation method; flow modeling; Ontario [Canada]; Stream flow; Best management practices; potential flow; Precipitation indices; Monitoring stations; Contributing areas; Potential flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to climate change, the extreme precipitation quantiles represented by IDF curves will be subject to alteration over time. Currently, a common approach is to adopt a single benchmark period for bias correction, which is inadequate in deriving reliable future IDF curves. This study assesses the expected changes between the IDF curves of the current climate and those of a projected future climate and the uncertainties associated with such curves. To provide future IDF curves, daily precipitation data simulated by a 1-km regional climate model were temporally bias corrected by using eight reference periods with a fixed length of 30 years and a moving window of 5 years between the cases for the period 1950–2014. Then the bias-corrected data were further disaggregated into ensemble of 5-min series by using an algorithm which combines the Nonparametric Prediction (NPRED) model and the method of fragments (MoF) framework. The algorithm uses the radar data to resample the disaggregated future rainfall fragments conditioned to the daily rainfall and temperature data. The disaggregated data were then aggregated into different durations based on concentration time. The results suggest that uncertainty in the percentage of change in the projected rainfall compared to the rainfall in the current climate varies significantly depending on which of the eight reference periods are used for the bias correction. Both the maximum projection of rainfall intensity and the maximum change in future projections are affected by using different reference periods for different frequencies and durations. Such an important issue has been largely ignored by the engineering community and this study has shown the importance of including the uncertainty of benchmarking periods in bias-correcting future climate projections. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:23","2018-01-20 00:25:23","","600-612","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Water management; algorithm; rainfall; Uncertainty; climate modeling; regional climate; climate change; Climate models; runoff; uncertainty analysis; Precipitation (meteorology); climate prediction; future prospect; precipitation (climatology); Bias correction; correction; precipitation intensity; climate conditions; baseline conditions; Future projections; Frequency curve; Reference period; statistical concept","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One option for reducing emissions into the atmosphere is to capture and sequester the released carbon dioxide in geological formations. However, potential geological storage first requires a risk assessment of carbon dioxide escaping to overlying layers and back to the atmosphere through leakage pathways in the formation. This, in turn, requires an understanding of fluid flow through the leakage pathways. In this study, the effect of leakage pathways on the flow of a gravity current was investigated, using an analogue system, a Hele-Shaw cell. Fluid was introduced through the top edge of the cell and flowed out through one or more holes in its impermeable base. The height of the accumulated fluid above the base of the cell at various points along its length and the outflow rate of fluid through the holes was measured. This measurement was conducted with varying conditions of the location, number and strength of source as well as the location and number of holes. At steady state, the fluid motion was in accordance with Darcy's law for horizontal flow in a long thin current. In another set of experiments, in which inflow was stopped and the fluid was allowed to drain out of a single open hole, the outflow rate was in accordance with Darcy's law for one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction until the fluid height above the hole fell below a certain limit. This threshold height was found to be 1.3 cm, which was similar in magnitude to the length of the hole. A time series of photographs tracked the flow of colored dye. The photographs demonstrated that at steady state the fluid traveled for some distance beyond the hole before draining through it. This implies that contaminants may be transported in a formation even beyond an outlet before finally draining out through it. The photographs also documented the shape of the interface between the newly introduced dye and the ambient fluid in the cell. These shapes were found to be different in a cell placed horizontally versus one placed on an incline, suggesting that the geometry and flow conditions in a formation affecting the transport of an injected fluid. These findings may be used as a basis for predicting behavior of a fluid injected into a fractured formation in the subsurface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:34","2018-01-20 00:25:34","","489-497","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Risk assessment; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; anthropogenic effect; risk assessment; Fluid dynamics; one-dimensional modeling; experimental design; carbon sequestration; Flow of fluids; Cells; Cytology; porous medium; subsurface flow; Carbon dioxide; photograph; Geology; carbon dioxide; Seepage; Darcy law; leakage; Porous materials; Earth (planet); Transport properties; Geological formation; Photography; Impurities; Darcy's law; Carbon sequestration; Fractured formations; Anthropogenic emissions; emission control; Hele-Shaw cells; Onedimensional flow; Subsurface formations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a temporal downscaling model employing a nonparametric framework (NTD) with k-nearest resampling and a genetic algorithm has been developed to preserve key statistics as well as the diurnal cycle. However, this model's usage can be limited in estimating precipitation for design storms or floods because the key statistics of annual maximum precipitation (AMP), especially for longer hourly durations, present a systematic bias that cannot be preserved due to the discontinuity of multiday consecutive precipitation events in the downscaling procedure. In the current study, we develop an approach to downscale a consecutive daily precipitation at once focusing on the reproduction of AMP totals for different durations instead of day-by-day downscaling. The proposed model has been verified with the precipitation datasets for the 60 stations across South Korea over the period 1979–2005. Additionally, two validation studies were performed with the recent datasets of 2006–2014 and nearest neighbor stations. The verification and the two validation tests conclude that the population-based NTD (PNTD) model proposed in the current study is superior to the existing NTD model in preserving the key statistics of the observed AMP series and suitable for downscaling future climate scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:45","2018-01-20 00:25:45","","498-516","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; downscaling; performance assessment; South Korea; genetic algorithm; climate change; temporal analysis; Climate models; numerical model; Down-scaling; model validation; atmospheric modeling; Genetic algorithms; extreme event; Population statistics; precipitation assessment; Daily precipitations; diurnal variation; Extreme events; annual variation; Precipitation (chemical); Non-parametric model; discontinuity; Annual maxima","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Records of daily precipitation and temperature from 728 stations across China were used to assess changes in the magnitude, frequency and timing of heavy precipitation using the Peak-over-Threshold (POT) with 95th percentile as the threshold. Because of the continuous nature of the magnitude and timing of heavy precipitation, the “change point” method and the modified Mann-Kendall trend test method were used to detect change points (CPs) and slowly-varying changes, respectively. In addition, the segmented regression and Poisson regression methods were used to detect CPs and temporal trends in the frequency of heavy precipitation, respectively, with consideration of the count nature of the data. The results showed that 55% and 36% of the stations had CPs in mean and/or variance of the magnitude and timing, respectively, while the percentage is only 5.8% in the frequency. However, while there is limited evidence of significant trends in the magnitude and timing, strong evidence points to a significant increasing frequency in most regions of China. These changes may be partly explained by changes in summer temperature. Examination of the summer surface temperature records suggests that the areas, where the frequency of heavy precipitation has a significant increase, are also mostly characterized by significant increasing temperature. In addition, trends of the frequency vary between the periods before and after the turn point (TP) of summer temperature trends, especially in northern China where both the summer temperature and the frequency have shifted significantly decreasing trends to significantly increasing trends. A possible interpretation of these findings is that storms tend to be more frequent without significant changes in water vapor content. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:25:57","2018-01-20 00:25:57","","718-731","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Regression analysis; Testing; Trend analysis; Water resources; drought; summer; regression analysis; trend analysis; water resource; resource management; precipitation assessment; precipitation (climatology); flood; Atmospheric temperature; surface temperature; temperature profile; Heavy precipitation; Change-points; Summer temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS (“Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season”) method, which has been shown to provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved models for constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modified models were developed and tested, each of which contains one additional flow variable to represent antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily discharge record. High-resolution (∼daily) data at nine diverse monitoring sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation of six constituents – chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination, 30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random samples per year (20/year), and (C) flow-stratified sampling with 12 regular (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/year). Results reveal that estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy. In terms of model choice, the modified models show general improvement over the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements were achieved for NOx by the long-term flow-anomaly model and for Cl by the ADF (average discounted flow) model and the short-term flow-anomaly model. Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A, and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, confirming the value of routinely collecting stormflow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent concentration and flux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent developments in water quality modeling. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:26:08","2018-01-20 00:26:08","","387-402","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water quality; river discharge; streamflow; water quality; flow pattern; Sediments; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; Water quality modeling; Storms; Nutrients; River water quality; phosphorus; Phosphorus; antecedent conditions; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; Soluble reactive phosphorus; chloride; Discharge conditions; Estimation performance; Flow anomalies; Flux estimation; nitrate (ester); nitrite; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fully-integrated surface-subsurface modelling has shown potential in increasing process understanding for runoff generation, but high data requirements and difficulties in model calibration are typically assumed to preclude their use in catchment-scale studies. We used a fully integrated surface-subsurface hydrological simulator to enhance groundwater-related process understanding in a headwater catchment with a rich background in empirical data. To set up the model we used minimal data that could be reasonably expected to exist for any experimental catchment. A novel aspect of our approach was in using simplified model parameterisation and including parameters from all model domains (surface, subsurface, evapotranspiration) in automated model calibration. Calibration aimed not only to improve model fit, but also to test the information content of the observations (streamflow, remotely sensed evapotranspiration, median groundwater level) used in calibration objective functions. We identified sensitive parameters in all model domains (subsurface, surface, evapotranspiration), demonstrating that model calibration should be inclusive of parameters from these different model domains. Incorporating groundwater data in calibration objectives improved the model fit for groundwater levels, but simulations did not reproduce well the remotely sensed evapotranspiration time series even after calibration. Spatially explicit model output improved our understanding of how groundwater functions in maintaining streamflow generation primarily via saturation excess overland flow. Steady groundwater inputs created saturated conditions in the valley bottom riparian peatlands, leading to overland flow even during dry periods. Groundwater on the hillslopes was more dynamic in its response to rainfall, acting to expand the saturated area extent and thereby promoting saturation excess overland flow during rainstorms. Our work shows the potential of using integrated surface-subsurface modelling alongside with rigorous model calibration to better understand and visualise the role of groundwater in runoff generation even with limited datasets. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:26:19","2018-01-20 00:26:19","","664-677","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; evapotranspiration; streamflow; hydrological modeling; parameterization; Model calibration; Groundwater; integrated approach; runoff; Integrated modelling; calibration; hydrodynamics; Remote sensing; model validation; Catchments; Storms; Spatially explicit modeling; water level; Stream flow; simulator; headwater; Streamflow generations; Experimental catchments; Remotely sensed evapotranspirations; Process understanding; overland flow; Catchment modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A set of 176 catchments from the MOPEX (Model Parameter Estimation Experiment) project was used for our analysis. Runoff models for each catchment were derived by genetic programming (hereafter GP models). A comparison of efficiency was made between GP models and three conceptual models (SAC-SMA, BTOPMC, GR4J). The efficiency of the GP models was in general comparable with that of the SAC-SMA and BTOPMC models but slightly lower (up to 10% for calibration and 15% in validation) than for the GR4J model. The relationship between the efficiency of the GP models and catchment descriptors (CDs) was investigated. From 13 available CDs the aridity index and mean catchment elevation explained most of the variation in the efficiency of the GP models. The runoff for each catchment was then estimated considering GP models from single or multiple physically similar catchments (donors). Better results were obtained with multiple donor catchments. Increasing the number of CDs used for quantification of physical similarity improves the efficiency of the GP models in runoff simulation.

The IWRM-LXQ was calibrated using existing data from a low flood year (2010) and high flood year (2011), including dry season and wet season flows. The model performed well in simulating low flood and high flood events in both dry and wet seasons where good spatial and temporal data exists. However, our study shows that there are data quality issues and key data gaps that need to be addressed before the model can be further refined, validated and then used for decision making.

It includes fracture pipe networks and matrix pipe networks. They are constructed separately based on equivalent flow models in a representative area or volume by taking the advantage of the orthogonality of the mesh partition. Numerical examples of fluid flow in 2-D and 3-D domain including porous media and fractured porous media are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed unified pipe network method.

Such partitioning is important to accurately assess groundwater resources, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The main objective of this study was to partition (evaluate separately) the evaporation and transpiration components of evapotranspiration, originated either from saturated or unsaturated zone, and estimate their contributions in a semi-arid area characterized by relatively shallow groundwater Table (0–10 m deep). Evapotranspiration, tree transpiration and subsurface evaporation were estimated with EC tower, using sap flow methods and HYDRUS1D model, respectively. To set up the HYDRUS1D model, soil material properties, soil moisture, soil temperature, soil matric potential and water table depth were measured in the area. The tree transpiration was sourced into groundwater and unsaturated zone components (∼0.017 mm d−1 for both) and accounted for only ∼6% of the evapotranspiration measured by the EC tower (∼0.565 mm d−1), due to the low canopy coverage in the study area (7%). The subsurface evaporation fluxes were also sourced into groundwater and unsaturated zone components using the SOURCE package, and their relative relevance in total evapotranspiration was assessed. Subsurface evaporation was the main flux year-round (∼0.526 mm d−1). During late autumn, winter and early spring time, the unsaturated zone evaporation was dominant, while in dry summer the relevance of groundwater evaporation increased, reaching one third of evapotranspiration, although errors in the water balance closure point still at its possible underestimation. The results show that, in arid and semi-arid areas with sparse vegetation, the often neglected groundwater evaporation is a relevant contribution to evapotranspiration, and that water vapor flow should be taken into account in the calculation of extinction depth. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-20 00:27:04","2018-01-20 00:27:04","","54-66","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; evaporation; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Forestry; groundwater flow; Soil moisture; Soils; vadose zone; water budget; semiarid region; water table; groundwater resource; woodland; eddy covariance; Arid regions; Transpiration; Evaporation; transpiration; Semi arid; partitioning; Partitioning; Shallow groundwater tables; matric potential; Arid and semi-arid areas; Soil matric potential; Sourcing; Water table depths; Water vapor flows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper provides a hydrogeochemical characterization of the groundwater in the Milan metropolitan area, one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. First, a conceptual model of the study area based on the analysis of the spatial distribution of natural chemical species and indicator contaminants is presented. The hydrochemical facies of the study area depend on the lithology of catchments drained by the main contributing rivers and on the aquifer settings. The anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality of superficial aquifers is studied by means of probability plots, concentration versus depth plots and spatial-temporal plots for nitrate, sulfate and chloride. These allow differentiation of contaminated superficial aquifers from deep confined aquifers with baseline water quality. Natural Background Levels (NBL) of selected species (Cl, Na, NH4, SO4, NO3, As, Fe, Mn and Zn) are estimated by means of the pre-selection (PS) and the component separation (CS) statistical approaches. The NBLs depend on hydrogeological settings of the study area; sodium, chloride, sulfate and zinc NBL values never exceed the environmental water quality standards. NBL values of ammonium, iron, arsenic and manganese exceed the environmental water quality standards in the anaerobic portion of the aquifers. On the basis of observations, a set of criteria and precautions are suggested for adoption with both PS and CS methods in the aquifer characterization of highly urbanized areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:27:24","2018-01-20 00:27:24","","455-473","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Water quality; catchment; Hydrogeology; water quality; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; anthropogenic effect; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Catchments; urban area; water level; Chemical analysis; Urban areas; water chemistry; aquifer characterization; Hydrochemistry; Lithology; Lombardy; Manganese; Chlorine compounds; Characterization; baseline conditions; separation; confined aquifer; Sodium; Indicators (chemical); Component separation; Hydrogeochemical modelling; Milan; Milano [Lombardy]; Natural background levels; Pre-selection; Sodium sulfate; Zinc; Zinc chloride","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The efficient and optimal decision-making on loading reduction is generally based on water quality modeling and the quantitative identification of nutrient sources at the watershed scale. The modeling process is influenced inevitably by inherent uncertainties, especially by uncertain parameters due to equifinality. Therefore, the emerging question is: if there is parameter uncertainty, how to ensure the robustness of the optimal decisions? Based on simulation-optimization models, an integrated approach of pattern identification and analysis of robustness was proposed in this study that focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty in water quality modeling. Here the pattern represents the discernable regularity of solutions for load reduction under multiple parameter sets. Pattern identification is achieved by using a hybrid clustering analysis (i.e., Ward-Hierarchical and K-means), which was flexible and efficient in analyzing Lake Bali near the Yangtze River in China. The results demonstrated that urban domestic nutrient load is the most potential source that should be reduced, and there are two patterns for Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction and three patterns for Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction. The patterns indicated different total reduction of nutrient loads, which reflect diverse decision preferences. The robust solution was identified by the highest accomplishment with the water quality at monitoring stations that were improved uniformly with this solution. We conducted a process analysis of robust decision-making that was based on pattern identification and uncertainty, which provides effective support for decision-making with preference under uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:27:35","2018-01-20 00:27:35","","708-717","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Decision making; Water quality; cluster analysis; optimization; water quality; Uncertainty analysis; Optimization; Parameter estimation; integrated approach; watershed; decision making; Watersheds; nitrogen; Reduction; uncertainty analysis; identification method; Lakes; pollutant removal; Quality control; nutrient dynamics; Nutrients; Robustness (control systems); River pollution; phosphorus; Eutrophication; Yangtze River; lacustrine environment; Parameter uncertainty; eutrophication; Indonesia; Bali; Decision preference; Hybrid clustering; Lesser Sunda Islands; Optimal decision making; Pattern identification; Quantitative identification; Regularity of solutions; Simulation-optimization models; Sunda Isles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantification of these uncertainties is a key element to yield confidence in the analyses and to provide water managers with valuable information. This work specifically evaluates the influence of hydrological modeling calibration metrics on future water resources projections, on thirty-seven watersheds in the Province of Québec, Canada. Twelve lumped hydrologic models, representing a wide range of operational options, are calibrated with three common objective functions derived from the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The hydrologic models are forced with climate simulations corresponding to two RCP, twenty-nine GCM from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) and two post-treatment techniques, leading to future projections in the 2041–2070 period. Results show that the diagnosis of the impacts of climate change on water resources are quite affected by the hydrologic models selection and calibration metrics. Indeed, for the four selected hydrological indicators, dedicated to water management, parameters from the three objective functions can provide different interpretations in terms of absolute and relative changes, as well as projected changes direction and climatic ensemble consensus. The GR4J model and a multimodel approach offer the best modeling options, based on calibration performance and robustness. Overall, these results illustrate the need to provide water managers with detailed information on relative changes analysis, but also absolute change values, especially for hydrological indicators acting as security policy thresholds. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:27:47","2018-01-20 00:27:47","","280-295","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Climate change; Water management; Water resources; climate change; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; water resource; watershed; calibration; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; uncertainty analysis; data interpretation; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Climate change impact; Hydrological indicators; Objective functions; climate effect; CMIP; general circulation model; Hydrological model calibrations; Managers; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; detection method; Future projections; Diagnosis; Multimodel approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dispersion coefficient and flow velocity are considered spatially and temporally dependent. The spatial dependence of the velocity is linear, non-homogeneous and that of dispersion coefficient is square of that of velocity, while the temporal dependence is considered linear, exponentially and asymptotically decelerating and accelerating. Our proposed analytical solutions are derived for three different situations depending on variations of dispersion coefficient and velocity, respectively which can represent real physical processes occurring in groundwater and riverine systems. First case refers to steady solute transport situation in steady flow in which dispersion coefficient and velocity are only spatially dependent. The second case represents transient solute transport in steady flow in which dispersion coefficient is spatially and temporally dependent while the velocity is spatially dependent. Finally, the third case indicates transient solute transport in unsteady flow in which both dispersion coefficient and velocity are spatially and temporally dependent. The present paper demonstrates the concentration distribution behavior from a point source in realistically occurring flow domains of hydrological systems including groundwater and riverine water in which the dispersivity of pollutant's mass is affected by heterogeneity of the medium as well as by other factors like velocity fluctuations, while velocity is influenced by water table slope and recharge rate. Such capabilities give the proposed method's superiority about application of various hydrological problems to be solved over other previously existing analytical solutions. Especially, to author's knowledge, any other solution doesn't exist for both spatially and temporally variations of dispersion coefficient and velocity. In this study, the existing analytical solutions from previous widely known studies are used for comparison as validation tools to verify the proposed analytical solution as well as the numerical code of the Two-Dimensional Subsurface Flow, Fate and Transport of Microbes and Chemicals (2DFATMIC) code and the developed 1D finite difference code (FDM).

However, it remains challenging to achieve the balance without the consideration of human water use (e.g., irrigation and inter-basin water diversion) for the estimation of other water budget terms such as the evapotranspiration. In this study, the terrestrial water budget closure is tested over the Yellow River Basin (YRB) and Changjiang River Basin (CJB, also called Yangtze River Basin) of China. First, the evapotranspiration is reconstructed using the GLDAS-1 land surface models, the high quality observation-based precipitation, naturalized streamflow, and the irrigation water (hereafter, ETrecon). The ETrecon, evaluated using the mean annual water-balance equation, is of good quality with the absolute relative errors less than 1.9%. The total basin discharge (Rtotal) is calculated as the residual of the water budget among the observation-based precipitation, ETrecon, and the GRACE-TWSC. The difference between Rtotal and the observed total basin discharge is used to evaluate the budget closure, with the consideration of inter-basin water diversion. After the ET reconstruction, the mean absolute imbalance value reduced from 3.31 cm/year to 1.69 cm/year and from 15.40 cm/year to 1.96 cm/year over the YRB and CJB, respectively. The estimation-to-observation ratios of total basin discharge improved from 180.8% to 86.8% over the YRB, and from 67.0% to 101.1% over the CJB. The yearly timescale is the finest temporal scale for the analysis in this study due to the data limitation of naturalized streamflow, irrigation water, and water diversion.

Previous research has argued that aquifer depletion in these regions will impact farmers negatively by reducing the available stock of groundwater to buffer production in future periods, and also by increasing the costs of groundwater extraction. However, existing studies have not considered how depletion may impact the productivity of groundwater stocks in conjunctive use systems through reductions in well yields. In this work, we develop a hydro-economic modeling framework to quantify the effects of changes in well yields on the buffer value of groundwater, and apply this model to an illustrative case study of tomato production in California's Central Valley. Our findings demonstrate that farmers with low well yields are forced to forgo significant production and profits because instantaneous groundwater supply is insufficient to buffer surface water shortfalls in drought years. Negative economic impacts of low well yields are an increasing function of surface water variability, and are also greatest for farmers operating less efficient irrigation systems. These results indicate that impacts of well yield reductions on the productivity of groundwater are an important economic impact of aquifer depletion, and that failure to consider this feedback may lead to significant errors in estimates of the value of groundwater management in conjunctive use systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:28:20","2018-01-20 00:28:20","","638-649","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water management; drought; surface water; irrigation; Drought; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Agriculture; Economic and social effects; economic impact; Water supply; stock assessment; crop yield; Irrigation; Surface waters; future prospect; economic analysis; California; Productivity; Groundwater extraction; groundwater abstraction; Lycopersicon esculentum; well water; Groundwater depletion; Central Valley [California]; dicotyledon; Buffer value; Conjunctive use; Groundwater supply; Increasing functions; Value of groundwaters; Well yield","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The calculations employ some results from Huang et al. (2012, J. Hydrol.), who expressed the SDR as a quintuple integral, but by computing four of the integrals analytically, the present solution requires less computational effort. Analytical calculation shows that the SDR in steady state does not depend on the streambed properties (or any other parameters): Given enough time, the flow through the streambed will equal the pumping rate of the well. Values of SDR are supported by comparing to previous solutions for special cases corresponding to appropriate limiting values of the parameters. Effects of the eight dimensionless parameters are studied systematically: The properties of the streambed, anisotropy of the aquifer, and the position of the well affect the SDR more strongly than the orientation, length, and depth of the laterals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:28:44","2018-01-20 00:28:44","","732-741","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; analytical method; Surface waters; stream; drainage; river bank; Water filtration; groundwater-surface water interaction; unconfined aquifer; stream bed; pumping; Ground water-surface water interactions; Anisotropy; well technology; filtration; Riverbank filtration; penetration test; Gravity drainage; Radial collector wells; Stream depletion rates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method correctly evaluated the slope of the saturation water vapour pressure vs temperature relationship between surface temperature and air temperature. Using daily meterological data spanning several decades from four selected locations in Australia, South Africa and USA, differences in ETo estimates were noted with and without the iteration method applied. The largest difference, which occurred under high water vapour pressure deficit conditions, ranged from 1.65 mm/day for Griffith, Australia to 0.51 mm/day for Pretoria, South Africa. The aerodynamic component of the ETo equation was more affected by not applying the spreadsheet iterative procedure compared to the radiative component. Other spreadsheet examples of the iterative method employed included obtaining the roots of a depressed cubic polynomial in the air temperature surface renewal (SR) ramp. This value was used for the measurement of sensible heat flux using surface renewal. An iterative method, together with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and surface-layer scintillometer (SLS) measurements in a mesic grassland, was also used to calculate the sensible heat flux. The simple iterative method is quick, accurate and convenient, easy to repeat following changes to equations or data, allows easy manipulation and allows convenient visual inspection of data and graphics.

In wintertime, the so-called East Asian Monsoon dominates, largely affecting the climate and meteorology of this region. Being located in the subtropical region, Taipei provides an ideal opportunity for studying interactions between high latitude cold and dry continental air masses and low to mid-latitude warm and wet oceanic air. Indeed, the dual isotope function, d-excess shows the presence of two distinct moisture sources, contributing to the winter vapor isotope variability. Undoubtedly, the dominant moisture source is the high latitude continental cold air masses reaching Taipei with d-excess values of >20‰. Alongside, wet and warm air masses characterized by strong air-sea interaction from the surrounding oceans, possessing d-excess value of ∼10‰ also play a role. The interactions of these two distinct air masses cause the d-excess values to change by as much as ∼20‰ in a few days. Multiple regression analysis shows that source moisture composition and water vapor mixing ratio combined control over 60% of the observed variability. We developed a box model to show that both high and low d-excess events in the winter are primarily controlled by the humidity deficit over the ocean.

Real beaches exhibit local variability with respect to stratigraphy, sediment grain size and associated topographic profile, so that groundwater flow may diverge significantly from idealized models. We used a combination of hydrogeologic field methods and a variable-density, saturated-unsaturated, transient groundwater flow model to investigate SGD and solute transport under Cabretta Beach, a small transgressive barrier island seaward of Sapelo Island, Georgia. We found that the inclusion of real beach heterogeneity drove important deviations from predictions based on theoretical beaches. Cabretta Beach sustained a stronger upper saline plume than predicted due to the presence of a buried silty mud layer beneath the surface. Infiltration of seawater was greater for neap tides than for spring tides due to variations in beach slope. The strength of the upper saline plume was greatest during spring tides, contrary to recent model predictions. The position and width of the upper saline plume was highly dynamic through the lunar cycle. Our results suggest that field measurements of salinity gradients may be useful for estimating rates of tidally and density driven recirculation through the beach. Finally, our results indicate that several important biogeochemical cycles recently studied at Cabretta Beach were heavily influenced by groundwater flow and associated solute transport. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:29:30","2018-01-20 00:29:30","","97-110","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; discharge; Hydrogeology; Groundwater flow; hydrogeology; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; numerical model; field method; salinity; groundwater flow; Biogeochemistry; river plume; biogeochemical cycle; estuarine front; Groundwater dynamics; Stratigraphy; Biogeochemical cycle; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Tides; Numerical models; solute transport; Solute transport; Georgia; Submarine groundwater discharge; underwater environment; Beaches; beach; seawater; lunar cycle; Hydrogeological conditions; barrier island; Sapelo Island; Sea Islands; Topographic profiles; transgression; Transient groundwater flow; Upper saline plume; Variable density","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Future evolution of urban inundation is still an unsolved issue, given large uncertainties in future environmental conditions within urbanized areas. Developing model techniques and urban inundation projections are essential for inundation management. In this paper, we proposed a 2D hydrodynamic inundation model by coupling SWMM and LISFLOOD-FP models, and revealed how future urban inundation would evolve for different storms, sea level rise and subsidence scenarios based on the developed model. The Shiqiao Creek District (SCD) in Dongguan City was used as the case study. The model ability was validated against the June 13th, 2008 inundation event, which occurred in SCD, and proved capable of simulating dynamic urban inundation. Scenario analyses revealed a high degree of consistency in the inundation patterns among different storms, with larger magnitudes corresponding to greater return periods. Inundations across SCD generally vary as a function of storm intensity, but for lowlands or regions without drainage facilities inundations tend to aggravate over time. In riverfronts, inundations would exacerbate with sea level rise or subsidence; however, the inland inundations are seemingly insensitive to both factors. For the combined scenario of 100-yr storm, 0.5 m subsidence and 0.7 m sea level rise, the riverside inundations would occur much in advance, whilst catastrophic inundations sweep across SCD. Furthermore, the optimal low-impact development found for this case study includes 0.2 km2 of permeable pavements, 0.1 km2 of rain barrels and 0.7 km2 of green roofs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:29:41","2018-01-20 00:29:41","","428-442","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; hydrological modeling; Floods; two-dimensional modeling; scenario analysis; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamic model; Hydrodynamics; model validation; SWMM; urban area; flood control; Sea level; sea level change; Storms; Scenario analysis; future prospect; hazard assessment; drainage; environmental conditions; storm surge; Guangdong; Subsidence; Dongguan; Jiangsu; LISFLOOD-FP; Shiqiao; Urban inundation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to accomplish this objective, wavelet analysis is first conducted to investigate the temporal characteristics of groundwater level, precipitation, and stream stage. The results of the analysis show that variations of groundwater level and stream stage are highly correlated over seasonal and annual periods while that between precipitation is less significant. Subsequently, spatial cross-correlation between seasonal variations of groundwater level and riverstage data is analyzed. It is found that the correlation contour map reflects the pattern of sediment distribution of the fan. This finding is further substantiated by the cross-correlation analysis using both noisy and noise-free groundwater and riverstage data of a synthetic aquifer, where aquifer heterogeneity is known exactly. The ability of riverstage tomography is then tested with these synthetic data sets to estimate D distribution. Finally, the riverstage tomography is applied to the alluvial fan. The results of the application reveal that the apex and southeast of the alluvial fan are regions with relatively high D and the D values gradually decrease toward the shoreline of the fan. In addition, D at northern alluvial fan is slightly larger than that at southern. These findings are consistent with the geologic evolution of this alluvial fan. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:29:53","2018-01-20 00:29:53","","650-663","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; river flow; streamflow; wavelet analysis; heterogeneity; sediment transport; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; spatial distribution; Landforms; water level; precipitation (climatology); subsurface flow; hydraulic conductivity; hydraulics; tomography; Taiwan; alluvial fan; Wavelet analysis; Cross correlations; Temporal characteristics; Tomography; Aquifer heterogeneity; Hydraulic tomographies; diffusivity; Sediment distribution; contour map; Cross-correlation analysis; Hydraulic diffusivity; River stages; Zhuoshui River","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bankfull discharge is a key indicator of flood-discharge capacity in the Jingjiang Reach, which can adjust in response to the altered water and sediment conditions and local base-level changes. Therefore, it is important to investigate the variation in reach-scale bankfull discharge, because of longitudinal variability in channel geometry and bankfull discharge in the study reach. In this study, a general method to calculate the section-scale bankfull discharge using the simulated stage-discharge relation is outlined briefly, and an integrated method is then presented for estimating the reach-scale bankfull discharge. The post-flood reach-scale bankfull discharges in the study reach from 2002 to 2015 were calculated, using the proposed method, based on surveyed post-flood profiles at 171 sections and measured hydrological data at three hydrometric sections and eight water gauge sections. The calculated results indicate that: (i) the reach-scale bankfull discharge in the Jingjiang Reach ranged between 32,731 and 38,949 m3/s over this period, with the average bankfull discharge in the Upper Jingjiang Reach being generally greater than the value in the Lower Jingjiang Reach; (ii) the magnitude of the reach-scale bankfull discharge responded well to the cumulative effect of incoming flow and sediment conditions at the inlet boundary, as well as the change of local base level at the outlet boundary; and (iii) the flood-discharge capacity of the reach was controlled by both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions, and the reach-scale bankfull discharge was expressed by an empirical function of the previous five-year average fluvial erosion intensity during flood seasons at Zhicheng, and the difference between the flood-season average water stages at Zhicheng (upstream) and Lianhuatang (downstream), with a relatively high correlation degree between them being obtained.

The fBEs are formulated with two-term distributed fractional orders in time and symmetrical fractional derivatives (SFD) in space applicable to both confined and unconfined aquifers. The SFD in theory consists of the forward fractional derivative (FFD) and the backward fractional derivative (BFD). The FFD represents the forward movement of water along the direction of mainstream flow while the BFD accounts for the backward motion of water in the direction opposite to the mainstream flow. The backward flow at the pore level can be referred to as the micro-scale backwater effect. The analogue of the backwater effect on a micro-scale using the BFD coincides with the wandering processes based on the continuous-time random walk (CTRW) theory which results in the fractional governing equation. With the analytical solutions of the fBE for given initial and boundary conditions of the first type for a finite depth, a set of formulae for groundwater recession has been derived using approximate solutions of the fBE.

Therefore, accurate knowledge of the water resources is of the utmost importance. Due to the declining number of rain gauging stations, the use of satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets in hydrological modelling is steadily rising. However, accurate information on the benefits and deficits of these datasets is often lacking, especially in the West African subcontinent. For validation purposes, these products are commonly compared to freely available rain gauge data, which has in some cases already been used to bias correct the products in the first place. We therefore explored the possibility of a hydrological evaluation, where a model is calibrated for each dataset using streamflow as the observed variable. In this study, ten freely available satellite and reanalysis datasets (CFSR, CHIRPS, CMORPHv1.0 CRT, CMORPHv1.0 RAW, PERSIANN CDR, RFE 2.0, TAMSAT, TMPA 3B42v7, TMPA 3B42 RTv7 and GPCC FDDv1) were thus evaluated for six differently sized and located basins in West Africa. Results show that while performances differ, most datasets manage to somewhat accurately predict the observed streamflow in a given basin. Best results were achieved by datasets which use a multitude of input data, namely infrared and microwave satellite data, as well as observations from rain gauges (usually GPCC) for bias correction. If considering only the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency averaged for all six basins during the calibration phase, best results were achieved by CMORPH CRT and PERSIANN CDR (both 0.66), followed by TAMSAT, CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42 (all three 0.64).

The methods are seasonal differencing, seasonal standardization and spectral analysis to eliminate the periodic effect on time series stationarity. First, six time series including 4 streamflow series and 2 water temperature series are stationarized. The stochastic term for these series obtained with ARIMA is subsequently modeled. For the analysis, 9228 models are introduced. It is observed that seasonal standardization and spectral analysis eliminate the periodic term completely, while seasonal differencing maintains seasonal correlation structures. The obtained results indicate that all three methods present acceptable performance overall. However, model accuracy in monthly streamflow prediction is higher with seasonal differencing than with the other two methods. Another advantage of seasonal differencing over the other methods is that the monthly streamflow is never estimated as negative. Standardization is the best method for predicting monthly water temperature although it is quite similar to seasonal differencing, while spectral analysis performed the weakest in all cases. It is concluded that for each monthly seasonal series, seasonal differencing is the best stationarization method in terms of periodic effect elimination. Moreover, the monthly water temperature is predicted with more accuracy than monthly streamflow.

Thus, these models are not suitable for producing water accounts, which have become increasingly important for water resources planning and management at regional and national scales. A continental scale river system model called Australian Water Resource Assessment River System model (AWRA-R) has been developed and implemented for national water accounting in Australia using a node-link architecture. The model includes major hydrological processes, anthropogenic water utilisation and storage routing that influence the streamflow in both regulated and unregulated river systems. Two key components of the model are an irrigation model to compute water diversion for irrigation use and associated fluxes and stores and a storage-based floodplain inundation model to compute overbank flow from river to floodplain and associated floodplain fluxes and stores. The results in the Murray-Darling Basin shows highly satisfactory performance of the model with median daily Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.64 and median annual bias of less than 1% for the period of calibration (1970–1991) and median daily NSE of 0.69 and median annual bias of 12% for validation period (1992–2014). The results have demonstrated that the performance of the model is less satisfactory when the key processes such as overbank flow, groundwater seepage and irrigation diversion are switched off. The AWRA-R model, which has been operationalised by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for continental scale water accounting, has contributed to improvements in the national water account by substantially reducing accounted different volume (gain/loss). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:30:50","2018-01-20 00:30:50","","124-142","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Water resources; Water resources management; performance assessment; streamflow; water management; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Floods; Climate models; Flood control; Groundwater; water resource; assessment method; model validation; global climate; Banks (bodies of water); river system; Irrigation; water budget; Seepage; River diversion; overbank flow; Murray-Darling Basin; Australian water resources assessments; AWRA; National Water Account; River model; Water accountings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the lack of observed data of inundation maps, sufficient observed data are not available for developing inundation forecasting models. In this paper, the inundation depths, which are simulated and validated by a physically based two-dimensional model (FLO-2D), are used as a database for inundation forecasting. A two-stage inundation forecasting approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to yield 1- to 6-h lead-time inundation maps during typhoons. In the first stage (point forecasting), the proposed approach not only considers the rainfall intensity and inundation depth as model input but also simultaneously considers cumulative rainfall and forecasted inundation depths. In the second stage (spatial expansion), the geographic information of inundation grids and the inundation forecasts of reference points are used to yield inundation maps. The results clearly indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves the forecasting performance and decreases the negative impact of increasing forecast lead time. Moreover, the proposed approach is capable of providing accurate inundation maps for 1- to 6-h lead times. In conclusion, the proposed two-stage forecasting approach is suitable and useful for improving the inundation forecasting during typhoons, especially for long lead times. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:31:01","2018-01-20 00:31:01","","236-252","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; database; performance assessment; hydrological modeling; Floods; two-dimensional modeling; Forecasting; Support vector machines; model validation; forecasting method; support vector machine; precipitation intensity; Hurricanes; Inundation maps; Forecasting modeling; typhoon; Forecasting performance; Cumulative rainfall; Geographic information; Long leads; Spatial expansion; Two dimensional model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Climate warming along with farmland responses has combined consequences for watershed hydrological indicators, which would be expected to exhibit different temporal-spatial patterns. In our study we investigate the combined impacts of increased temperature and shifted farmland on the hydrological features in middle-high latitude agricultural watersheds. The AAT responses in latitudinal and altitudinal directions were revealed by using an agro-climate model under different warming scenarios (△T = 0.1 °C is applied to the interval from 0.7 °C to 1.5 °C). Then, the spatial distributions of dryland shifting to paddy land were determined considering △AAT. For every 1 °C increase in average annual temperature, the boundary for planting paddy fields will shift northward by approximately 160 km and upward in the altitudinal direction by 180 m. Increasing temperature values and the new crop distributions were imported into the SWAT model, which quantified the temporal (monthly and yearly) and spatial changes of runoff and actual evapotranspiration (ET). Annual runoff decreased at a rate of 9.5 mm/°C, and annual ET increased at a rate of 7 mm/°C under climate warming combined with shifted farmlands. Combined impacts increased runoff in February, March and September, and decreased runoff from April to July. ET increased from March to July and decreased in August and September. The comparison of spatial water resource responses indicated that lower altitude and lower latitude areas experienced larger changes in runoff and ET than was the case for higher altitude and higher latitude areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:31:13","2018-01-20 00:31:13","","156-167","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Runoff; Water resources; evapotranspiration; climate change; Climate models; Water pollution; water resource; Agriculture; runoff; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; agrometeorology; Crops; Watersheds; Spatial distribution; climate effect; agricultural land; Farms; paddy field; Diffuse pollution; latitude; Climate warming; Combined impacts; Farmland change; High Latitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rosetta (Schaap et al., 2001, denoted as Rosetta1) is one of many PTFs and is based on artificial neural network (ANN) analysis coupled with the bootstrap re-sampling method which allows the estimation of van Genuchten water retention parameters (van Genuchten, 1980, abbreviated here as VG), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and their uncertainties. In this study, we present an improved set of hierarchical pedotransfer functions (Rosetta3) that unify the water retention and Ks submodels into one. Parameter uncertainty of the fit of the VG curve to the original retention data is used in the ANN calibration procedure to reduce bias of parameters predicted by the new PTF. One thousand bootstrap replicas were used to calibrate the new models compared to 60 or 100 in Rosetta1, thus allowing the uni-variate and bi-variate probability distributions of predicted parameters to be quantified in greater detail. We determined the optimal weights for VG parameters and Ks, the optimal number of hidden nodes in ANN, and the number of bootstrap replicas required for statistically stable estimates. Results show that matric potential-dependent bias was reduced significantly while root mean square error (RMSE) for water content were reduced modestly; RMSE for Ks was increased by 0.9% (H3w) to 3.3% (H5w) in the new models on log scale of Ks compared with the Rosetta1 model. It was found that estimated distributions of parameters were mildly non-Gaussian and could instead be described rather well with heavy-tailed α-stable distributions. On the other hand, arithmetic means had only a small estimation bias for most textures when compared with the mean-like “shift” parameter of the α-stable distributions. Arithmetic means and (co-)variances are therefore still recommended as summary statistics of the estimated distributions. However, it may be necessary to parameterize the distributions in different ways if the new estimates are used in stochastic analyses of vadose zone flow and transport.

This study compares simulation results using TerrSysMP including a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) of a 38 ha managed grassland head-water catchment in the Eifel (Germany), with soil water content (SWC) measurements from a wireless sensor network, actual evapotranspiration recorded by lysimeters and eddy covariance stations and discharge observations. TerrSysMP was discretized with a 10 × 10 m lateral resolution, variable vertical resolution (0.025–0.575 m), and the following parameterization strategies of the subsurface soil hydraulic parameters: (i) completely homogeneous, (ii) homogeneous parameters for different soil horizons, (iii) different parameters for each soil unit and soil horizon and (iv) heterogeneous stochastic realizations. Hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-Van Genuchten parameters in these simulations were sampled from probability density functions, constructed from either (i) soil texture measurements and Rosetta pedotransfer functions (ROS), or (ii) estimated soil hydraulic parameters by 1D inverse modelling using shuffle complex evolution (SCE). The results indicate that the spatial variability of SWC at the scale of a small headwater catchment is dominated by topography and spatially heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameters. The spatial variability of the soil water content thereby increases as a function of heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters. For lower levels of complexity, spatial variability of the SWC was underrepresented in particular for the ROS-simulations. Whereas all model simulations were able to reproduce the seasonal evapotranspiration variability, the poor discharge simulations with high model bias are likely related to short-term ET dynamics and the lack of information about bedrock characteristics and an on-site drainage system in the uncalibrated model. In general, simulation performance was better for the SCE setups. The SCE-simulations had a higher inverse air entry parameter resulting in SWC dynamics in better correspondence with data than the ROS simulations during dry periods. This illustrates that small scale measurements of soil hydraulic parameters cannot be transferred to the larger scale and that interpolated 1D inverse parameter estimates result in an acceptable performance for the catchment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:31:35","2018-01-20 00:31:35","","309-331","","","547","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Germany; Runoff; Vegetation; catchment; discharge; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; wavelet analysis; probability; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; lysimeter; Parameter estimation; Surface measurement; Groundwater; three-dimensional modeling; sensor; Catchments; Stochastic systems; groundwater flow; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; data acquisition; Wireless sensor networks; Complex networks; Soil surveys; hydraulic conductivity; probability density function; Probability density function; grassland; eddy covariance; bedrock; Eifel; Rhineland-Palatinate; headwater; Hydraulic conductivity; Soil water; Headwater catchment; Integrated hydrological modeling; Heterogeneous soils; Wavelet coherences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we apply satellite-based measurements of ground deformation over the Tertiary detritic aquifer of Madrid (TDAM), Central Spain, to infer the spatio-temporal evolution of water levels and estimate groundwater storage variations. Specifically, we use Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) data during the period 1992–2010 and piezometric time series on 19 well sites covering the period 1997–2010 to build groundwater level maps and quantify groundwater storage variations. Our results reveal that groundwater storage loss occurred in two different periods, 1992–1999 and 2005–2010 and was mainly concentrated in a region of ∼200 km2. The presence of more compressible materials in that region combined with a long continuous water extraction can explain this volumetric deficit.

Tests that are generally recommended for such a selection include the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), corrected Akaike's information criterion (AICc), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and likelihood ratio test (LRT). In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation was performed to compare the performances of these four tests, with regard to nonstationary as well as stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. Proper model selection ratios and sample sizes were taken into account to evaluate the performances of all the four tests.

Numerous approaches have been developed to identify optimal sites for predicting mean soil moisture. Each method has certain advantages and disadvantages, but they have rarely been evaluated and compared. In our study, surface (0–20 cm) soil moisture data from January 2013 to March 2016 (a total of 43 sampling days) were collected at 77 sampling sites on a mixed land-use (tea and bamboo) hillslope in the hilly area of Taihu Lake Basin, China. A total of 10 methods (temporal stability (TS) analyses based on 2 indices, K-means clustering based on 6 kinds of inputs and 2 random sampling strategies) were evaluated for determining optimal sampling sites for mean soil moisture estimation. They were TS analyses based on the smallest index of temporal stability (ITS, a combination of the mean relative difference and standard deviation of relative difference (SDRD)) and based on the smallest SDRD, K-means clustering based on soil properties and terrain indices (EFs), repeated soil moisture measurements (Theta), EFs plus one-time soil moisture data (EFsTheta), and the principal components derived from EFs (EFs-PCA), Theta (Theta-PCA), and EFsTheta (EFsTheta-PCA), and global and stratified random sampling strategies. Results showed that the TS based on the smallest ITS was better (RMSE = 0.023 m3 m−3) than that based on the smallest SDRD (RMSE = 0.034 m3 m−3). The K-means clustering based on EFsTheta (-PCA) was better (RMSE &lt;0.020 m3 m−3) than these based on EFs (-PCA) and Theta (-PCA). The sampling design stratified by the land use was more efficient than the global random method. Forty and 60 sampling sites are needed for stratified sampling and global sampling respectively to make their performances comparable to the best K-means method (EFsTheta-PCA). Overall, TS required only one site, but its accuracy was limited. The best K-means method required &lt;8 sites and yielded high accuracy, but extra soil and terrain information is necessary when using this method. The stratified sampling strategy can only be used if no pre-knowledge about soil moisture variation is available.

The results demonstrate that suspended load is the dominant component and there is no consistent suspended to bedload ratio for the catchments. The suspended sediment to bedload ratio appears to be catchment specific. There was no relationship between total load (or bedload/suspended load) and average catchment slope, stream length, shape or any geomorphic descriptor. However catchment total load was found to be significantly related to catchment area. Of the 8 catchments examined here, 6 had been harvested for timber in previous decades (with large areas of forest removed) while 2 catchments had minimal disturbance (Control catchments). There was no difference in sediment loads from the harvested and Control catchments. The results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term. This provides confidence that the forest harvesting and subsequent management do not produce detrimental effects in the medium to long term. An assessment of erosion rates and likely soil production rates suggests that the catchments are eroding soil at the rate it is being produced. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:32:45","2018-01-20 00:32:45","","613-622","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Runoff; Water quality; water quality; Rivers; sediment transport; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; anthropogenic effect; Management practices; assessment method; Catchments; suspended load; Forestry; Harvesting; fluvial deposit; bedload; headwater; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; South-eastern Australia; Bed load; landscape evolution; Landscape evolutions; Human disturbances; forested catchment; Forested catchments; Forest harvesting; physical disturbance; Temporal response; timber harvesting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify the stimuli features of head variations, we propose a systematic approach based on independent component analysis (ICA), frequency analysis, cross-correlation analysis, well-selection strategy, and hourly average head analysis. We also removed the head variations caused by regional stimuli (e.g., rainfall and river stage) from the original head variations of all the wells to better characterize the local stimuli features (e.g., pumping and tide). In the synthetic case study, the derived independent component (IC) features are more consistent with the features of the given recharge and pumping than the features derived from principle component analysis. In a real case study, the ICs associated with regional stimuli highly correlated with field observations, and the effect of regional stimuli on the head variation of all the wells was quantified. In addition, the tide, agricultural, industrial, and spring pumping features were characterized.

To perform an IHS, samples of baseflow (pre-event water) and streamflow are taken at the catchment outlet. For rainfall (event water) either a bulk sample is collected or it is sampled sequentially during the event. For small headwater catchment studies, event water samples are usually taken at only one sampling location in or near the catchment because the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall is assumed to be small. However, few studies have tested this assumption. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and its effects on IHS results using detailed measurements from a small pre-alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland. Rainfall was sampled sequentially at eight locations across the 4.3 km2 Zwäckentobel catchment and stream water was collected in three subcatchments (0.15, 0.23, and 0.70 km2) during ten events. The spatial variability in rainfall amount, average and maximum rainfall intensity and the isotopic composition of rainfall was different for each event. There was no significant relation between the isotopic composition of rainfall and total rainfall amount, rainfall intensity or elevation. For eight of the ten studied events the temporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall was larger than the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition. The isotope hydrograph separation results, using only one rain sampler, varied considerably depending on which rain sampler was used to represent the isotopic composition of event water. The calculated minimum pre-event water contributions differed up to 60%. The differences were particularly large for events with a large spatial variability in the isotopic composition of rainfall and a small difference between the event and pre-event water isotopic composition. Our results demonstrate that even in small catchments the spatial variability in the rainfall isotopic composition can be significant and has to be considered for IHS studies. Using data from only one rain sampler can result in significant errors in the estimated pre-event water contributions to streamflow. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:33:19","2018-01-20 00:33:19","","755-769","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; Uncertainty; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; spatial variation; hydrograph; precipitation (climatology); rainwater; Stream flow; Isotopes; Spatiotemporal variability; isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; baseflow; Spatial variability; Temporal variability; Hydrograph separation; Precipitation (chemical); Runoff generation process; Headwater catchment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of canonical events allow those products to be linked seamlessly and then the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts can be generated using the Schaake Shuffle procedure. We used the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts to drive a distributed hydrological model to obtain ensemble streamflow forecasts and evaluated those forecasts against the observed streamflow. We found that the careful design of canonical events can help extract more useful information, especially when up-to-date observed precipitation is used to setup the canonical events.

Basin runoff response between and among years was driven largely by differences in the timing and magnitude of precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration, hence antecedent moisture conditions, which varied markedly over the four-year study (April–Sept). Runoff coefficients for individual precipitation events ranged from <1 to >90% depending on storm dynamics and antecedent conditions. Owing to its higher elevation, the basin received 55% more precipitation per month on average compared to 30-year climate normals and an average of 86 mm more precipitation per season than the nearby regional weather station. The wetland and adjacent forestlands became coupled during intermittent wet periods which generated substantial runoff. The findings of the current study suggest that, in contrast to conventional conceptual models, headwater catchments within the subhumid WBP have the capacity to generate significant runoff throughout the snow-free period.

The availability of historical annual maximum (AMS) data (1930–1966) in addition to systemic AMS data (1967–2015) enables a unique comparison between the performance of the PDS sample and the systemic AMS sample. A recently derived formula for the translation of the PDS into the annual domain, simplifying the use of the PDS, is utilised in an applied case study for the first time. Overall, the study shows that PDS sampling returns flood magnitudes similar to those produced by AMS series utilising historical data and thus the use of the PDS should be preferred in cases where historical flood data is unavailable. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:34:01","2018-01-20 00:34:01","","365-374","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; New Zealand; probability; Floods; Flood control; Catchments; Probability distributions; sampling; frequency analysis; river channel; Peaks over threshold; threshold; flood frequency; braided river; Frequency domain analysis; Frequency Analysis; partial duration series; Partial duration series; Annual maximum series; Threshold selection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The shapes of the final probability density functions given by the kernel density estimators show varying characteristics.

It also allows an integrated estimate of uncertainties arising from different sources which is an essential diagnostic when datasets from various sources are considered.

However, reverse conditions (groundwater dynamics conditioned by surface water interferences), although less described, may also occur. In this research, the local river-spring connectivity and induced hydrogeochemical interactions in intensely folded, fractured and layered Cretaceous marls and marly-limestones (Fuensanta river valley, S Spain) are discussed based on field observations, tracer tests and hydrodynamic and hydrochemical data. The differential flow measurements and tracing experiments performed in the Fuensanta river permitted us to quantify the surface water losses and to verify its direct hydraulic connection with the Fuensanta spring. The numerical simulations of tracer breakthrough curves suggest the existence of a groundwater flow system through well-connected master and tributary fractures, with fast and multi-source flow components. Furthermore, the multivariate statistical analysis conducted using chemical data from the sampled waters, the geochemical study of water-rock interactions and the proposed water mixing approach allowed the spatial characterization of the chemistry of the springs and river/stream waters draining low permeable Cretaceous formations. Results corroborated that the mixing of surface waters, as well as calcite dissolution and CO2 dissolution/exsolution, are the main geochemical processes constraining Fuensanta spring hydrochemistry. The estimated contribution of the tributary surface waters to the spring flow during the research period was approximately 26–53% (Fuensanta river) and 47–74% (Convento stream), being predominant the first component during high flow and the second one during the dry season. The identification of secondary geochemical processes (dolomite and gypsum dissolution and dedolomitization) in Fuensanta spring waters evidences the induced hydrogeochemical changes resulting from the allogenic recharge. This research highlights the usefulness of an integrated approach based on river and spring flow examination, dye tracing interpretation and regression and multivariate statistical analysis using hydrochemical data for surface water-groundwater interaction assessment in fractured complex environments worldwide, whose implementation becomes critical for an appropriate groundwater policy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:34:46","2018-01-20 00:34:46","","253-268","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; connectivity; Spain; Statistical methods; Rivers; Groundwater flow; Groundwater; integrated approach; Catchments; groundwater flow; Landforms; Multivariant analysis; Surface waters; Fertilizers; Chemical analysis; Carbon dioxide; Mixing; Hydrochemistry; Geochemistry; Groundwater geochemistry; groundwater-surface water interaction; dissolution; Dissolution; Hydrogeochemical process; hydrogeochemistry; Multivariate statistical analysis; Groundwater flow systems; fracture flow; Tracer breakthrough curves; Centrostegia thurberi; Spatial characterization; spring water; Surface water-groundwater interaction; Cretaceous; dye tracer; Electron emission; Fractured-rock formations; River valley; valley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The availability of precipitation data is constantly increasing due to the shift towards more open data sharing. However, the applicability of such data for urban runoff assessments is often unknown. Here, the feasibility of Finnish Meteorological Institute's open rain gauge and open weather radar data as input sources was studied by conducting Storm Water Management Model simulations at a very small (33.5 ha) urban catchment in Helsinki, Finland. In addition to the open data sources, data were also available from two research gauges, one of them located on-site, and from a research radar. The results confirmed the importance of local precipitation measurements for urban rainfall-runoff simulations, implying the suitability of open gauge data to be largely dictated by the gauge's distance from the catchment. Performance of open radar data with 5 min and 1 km2 resolution was acceptable in terms of runoff reproduction, albeit peak flows were constantly and flow volumes often underestimated. Gauge adjustment and advection interpolation were found to improve the quality of the radar data, and at least gauge adjustment should be performed when open radar data are used. Finally, utilizing dual-polarization capabilities of radars has a potential to improve rainfall estimates for high intensity storms although more research is still needed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:35:01","2018-01-20 00:35:01","","143-155","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Water management; catchment; hydrology; rainfall; rainfall-runoff modeling; radar; runoff; data interpretation; Catchments; SWMM; urban area; Precipitation (meteorology); Storms; Hydrology; Rainfall - Runoff modelling; Gages; raingauge; Rain gages; Meteorological radar; Radar; Precipitation measurement; Storm water management model; Rain gauges; Finland; Urban hydrology; Sewage; Rainfall-runoff simulations; Open datum; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such systems are usually associated with strong structural complexity, which is rarely characterised in detail or robustly. This research focuses on a CTMCG hydrosystem associated with a peri-alpine graben. A multidisciplinary approach with a very large set of data and methods – geological modelling with geophysics and geological data from outcrops and several boreholes, hydrodynamic data, hydrochemistry, hydrogeological and geochemical modelling – reveals very novel results and allows a robust conceptual model to be constructed. The aquifer at the origin of the carbo-gaseous natural mineral water is the 100–125 m-thick fractured stratiform layer of the weathering profile of the crystalline rock (granite). It forms a rather large and thick inertial aquifer that can be numerically modelled, in a similar fashion to a porous medium. The majority of tectonic faults length act as impervious boundaries that divide this aquifer into around ten elongated compartments that were precisely delineated. These tectonic faults are permeable only along two small areas that were also precisely located. These permeable zones feed some aquifer compartments with deep, highly mineralised carbo-gaseous water, which mixes with “fresher” water and forms the exploited NMW. These results can be generalised and in particular show a strong opposition between low-inertia CTMCG hydrosystems without a subsurface reservoir, as the weathering profile was eroded, and high-inertia hydrosystems such as the one studied. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:35:17","2018-01-20 00:35:17","","690-707","","","547","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; reservoir; hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; hydrogeology; aquifer; Aquifers; numerical model; Water; Reservoirs (water); water chemistry; Hydrochemistry; Geology; Crystalline rocks; Tectonics; Weathering; Fracture; Porous materials; Minerals; crystalline rock; Faulting; Crystalline materials; Structural geology; weathering profile; Geochemical modelling; granite; Beverages; Deep fractures; Geological modelling; geology; Hydraulic tests; Multi-disciplinary approach; Structural complexity; Subsurface reservoir; tectonic setting; Weathering profiles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) hydrologic data assimilation system that predicts bias in satellite soil moisture data to support the physically based Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) infiltration model, which estimates root zone soil moisture with satellite soil moisture data. The SMAR-EnKF model estimates a regional-scale bias parameter using available in situ data. The regional bias parameter is added to satellite soil moisture retrievals before their use in the SMAR model, and the bias parameter is updated continuously over time with the EnKF algorithm. In this study, the SMAR-EnKF assimilates in situ soil moisture at 43 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) monitoring locations across the conterminous U.S. Multivariate regression models are developed to estimate SMAR parameters using soil physical properties and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration data product as covariates. SMAR-EnKF root zone soil moisture predictions are in relatively close agreement with in situ observations when using optimal model parameters, with root mean square errors averaging 0.051 [cm3 cm−3] (standard error, s.e. = 0.005). The average root mean square error associated with a 20-fold cross-validation analysis with permuted SMAR parameter regression models increases moderately (0.082 [cm3 cm−3], s.e. = 0.004). The expected regional-scale satellite correction bias is negative in four out of six ecoregions studied (mean = −0.12 [-], s.e. = 0.002), excluding the Great Plains and Eastern Temperate Forests (0.053 [-], s.e. = 0.001). With its capability of estimating regional-scale satellite bias, the SMAR-EnKF system can predict root zone soil moisture over broad extents and has applications in drought predictions and other operational hydrologic modeling purposes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:35:32","2018-01-20 00:35:32","","393-404","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Markov chain; Regression analysis; United States; evapotranspiration; satellite data; soil moisture; data assimilation; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Parameter estimation; Climate models; Forecasting; Satellites; infiltration; model validation; Soil moisture; Soils; Errors; Kalman filter; Markov processes; Mean square error; Soil surveys; MODIS; Moisture; rhizosphere; Soil moisture measurement; Radiometers; Image reconstruction; temperate forest; AMSR-E; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite imagery; Cross-validation analysis; Great Plains; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Kalman; Monte Carlo Markov chain; Multivariate regression models; Root; Satellite communication systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little evidence has been gained from direct measurements of overland and infiltration water fluxes between bare soil inter-patches and shrub mounds at a scale compatible with available high resolution imagery and hydrological modeling techniques. The objective of this study is to address the thin scale internal redistribution of water between BS inter-patches and vegetated mounds at relatively flat spotted semiarid landscapes. The relation between plant cover, topography and runoff was inspected with non-parametric association coefficients based on high resolution remotely sensed imagery, ground truth topographic elevation and spatial-explicit field data on potential runoff. Measurements of advective flows at the same spatial scale were carried out at micro-plots of BS and shrub mounds. Water fluxes between BS inter-patch and a shrub mound were simulated under varying typical Patagonian rainfall scenarios with an hydrological model. Results obtained revealed that the soil properties, infiltration and overland flow metrics at the mounds and inter-patches exhibit spatially and dynamic variable hydraulic properties. High micro-topographic roughness and depression storage thickened overland flow depth at VS patches. At BS inter-patches prevailing low slopes and depression storage were found to be important variables attenuating the surface runoff. At both rainfall scenarios simulated, the soil under the shrub mound accumulated more moisture (from direct rain) and reached saturation long before this occurred in BS nearby inter-patch area. Overland flow at the inter-patch was attenuated as it reached the border of the patch, diverging from the latter as it followed the (small) topographic gradient. The overland flow generated inside the vegetated mound was effectively retained at the typical Summer rainfall scenario; while several threads of runoff were routed outside the mound at the typical Winter rainfall scenario. The results here shown fail to detect: (a) enough runoff momentum that could route runon onto the vegetated mounds and (b) a contrast in infiltration rates between BS and the vegetated mound enough to lead to a free-surface gradient in ponded water that could inundate the mound. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:35:47","2018-01-20 00:35:47","","219-229","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; rainfall-runoff modeling; hydrological modeling; vegetation cover; infiltration; Precipitation (meteorology); Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Soils; Digital storage; Plants (botany); microtopography; bare soil; Infiltration; Topographic gradients; overland flow; surface roughness; Micro topography; Association coefficient; High resolution imagery; High-resolution remotely sensed imageries; image resolution; momentum; Topographic roughness; Vegetated mound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We integrate numerical modelling of flood inundation with geographical analysis of service areas for the Ambulance Service and the Fire &amp; Rescue Service. The method was demonstrated for two flood events in the City of York, UK to assess the vulnerability of care homes and sheltered accommodation. We determine the feasibility of emergency services gaining access within the statutory 8- and 10-min targets for high-priority, life-threatening incidents 75% of the time, during flood episodes. A hydrodynamic flood inundation model (FloodMap) simulates the 2014 pluvial and 2015 fluvial flood events. Predicted floods (with depth &gt;25 cm and areas &gt;100 m2) were overlain on the road network to identify sites with potentially restricted access. Accessibility of the city to emergency responders during flooding was quantified and mapped using; (i) spatial coverage from individual emergency nodes within the legislated timeframes, and; (ii) response times from individual emergency service nodes to vulnerable care homes and sheltered accommodation under flood and non-flood conditions. Results show that, during the 2015 fluvial flood, the area covered by two of the three Fire &amp; Rescue Service stations reduced by 14% and 39% respectively, while the remaining station needed to increase its coverage by 39%. This amounts to an overall reduction of 6% and 20% for modelled and observed floods respectively. During the 2014 surface water flood, 7 out of 22 care homes (32%) and 15 out of 43 sheltered accommodation nodes (35%) had modelled response times above the 8-min threshold from any Ambulance station. Overall, modelled surface water flooding has a larger spatial footprint than fluvial flood events. Hence, accessibility of emergency services may be impacted differently depending on flood mechanism. Moreover, we expect emergency services to face greater challenges under a changing climate with a growing, more vulnerable population. The methodology developed in this study could be applied to other cities, as well as for scenario-based evaluation of emergency preparedness to support strategic decision making, and in real-time forecasting to guide operational decisions where heavy rainfall lead-time and spatial resolution are sufficient. © 2017 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-20 00:36:19","2018-01-20 00:36:19","","419-436","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Decision making; Rain; United Kingdom; hydrological modeling; Floods; flooding; Flood control; vulnerability; decision making; hydrodynamics; Transportation; Oil well flooding; Surface waters; real time; flood forecasting; Urban flooding; spatial resolution; England; precipitation intensity; accessibility; Emergency services; Accessibility analysis; Ambulances; Flood modelling; housing provision; Inundation modeling; Vulnerable population; York [England]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models yield grids depicting the probability that groundwater in a particular location will have dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations less than selected threshold values representing anoxic groundwater conditions, or will have dissolved manganese (Mn) concentrations greater than selected threshold values representing secondary drinking water-quality contaminant levels (SMCL) and health-based screening levels (HBSL). The probability models were constrained by the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley to a depth of approximately 300 m. Probability distribution grids can be extracted from the 3-D models at any desired depth, and are of interest to water-resource managers, water-quality researchers, and groundwater modelers concerned with the occurrence of natural and anthropogenic contaminants related to anoxic conditions. Models were constructed using a Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) machine learning technique that produces many trees as part of an additive model and has the ability to handle many variables, automatically incorporate interactions, and is resistant to collinearity. Machine learning methods for statistical prediction are becoming increasing popular in that they do not require assumptions associated with traditional hypothesis testing. Models were constructed using measured dissolved oxygen and manganese concentrations sampled from 2767 wells within the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley, and over 60 explanatory variables representing regional-scale soil properties, soil chemistry, land use, aquifer textures, and aquifer hydrologic properties. Models were trained on a USGS dataset of 932 wells, and evaluated on an independent hold-out dataset of 1835 wells from the California Division of Drinking Water. We used cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of models of varying complexity, as a basis for selecting final models. Trained models were applied to cross-validation testing data and a separate hold-out dataset to evaluate model predictive performance by emphasizing three model metrics of fit: Kappa; accuracy; and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). The final trained models were used for mapping predictions at discrete depths to a depth of 304.8 m. Trained DO and Mn models had accuracies of 86–100%, Kappa values of 0.69–0.99, and ROC values of 0.92–1.0. Model accuracies for cross-validation testing datasets were 82–95% and ROC values were 0.87–0.91, indicating good predictive performance. Kappas for the cross-validation testing dataset were 0.30–0.69, indicating fair to substantial agreement between testing observations and model predictions. Hold-out data were available for the manganese model only and indicated accuracies of 89–97%, ROC values of 0.73–0.75, and Kappa values of 0.06–0.30. The predictive performance of both the DO and Mn models was reasonable, considering all three of these fit metrics and the low percentages of low-DO and high-Mn events in the data. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:36:35","2018-01-20 00:36:35","","341-356","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water quality; Water resources; groundwater; regression analysis; water quality; machine learning; probability; Forecasting; anthropogenic effect; aquifer; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Land use; water resource; Artificial intelligence; drinking water; Potable water; Water; three-dimensional modeling; model validation; Forestry; Probability distributions; resource management; Landforms; anthropogenic source; Cross validation; California; Biochemical oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; Dissolved oxygen; Learning systems; Machine learning techniques; Anthropogenic contaminants; Statistical tests; Manganese; Dissolution; anoxic conditions; Probability; pollutant source; redox conditions; Impurities; Central Valley [California]; Boosted regression trees; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Health-based screening levels; manganese; Manganese removal (water treatment); Receiver operator characteristic curves; Redox condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the deeper layers, soil moisture influences the processes of freeze-thaw, erosion and water cycle. Cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is a new method for continuously monitoring mean soil water content (SWC) at hectometer scale, which has been applied in an alpine meadow at a high accuracy. However, with CRNP measuring depth of only 30 cm, depth-scaling is needed for sufficient insight into deep-layer soil moisture. This study evaluated the accuracy of CRNP measurement of SWC in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and the performance of temporal stability (TS) analysis in depth-scaling CRNP-estimated SWC. During the study period, 11 field samplings were done for calibration of CRNP-estimated SWC. Using 22 occasions of neutron probe measurements for each of 113 investigated locations, the TS of SWC was analyzed and its performance in depth-scaling CRNP-estimated SWC at five soil depths (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm) was evaluated. The results showed that the mean SWCs to the depth of 50 cm were 12.9 and 17.0%, respectively in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons and were temporally influenced by precipitation and spatially by soil depth. The accuracy of the CRNP-measured SWC was high, with root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 2.1% and 0.832, respectively. Representative locations for TS existed in all the soil layers, which increased with increasing soil depth. For the various soil layers, TS-estimated SWC was close to field-measured value. Only a relatively small error and high NSE were noted, suggesting that TS was reliable in application in CRNP depth-scaling. The study provided further scientific basis for the application of CRNP and an effective way of depth-scaling CRNP-estimated mean SWC in alpine meadow ecosystems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:36:52","2018-01-20 00:36:52","","299-308","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; soil moisture; Ecology; temporal analysis; water content; Ecosystems; field method; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; estimation method; Mean square error; Soil water content; Moisture; grass; cosmic ray; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Cosmic ray neutron; Neutrons; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Northern Tibetan plateaux; alpine environment; scale effect; growing season; neutron probe; meadow; Probes; limiting factor; Temporal stability; Depth-scaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, rainfall forecasting, especially the very short-term (hourly) rainfall, is one of the most difficult tasks in hydrology due to the high variability in space and time and the complex physical process. In this study, the purpose is to provide effective forecasts of very short-term rainfall by means of the ensemble numerical weather prediction system in Taiwan. To this end, the ensemble forecasts of hourly rainfall from this ensemble numerical weather prediction system are analyzed to evaluate the performance. Furthermore, a methodology, which is based on the principle of analogue prediction, is proposed to effectively process these ensemble forecasts for improving the performance on very short-term rainfall forecasting. To clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methodology, actual application is conducted on a mountainous watershed to yield 1- to 6-h ahead forecasts during typhoon events. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is better performed and more flexible than the conventional one. Generally, the proposed methodology provides improved performance for very short-term rainfall forecasting, especially for 1- to 2-h ahead forecasting.

In estimating crop irrigation requirements and surface evaporation in Utah, United States of America, methodology and software were developed using the ASCE Standardized Penman-Monteith Reference Evapotranspiration equation with input climate drivers from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) gridded weather forcing dataset and a digital elevation model. A simple procedure was devised to correct bias in NLDAS relative humidity and air temperature data based on comparison to weather data from ground stations. Potential evapotranspiration was calculated for 18 crops (including turfgrass), wetlands (large and narrow), and open water evaporation (deep and shallow) by multiplying crop coefficient curves to reference evapotranspiration with annual curve dates set by summation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration, cumulative growing degree days, or number of days. Net potential evapotranspiration was calculated by subtracting effective precipitation estimates from the Daymet gridded precipitation dataset. Analysis of the results showed that daily estimated potential crop evapotranspiration from the model compared well with estimates from electronic weather stations (1980–2014) and with independently calculated potential crop evapotranspiration in adjacent states.

To serve this purpose, a variety of rainfall products, especially the gauge based products which serve as the ground-truth for other derived rainfall products, are available over India. In this study, three different daily gauge based gridded rainfall datasets, namely Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of water resources (APHRODITE) and Climate Prediction Center (CPC) unified rain gauge data are compared over India for the monsoon season of 1979–2007. The comparison among the datasets is based on the duration, frequency and intensity of three different spell characteristics, namely dry, wet and extreme wet spells, and their associated trends. Wet (dry) spells are defined as the consecutive period of wet (dry) days, where a wet (dry) day is defined using rainfall threshold of 1 mm. Extreme wet spells are defined using the 90th percentile of rainfall above the depth of wet day. All datasets capture the spatial distribution of precipitation characteristics, albeit with pronounced differences at heavy rainfall regions. CPC and IMD show a close match in spell characteristics while APHRODITE significantly deviates. APHRODITE shows increased intensity of rainfall during dry periods, leading to over-estimation of wet days and under-estimation of dry days. Northern extreme of India (Jammu and Kashmir) show major differences in replicating the spell characteristics. Trend patterns are also not consistent between the three datasets. The present study will provide information on the spatio-temporal pattern of dry, wet and extreme wet spell characteristics over India and aid in selecting appropriate datasets for studying the Indian monsoon rainfall depending on their scope and application of research. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:38:08","2018-01-20 00:38:08","","204-218","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Water management; Water resources; dry season; Extremes; monsoon; water management; Drought; Floods; Flood control; Weather forecasting; spatial distribution; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; extreme event; Data integration; precipitation assessment; flood forecasting; Gages; raingauge; India; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Rain gages; Spatiotemporal patterns; Precipitation characteristics; Trends; wet season; APHRODITE; Climate prediction centers; Indian monsoon rainfall; Jammu and Kashmir; Spell characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Key findings include: (1) the increase in annual runoff associated with forest cover loss is statistically significant at multiple spatial scales whereas the effect of forest cover gain is statistically inconsistent; (2) the sensitivity of annual runoff to forest cover change tends to attenuate as watershed size increases only in large watersheds; (3) annual runoff is more sensitive to forest cover change in water-limited watersheds than in energy-limited watersheds across all spatial scales; and (4) small mixed forest-dominated watersheds or large snow-dominated watersheds are more hydrologically resilient to forest cover change.

The regional scale prediction of summer monsoon mean rainfall at longer lead time (e.g., predicting 3–4 months in advance) can play a vital role in planning of hydrological and agriculture aspects of the society. Previous attempts for predicting seasonal mean rainfall at regional level (over 5 Homogeneous regions) have resulted with limited success (anomaly correlation coefficient is low, ACC ≈ 0.1–0.4, even at a short lead time of one month). The high resolution Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2) model, with spectral resolution of T382 (∼38 km), can predict the Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) at lead time of 3–4 months, with a reasonably good prediction skill (ACC ≈ 0.55). In the present study, we have investigated whether the seasonal mean rainfall over different homogenous regions is predictable using the same model, at 3–4 months lead time? Out of five homogeneous regions of India three regions have shown moderate prediction skill, even at 3 months lead time. Compared to lower resolution model, high resolution model has good skill for all the regions except south peninsular India. High resolution model is able to capture the extreme events and also the teleconnections associated with large scale features at four months lead time and hence shows better skill (ACC ≈ 0.45) in predicting the seasonal mean rainfall over homogeneous regions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:38:41","2018-01-20 00:38:41","","103-112","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Teleconnections; prediction; Climatology; regional climate; monsoon; seasonality; Climate models; Forecasting; weather forecasting; climate prediction; precipitation assessment; India; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Dynamical predictions; High-resolution models; Homogenous region; Indian summer monsoon rainfall; Seasonal mean rainfall; Seasonal prediction; Summer monsoon rainfall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many studies have reported the generation patterns of subsurface saturation on valley side slopes or unchanneled catchments, studies focusing on the relationship between bedrock topography and subsurface saturation dynamics in a headwater catchment are still rare. This study therefore analyzed the effects of bedrock topographic features on subsurface saturation generation based on a dataset of pore water pressure (ψ) observations at the soil–bedrock interface and the spatial distributions of soil depth and the topographic wetness index (TWI) of bedrock topography in a steep natural forested headwater catchment. Temporal variations in the mean and standard deviation of ψ were lower at the perennially saturated points but higher at the ephemerally saturated points. The expansion patterns of subsurface saturation during storm events could be classified into four stages: fragmentary and unconnected distributions, both downward and upward expansions, interconnection from upslope to downslope, and disappearance from the middle slope. When saturation was interconnected, 41% of accumulated rainfall contributed to increases of subsurface saturation with a highly linear relationship. Soil depth correlated negatively with the increase in ψ at all points and at ephemerally saturated points. These negative correlations occurred frequently after the generation of new saturation, and remained for a short period around the early peaks of rainfall when the mean of ψ increased sharply. TWI correlated positively with ψ and ψ ⩾ 0 among all points but not in the subsets of perennially or ephemerally saturated points. The positive correlations became more significant after generation of new saturation. Overall, this study demonstrates that the effects of soil depth and TWI on subsurface saturation vary with space and time in a steep natural forested headwater catchment. These effects are combined in a short time when new saturation is generated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:38:57","2018-01-20 00:38:57","","405-418","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; Water; spatial distribution; Catchments; Forestry; Soils; Topography; subsurface flow; Spatial and temporal variation; Mean and standard deviations; bedrock; soil depth; headwater; saturation; porewater; Pore pressure; Pore-water pressures; Pressure distribution; Topographic features; Positive correlations; forested catchment; Topographic wetness index; Soil depth; tensiometer; Tensiometer; topographic mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been demonstrated that water heights over rivers from satellite altimetry can sensibly be used to deal with the growing lack of in situ discharge data. However, the altimetric discharge is often estimated from a single virtual station suffering from coarse temporal resolution, sometimes with data outages, poor modeling and inconsistent sampling. In this study, we propose a method to estimate daily river discharge using altimetric time series of an entire river basin including its tributaries. Here, we implement a linear dynamic model to (1) provide a scheme for data assimilation of multiple altimetric discharge along a river; (2) estimate daily discharge; (3) deal with data outages, and (4) smooth the estimated discharge. The model consists of a stochastic process model that benefits from the cyclostationary behavior of discharge. Our process model comprises the covariance and cross-covariance information of river discharge at different gauges. Combined with altimetric discharge time series, we solve the linear dynamic system using the Kalman filter and smoother providing unbiased discharge with minimum variance. We evaluate our method over the Niger basin, where we generate altimetric discharge using water level time series derived from missions ENVISAT, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2. Validation against in situ discharge shows that our method provides daily river discharge with an average correlation of 0.95, relative RMS error of 12%, relative bias of 10% and NSE coefficient of 0.7. Using a modified NSE-metric, that assesses the non-cyclostationary behavior, we show that our estimated discharge outperforms available legacy mean daily discharge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:39:45","2018-01-20 00:39:45","","230-247","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; river discharge; data assimilation; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Satellites; Watersheds; in situ measurement; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Random processes; river basin; Water levels; time series; Kalman filter; stochasticity; water level; estimation method; diurnal variation; spatial resolution; satellite altimetry; Kalman filters; River discharge; Geodetic satellites; Envisat; Niger Basin; smoothing; Aneroid altimeters; ENVISAT; Jason; Jason-2; Linear control systems; Niger; SARAL; SARAL/AltiKa; Satellite altimetry; Timing jitter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the lack of reliable data on past events renders the implementation of appropriate adaptation policies a difficult task, and therefore also hampers the mitigation of future disasters. In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, we combine reconstructed paleoflood events based on tree-ring analyses with existing systematic records, so as to derive a regional flood frequency. Analysis was realized with tree-ring records and through the dating of growth disturbances in riparian trees of major rivers in Kullu district (Himachal Pradesh, Indian Himalayas). To this end, we combined field-based observations, tree-ring analyses, hydraulic modelling and statistical approaches. Results suggest that the occurrence of floods in Kullu district is recurrent, with a marked seasonality and a cyclic natural variability in flood frequency at multi-decadal scales, as well as distinct spatial representativeness. The inclusion of peak discharge data of past, previously ungauged, flood events derived from tree-ring records has a significant and positive impact on the flood frequency assessment. Flood hazards and associated risks have been clearly underestimated in the region and based on the systematic records alone. We also demonstrate that a regional flood frequency approach is suitable to optimize the information gathered from tree rings and that flood frequency can thus be analyzed for larger regions. The approach used in this paper can be implemented in the other, poorly gauged region and thus contribute to climate change adaptation policies in undocumented environments such as the Indian Himalayan Region. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 00:40:00","2018-01-20 00:40:00","","140-149","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; tree ring; climate change; Tree rings; Floods; Hazards; Forestry; Trees (mathematics); hazard assessment; peak discharge; hydraulic conductivity; adaptive management; India; riparian vegetation; Statistical approach; paleoflood; flood frequency; Himalayas; Flood frequency; Himachal Pradesh; Adaptation policies; Kullu; Kullu district; Regional flood frequencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, microbially mediated transformations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are recognized to determine the balance of DOC in soils. So far, only few studies utilized stable water isotope information in modeling and even fewer linked dissolved carbon fluxes to mixing and/or transport models. In this study, stormflow dynamics of 18O/16O ratios in the water molecules (expressed as δ18O) and DOC were analyzed using a physically-based modeling approach. A one-dimensional dual-continuum vertical flow and transport model was used to simulate the subsurface transport processes in a forest hillslope soil over a period of 2.5 years. The model was applied to describe the transformation of input signals of δ18O and DOC into output signals observed in the hillslope stormflow. To quantify uncertainty associated with the model parameterization, Monte Carlo analysis in conjunction with Latin hypercube sampling was applied. δ18O variations in hillslope discharge and in soil pore water were predicted reasonably well. Despite the complex nature of microbial transformations that caused uncertainty in model parameters and subsequent prediction of DOC transport, the simulated temporal patterns of DOC concentration in stormflow showed similar behavior to that reflected in the observed DOC fluxes. Due to preferential flow, the contribution of the hillslope DOC export was higher than the amounts that are usually found in the available literature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:40:17","2018-01-20 00:40:17","","309-325","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","catchment; discharge; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; runoff; Catchments; Storms; soil water; Soils; hillslope; Organic carbon; microbial activity; Stream flow; Dissolved oxygen; Isotopes; water chemistry; dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic carbon; oxygen isotope; Dissolution; transport process; permeability; Pore pressure; Molecules; decomposition; sorption; Dual permeability model; Monte carlo analysis; Oxygen isotopes; Preferential transport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is demonstrated that the effective K of randomly-varied coarse-textured soils generally falls between the harmonic and geometric means of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of the constituting soils. Layering and random variability when occurring concurrently magnify each other's effects on effective K. As a result, the higher the degree of heterogeneity, the lower the effective K.

However, the topic of whether the muddy water in the middle Yellow River run clearer remains debatable, and, in fact, response to the topic is reasonably well documented in regard to hydrological changes in the sediment source area. Six sub-catchments nested in the Beiluo River basin – one of the major sediment sources for the Yellow River – were selected, with data series ranging from 1957 to 2009. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used for trend detection. A simple method was developed based on the distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) versus water discharge. Using this method, we evaluated the quantities of sediment yield reduction attributed to streamflow and SSC changes due to the two strategies. The results showed that annual sediment yield in 5 out of 6 stations significantly decreased, with rates varying from −4 to −217 t·km−2·yr−1. Significant decreases in daily and event streamflow and suspended sediment concentration were identified, especially at a high SSC (top 1–5%). During the integrated soil conservation period, the sediment yield was reduced mainly by decreases in high flow and high SSC conditions. In contrast, during the “Grain for Green” period, sediment yield was reduced due to decreases in streamflow and SSC at all magnitudes. It was concluded that rainfall-sediment load dynamics have changed in the context of ecological restoration. Changes in both streamflow and the SSC–water discharge relationship induced the sediment yield reduction over time; in other words, the streamflow in the middle reaches of Yellow River became clearer during periods of ecological restoration. Moreover, the increased annual sediment yield at the Zhangcunyi station exposed a risk of increased erosion in areas where forests had been well preserved. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:40:50","2018-01-20 00:40:50","","357-369","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; river discharge; streamflow; Ecology; Rivers; Sedimentation; Sediments; concentration (composition); hydrological change; Catchments; Landforms; sediment-water interface; Soil conservation; Stream flow; Conservation; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi; Ecological restoration; Hydrological changes; sediment yield; Sediment yields; Suspended sediments; soil conservation; suspended sediment; Suspended sediment concentrations; Restoration; restoration ecology; Yellow River; Beiluo River; Conservation projects; Sediment source areas; Sediment sources","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Root channels can result in macropore flow which strongly influences soil infiltration. Prior research has addressed the influence of vegetation on erosion and runoff, but the effects of root channels on infiltration capacity are less studied. In this study, we studied the root channels and soil water infiltration rates in ten artificial grasslands in an arid area. The results showed that the average root channel diameter (ARCD) of leguminous grasslands and of shrub grasslands were greater than that of gramineous grasslands (p &lt; 0.05). Importantly, the ARCD and root channel area (RCA) were significantly and positively related to the average infiltration rate in stage I (AIRS I) and the initial infiltration rate (IIR). The IIR and the AIRS I increased at rates of 31.13 and 14.60 mm h−1, respectively, and at the same time there was an increase in ARCD. Overall, our results suggest that root channels played a significant role in the matrix infiltration capacity, resulting in a higher infiltration rate in leguminous grasslands and in mixed sown grasslands than in gramineous grasslands. We suggest that leguminous grasslands or the combination of leguminous and gramineous species in grassland should be given greater attention as suitable materials for mine-soil reclamation in arid regions.

While these findings are mainly based on studies from alpine and Northern-latitude areas (including permafrost areas), little is known about the significance of soil frost for hydrology in pre-alpine areas, i.e. the region at the transition from central European lowlands to high-alpine areas. Here I synthesize soil temperature data and soil frost observations from ten sites in Switzerland to assess the occurrence of soil frost and to determine its impact on catchment runoff. In addition, a well-established numerical model was used to reconstruct the presence of soil frost in two first-order catchments for single runoff events and winters. The data clearly demonstrates that shallow soil frost has formed regularly in this altitudinal range over the past decade. The presence of a frozen soil surface was found to be highly variable among the sites under study and did not significantly correlate with altitude or forest density. For the first-order catchments, it was not possible to relate important flood peaks or increased runoff coefficients to winter situations with substantial soil frost. Thus, the present analysis suggests that although soil frost is widespread and regularly occurring at this altitudinal range, it has no significant impact on winter runoff in pre-alpine watersheds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:41:23","2018-01-20 00:41:23","","90-102","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; Snow; catchment; hydrology; Flood control; numerical model; runoff; watershed; water flow; Catchments; Forestry; Soils; Switzerland; soil temperature; soil surface; snow cover; Frozen soils; Runoff coefficients; frozen ground; forest; Snow covers; Alpine catchments; Alpine watershed; Catchment runoffs; frost; Northern latitudes; Soil temperature data; subalpine environment; Subalpine forests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The connection between maximum velocity and celerities estimated by means of experimental techniques has not been explored. To assess the pattern of infiltrating water front and dominant flow direction, we performed sprinkling experiments at a trenched plot in the Weierbach catchment in Luxembourg. Maximum velocities and wetting front celerities were inferred at different depths using artificial tracers, soil moisture measurements (TDR), and geophysical techniques. The flow direction was predominantly vertical within the observed plot, with almost no lateral flow observed until depths of 2–3 m; shallow trench flow was intermittent and associated with preferential flow. Average celerity estimates using TDR and geophysical techniques were equal to 707 ± 234 mm h−1 and 971 ± 625 mm h−1, respectively. Vertical maximum velocity estimates were tracer-dependent and had very variable ranges: 109.3 ± 89.3 mm h−1 (Cl−), 177.8 ± 199.1 mm h−1 (Br−), and 604.1 ± 610.7 mm h−1 (Li+). Preferential flow processes were inferred from maximum velocities apparently greater than celerities and scattered trench flow with highly variable tracer concentrations. The high variability between maximum velocities of different tracers indicated a complex pattern of tracer movement through the soil, not captured by celerity values alone. Our study demonstrated the importance to assess both velocities and celerities to understand flow dynamics in response to sprinkling while information on the wetting front alone would have missed important preferential flow processes. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 00:41:39","2018-01-20 00:41:39","","28-43","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","catchment; soil moisture; Groundwater flow; preferential flow; Preferential flows; concentration (composition); Geophysics; Catchments; experimental study; Soil moisture; tracer; Soil moisture measurement; tomography; time domain reflectometry; Velocity; flow velocity; Wetting; wetting front; Geophysical techniques; Artificial tracers; Complex pattern; Diekirch; Experimental techniques; Luxembourg [Benelux]; Luxembourg [Luxembourg (DST)]; Luxembourg [Luxembourg (NTN)]; Maximum velocity; Tracer concentration; Weierbach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is extremely important because the rate and timing of snowpack drainage has substantial consequences to aquifer recharge patterns, which in turn affect groundwater availability throughout the rest of the year. The modeling methods developed to estimate drainage from a snowpack, which typically rely on temporally-dense point-measurements or temporally-limited spatially-dispersed calibration data, range in complexity from the simple degree-day method to more complex and physically-based energy balance approaches. While the gamut of snowmelt models are routinely used to aid in water resource management, a comparison of snowmelt models’ predictive uncertainties had previously not been done. Therefore, we established a snowmelt model calibration dataset that is both temporally dense and represents the integrated snowmelt infiltration signal for the Vers Chez le Brandt research catchment, which functions as a rather unique natural lysimeter. We then evaluated the uncertainty associated with the degree-day, a modified degree-day and energy balance snowmelt model predictions using the null-space Monte Carlo approach. All three melt models underestimate total snowpack drainage, underestimate the rate of early and midwinter drainage and overestimate spring snowmelt rates. The actual rate of snowpack water loss is more constant over the course of the entire winter season than the snowmelt models would imply, indicating that mid-winter melt can contribute as significantly as springtime snowmelt to groundwater recharge in low alpine settings. Further, actual groundwater recharge could be between 2 and 31% greater than snowmelt models suggest, over the total winter season. This study shows that snowmelt model predictions can have considerable uncertainty, which may be reduced by the inclusion of more data that allows for the use of more complex approaches such as the energy balance method. Further, our study demonstrated that an uncertainty analysis of model predictions is easily accomplished due to the low computational demand of the models and efficient calibration software and is absolutely worth the additional investment. Lastly, development of a systematic instrumentation that evaluates the distributed, temporal evolution of snowpack drainage is vital for optimal understanding and management of cold-climate hydrologic systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:41:55","2018-01-20 00:41:55","","16-27","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Snow; Water management; Water resources; catchment; groundwater; snowpack; Uncertainty; software; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Forecasting; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; infiltration; karst hydrology; Investments; uncertainty analysis; Catchments; resource management; recharge; energy balance; Energy balance; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; Snowmelt; Infiltration; Recharging (underground waters); snow cover; measurement method; Recharge; Karst; Day degree","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydrologically-controlled leaching plots have often shown RBS to be effective at buffering nutrients and pesticides, but uncontrolled field studies have sometimes suggested limited effectiveness. The limited RBS effectiveness may be explained by the spatiotemporal hydrological heterogeneity near non-irrigated fields. This hypothesis was tested in conventional corn and soy fields in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of southern Quebec (Canada), where spring melt brings heavy and rapid runoff, while summer months are hot and dry. One field with a mineral soil (Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan) and another with an organic-rich soil (Boisbriand) were equipped with passive runoff collectors, suction cup lysimeters, and piezometers placed before and after a 3 m-wide RBS, and monitored from 2011 to 2014. Soil topography of the RBS was mapped to a 1 cm vertical precision and a 50 cm sampling grid. On average, surface runoff intersects the RBS perpendicularly, but is subject to substantial local heterogeneity. Groundwater saturates the root zones, but flows little at the time of snowmelt. Groundwater flow is not consistently perpendicular to the RBS, and may reverse, flowing from stream to field under low water flow regimes with stream-aquifer connectivity, thus affecting RBS effectiveness calculations. Groundwater flow direction can be influenced by stratigraphy, local soil hydraulic properties, and historical modification of the agricultural stream beds. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of surface and groundwater flows is essential to correctly assess the effectiveness of RBS in intercepting agro-chemical pollution. The implicit assumption that water flows across vegetated RBS, from the field to the stream, should always be verified. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:42:07","2018-01-20 00:42:07","","276-288","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; connectivity; groundwater; surface water; topography; Rivers; Groundwater flow; heterogeneity; Hydraulics; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Agriculture; runoff; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Flow of water; groundwater flow; Soil hydraulic properties; Soils; buffer zone; riparian zone; Surface waters; maize; Zea mays; agricultural land; River pollution; leaching; Stratigraphy; Hydrological heterogeneity; Agricultural watersheds; Surface water and groundwaters; Agricultural runoff; soybean; Saint Lawrence Lowlands; Groundwater flow directions; Micro-basins; Riparian buffer strips; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the 1950s, there has been afforestation measure to control soil erosion and improve ecosystem services on the plateau. However, the introduction of exotic tree species (e.g., R. pseudoacacia, P. tabulaeformis and C. korshinskii) and high-density planting has had a negative effect on soil moisture content (SMC) in the region. Any decrease in SMC could worsen soil water shortage in both the top and deep soil layers, further endangering the sustainability of the fragile ecosystem. This study analyzed the variations in SMC following the conversion of croplands into forests in the Loess Plateau. SMC data within the 5-m soil profile were collected at 50 sites in the plateau region via field survey, long-term in-situ observations and documented literature. The study showed that for the 50 sites, the depth-averaged SMC was much lower under forest than under cropland. Based on in-situ measurements of SMC in agricultural plots and C. korshinskii plots in 2004–2014, SMC in the 0–4 m soil profile in both plots declined significantly (p &lt; 0.01) during the growing season. The rate of decline in SMC in various soil layers under C. korshinskii plots (−0.008 to −0.016 cm3 cm−3 yr−1) was much higher than those under agricultural plots (−0.004 to −0.005 cm3 cm−3 yr−1). This suggested that planting C. korshinskii intensified soil moisture decline in China's Loess Plateau. In the first 20–25 yr of growth, the depth-averaged SMC gradually decreased with stand age in R. pseudoacacia plantation, but SMC somehow recovered with increasing tree age over the 25-year period. Irrespectively, artificial forests consumed more deep soil moisture than cultivated crops in the study area, inducing soil desiccation and dry soil layer formation. Thus future afforestation should consider those species that use less water and require less thinning for sustainable soil conservation without compromising future water resources demands in the Loess Plateau. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:42:24","2018-01-20 00:42:24","","113-122","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water resources; soil moisture; Ecology; Sediments; Land use; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Cultivation; Water conservation; Erosion; Forestry; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Landforms; ecosystem service; Soil surveys; Soil conservation; land use; Conservation; deciduous tree; Reforestation; Moisture; Loess Plateau; Loess plateau of chinas; In-situ measurement; arid environment; In-situ observations; China's loess plateaux; soil conservation; growing season; soil profile; field survey; afforestation; Afforestation age; Agricultural plots; Exotic tree species; soil ecosystem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of snow in such mountainous environments remains rather challenging. We therefore developed a snow depth meter using small temperature loggers. Small temperature loggers were attached to poles at 20 cm intervals from the ground surface. Snow depths were estimated by assessing the daily variations in temperatures. Using this snow depth meter, we continuously observed snow depths at 21 stations in a forested catchment in Japan over three winter seasons. Using correlation analysis, we then analyzed the influence of topography (i.e., elevation and aspect) and forest (i.e., canopy openness) on snow depths. Moreover, we estimated daily snow distributions in the area using multi-regression analysis, thus describing seasonal characteristics of snow distributions. Finally we investigated the relation between number of stations and estimation accuracies of snow distributions using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. We observed that the influence of topographical and forest characteristics changed considerably during the study period, with elevation having a major impact on snow depths. Further, aspect and forest cover had a great influence on the snow depths during the melting period. The regression of elevation slopes was 0.8–2.1 mm/m during rich snow years and 0.5–0.6 mm/m in little snow years. Also, the snow distribution during the melting period was found to be less uniform than during the snow accumulation period using histograms of snow depths. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis shows that one station per 2.0–2.5 ha is enough to estimate accurate snow distributions. Given the above, we concluded that our proposed approach was quite useful for investigating the influence of topography and forest characteristics on snow accumulation and melting. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:42:40","2018-01-20 00:42:40","","289-298","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Correlation analysis; Regression analysis; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Snow; snowpack; regression analysis; topography; Monte Carlo methods; Monte Carlo analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; sensor; Catchments; Forestry; Topography; diurnal variation; forest cover; Snow melting systems; snow cover; snow accumulation; Melting; melting; Forest; forested catchment; Face recognition; Hydrological balance; Low-cost sensors; Mountainous environment; Multi-regression analysis; Observation; Seasonal characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The VPMM method does not require rigorous calibration and validation procedures as required in the case of NLM method due to established relationships of its parameters with flow and channel characteristics based on hydrodynamic principles. The parameters of the conceptual nonlinear storage equation used in the NLM method were calibrated using the Artificial Intelligence Application (AIA) techniques, such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Differential Evolution (DE), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Harmony Search (HS). The calibration was carried out on a given set of hypothetical flood events obtained by routing a given inflow hydrograph in a set of 40 km length prismatic channel reaches using the Saint-Venant (SV) equations. The validation of the calibrated NLM method was investigated using a different set of hypothetical flood hydrographs obtained in the same set of channel reaches used for calibration studies. Both the sets of solutions obtained in the calibration and validation cases using the NLM method were compared with the corresponding solutions of the VPMM method based on some pertinent evaluation measures.

It consists of making use of statistical relationships between a component series estimate and the residual errors of the water mass balance series. Through this approach, two novel specific techniques are developed. The first, ‘precipitation-decorrelation’, entails implementing a criterion of decorrelation of residual errors from precipitation estimates. The second, ‘residual-redistribution’, consists of redistributing each residual error over initial water balance component estimates, in accord with an error minimization criterion for each component series. Efficacy is tested using series of annual water balances for the Tahoe Basin. Upon implementation of precipitation-decorrelation, a tightly bounded statistical estimate of mean annual Lake Tahoe evaporation is obtained, which closely matches independent measurement-based estimates. Residual-redistribution yields revised estimates of annual series of Tahoe areal precipitation and watershed runoff, which are each shown to have substantially reduced random error variance. Highly precise revised estimates of inter-annual variations in Tahoe precipitation have enabled resolution of the watershed multi-year ‘memory’ of precipitation, and more reliable separation of inter-annual changes in watershed storage from inter-annual variations in atmospheric loss. © 2017 The Authors","2017","2018-01-20 00:43:29","2018-01-20 00:43:29","","326-340","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; evaporation; Water balance; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; hydrological modeling; runoff; watershed; Watersheds; uncertainty analysis; Lakes; error analysis; Errors; precipitation assessment; estimation method; annual variation; Water balance components; Interannual variation; Statistical relationship; Annual water balance; Error analysis; Independent measurement; residual flow; Lake Tahoe; Tahoe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results document the occurrence in time of multiple peaks in the mean and variance of flux-averaged concentrations at the extraction well operating at a transient rate. Our findings suggest that lowest and largest values of mean and variance of flux-averaged concentration at the well tend to occur at the same time. We show that uncertainty associated with detected BTCs at the well increases for pumping regimes displaying a high degree of temporal variability. As such, the choice of the type of engineering control to the temporal sequence of pumping rates could represent a key factor to drive quantification of uncertainty of the contaminant concentration detected at the well. It is documented that pumping rate fluctuations induce a temporally oscillating risk pattern at the well, thus suggesting that the selection of a dynamic pumping regime has a clear influence on the temporal evolution of risk at the well. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:43:45","2018-01-20 00:43:45","","490-502","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Contamination; Risk assessment; Risk analysis; Hydrogeology; hydrogeology; heterogeneity; Monte Carlo analysis; Heterogeneity; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; risk assessment; Extraction; pollutant transport; Stochastic systems; stochasticity; hydraulic conductivity; Pumps; Hydraulic conductivity; pumping; temporal evolution; transient flow; operations technology; Contaminant transport; Well pumps; Engineering controls; Stochastic hydrogeology; Well pumping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nutrient markets usually include agricultural nonpoint sources and municipal and industrial point sources, but these markets rarely include investors who construct wetlands to sell nutrient reduction credits. We propose a new market design for trading nutrient credits, with both point source and non-point source traders, explicitly incorporating the option of landowners to build nutrient removal wetlands. The proposed trading program is designed as a smart market with centralized clearing, done with an optimization. The market design addresses the varying impacts of runoff over space and time, and the lumpiness of wetland investments. We simulated the market for the Big Bureau Creek watershed in north-central Illinois. We found that the proposed smart market would incentivize wetland construction by assuring reasonable payments for the ecosystem services provided. The proposed market mechanism selects wetland locations strategically taking into account both the cost and nutrient removal efficiencies. The centralized market produces locational prices that would incentivize farmers to reduce nutrients, which is voluntary. As we illustrate, wetland builders’ participation in nutrient trading would enable the point sources and environmental organizations to buy low cost nutrient credits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:44:02","2018-01-20 00:44:02","","248-261","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; optimization; Optimization; design method; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Economics; Investments; pollutant removal; ecosystem service; Illinois; Nutrients; Costs; market conditions; constructed wetland; Wetlands; Commerce; nutrient; Agricultural nonpoint sources; credit provision; point source pollution; Nutrient trading; incentive; pricing policy; Centralized market; Constructed wetlands; Environmental organizations; Nutrient removal efficiency; Smart markets; Wetland construction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon-14 groundwater ages were found to increase with depth and distance (&lt;1000 y near the recharge area to &gt;30,000 y near the coast), confirming that the system is semi-confined and the palaeometeoric origin of groundwater as suggested by water stable isotopes. The presence of old groundwater near the top of deep semi-confined aquifers suggests that recharge mainly occurs in the ranges east of the basin. This is also supported by Cl concentrations, which are higher in the overlying Quaternary aquifers. Groundwater flow velocities between 0.3 and 1.8 m y−1 were estimated using 14C ages, resulting in basin recharge estimates between 0.3 × 107 and 2 × 107 m3 y−1. Radiocarbon and 4He-estimated flow velocities were generally in good agreement, although 4He accumulation rates ranging between 8 × 10−12 and 1 × 10−10 cm3 STP g−1 y−1 and 1.7–7.1 × 10−7 cm3 STP g−1 km−1 confirmed slower flow velocities in some areas.

These reservoirs are overlain by less permeable rocks, whereas the surface geology is characterized by outcrops of Oligo-Miocene carbonate units hosting important aquifers. Some of the karst springs of the area are used as drinking water supplies, and therefore these vulnerable aquifers should be monitored and protected adequately. In the early afternoon (14:00) of 27 May until the late evening (19:30) of 28 May 2011, during the construction of an exploitation borehole (Tresauro 2), more than 1000 m3 of drilling fluids were lost in an unknown karst void. Two days later, from 06:30 on 30 May, water flowing from Paradiso Spring, lying some 13.7 km SW of the borehole and 378 m lower, normally used as a domestic water supply, was so intensely coloured that it was unfit for drinking. Bulk chemical analyses carried out on the water have shown a composition that is very similar to that of the drilling fluids lost at the Tresauro borehole, confirming a hydrological connection. Estimations indicate that the first signs of the drilling fluids took about 59 h to flow from their injection point to the spring, corresponding to a mean velocity of ∼230 m/h. That Paradiso Spring is recharged by a well-developed underground drainage system is also confirmed by the marked flow rate changes measured at the spring, ranging from a base flow of around 10–15 l/s to flood peaks of 2–3 m3/s. Reflecting the source and nature of the initial contamination, the pollution lasted for just a few days, and the water returned to acceptable drinking-water standards relatively quickly. However, pollution related to heavy-mineral fines continues to be registered during flooding of the spring, when the aqueducts are normally shut down because of the high turbidity values. This pollution event offers an instructive example of how hydrocarbon exploitation in intensely karstified areas, where natural springs provide domestic water supplies, should be controlled effectively to prevent such disasters occurring. This pollution incident is also a useful example of how such “accidental” tracer tests can identify rapid karstic flowpaths over long distances. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:44:35","2018-01-20 00:44:35","","123-132","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Sicily; water supply; Hydrogeology; Floods; Pollution; Flood control; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Water pollution; Potable water; Water; karst hydrology; Water supply; water flow; Flow of water; Disaster prevention; Landforms; Chemical analysis; Geology; karst; exploitation; water pollution; Minerals; Hydrocarbons; Karst aquifer; borehole; Drilling fluids; Springs (water); Artificial tracing; barium; Barium; Boring; Bulk chemical analysis; carbonate rock; disaster; Domestic water supply; Drinking water standards; heavy mineral; Petroleum deposits; petroleum hydrocarbon; Petroleum prospecting; Pollution incidents; Ragusa [Sicily]; Underground drainage; Underground water flow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The procedure was introduced to build ensemble precipitation forecasts based on the statistical relationship between observations and forecasts. More specifically, the approach relies on a transfer function that is developed based on a bivariate joint distribution between the observations and the simulations in the historical period. The transfer function is used to post-process the forecast. In this study, we propose a Bayesian EPP approach based on copula functions (COP-EPP) to improve the reliability of the precipitation ensemble forecast. Evaluation of the copula-based method is carried out by comparing the performance of the generated ensemble precipitation with the outputs from an existing procedure, i.e. mixed type meta-Gaussian distribution. Monthly precipitation from Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFS) and gridded observation from Parameter-Elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) have been employed to generate the post-processed ensemble precipitation. Deterministic and probabilistic verification frameworks are utilized in order to evaluate the outputs from the proposed technique. Distribution of seasonal precipitation for the generated ensemble from the copula-based technique is compared to the observation and raw forecasts for three sub-basins located in the Western United States. Results show that both techniques are successful in producing reliable and unbiased ensemble forecast, however, the COP-EPP demonstrates considerable improvement in the ensemble forecast in both deterministic and probabilistic verification, in particular in characterizing the extreme events in wet seasons. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:44:52","2018-01-20 00:44:52","","476-489","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","simulation; Bayesian analysis; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Forecasting; Weather forecasting; seasonal variation; weather forecasting; Distribution functions; extreme event; Function evaluation; ensemble forecasting; precipitation intensity; Precipitation (chemical); Hydrologic forecasting; Transfer functions; Statistical relationship; Seasonal precipitations; Copulas; Climate forecasts; Ensemble post-processing; Post processing; Probabilistic verification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the investigation of 18O and 2H stable isotopes and radiogenic radium of different water endmembers in three representative lakes of Badain-E, Badain-W and Sumujilin-S in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD), the fourth largest desert in the world. A stable 18O and 2H isotopic buildup model is constructed to classify the hydrologic conditions of the desert lakes by estimating the ratio between groundwater discharge rate (Fin) and lake surface evaporation (E). Then the radium mass balance models are developed to quantify Fin. Based on the obtained Fin/E and Fin, Badain-E, Badain-W and Sumujilin-S are classified as flowing through, terminal and desiccating lakes, respectively, and their hydrologic partition is obtained. The groundwater discharge rate of Badain-E, Badain-W and Sumujilin-S, is estimated to be 8–10 mm d−1, 4–5 mm d−1, and 7–8 mm d−1, respectively. The total groundwater discharge to the lake areas in the BJD is about 1.68 × 105 m3 d−1. The flow-through condition explains the existence of the fresh lakes, while the terminal and desiccating conditions lead to the lake salinization over time.

Some methods had been proposed to interpolate the spatial distributions of soil psf, but the performance of compositional kriging and different log-ratio kriging methods is still unclear. Four log-ratio transformations, including additive log-ratio (alr), centered log-ratio (clr), isometric log-ratio (ilr), and symmetry log-ratio (slr), combined with ordinary kriging (log-ratio kriging: alr_OK, clr_OK, ilr_OK and slr_OK) were selected to be compared with compositional kriging (CK) for the spatial prediction of soil psf in Tianlaochi of Heihe River Basin, China. Root mean squared error (RMSE), Aitchison's distance (AD), standardized residual sum of squares (STRESS) and right ratio of the predicted soil texture types (RR) were chosen to evaluate the accuracy for different interpolators. The results showed that CK had a better accuracy than the four log-ratio kriging methods. The RMSE (sand, 9.27%; silt, 7.67%; clay, 4.17%), AD (0.45), STRESS (0.60) of CK were the lowest and the RR (58.65%) was the highest in the five interpolators. The clr_OK achieved relatively better performance than the other log-ratio kriging methods. In addition, CK presented reasonable and smooth transition on mapping soil psf according to the environmental factors.

Both observational and modeling studies have been extensively employed to characterize hydrological changes and trends, assess the impact of climate variability or provide future scenarios of water resources. In the aim of a better understanding of hydrological changes, it is of crucial importance to determine how and to what extent trends and long-term oscillations detectable in hydrological variables are linked to global climate oscillations. In this work, we develop an approach associating correlation between large and local scales, empirical statistical downscaling and wavelet multiresolution decomposition of monthly precipitation and streamflow over the Seine river watershed, and the North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) in order to gain additional insights on the atmospheric patterns associated with the regional hydrology. We hypothesized that: (i) atmospheric patterns may change according to the different temporal wavelengths defining the variability of the signals; and (ii) definition of those hydrological/circulation relationships for each temporal wavelength may improve the determination of large-scale predictors of local variations. The results showed that the links between large and local scales were not necessarily constant according to time-scale (i.e. for the different frequencies characterizing the signals), resulting in changing spatial patterns across scales. This was then taken into account by developing an empirical statistical downscaling (ESD) modeling approach, which integrated discrete wavelet multiresolution analysis for reconstructing monthly regional hydrometeorological processes (predictand: precipitation and streamflow on the Seine river catchment) based on a large-scale predictor (SLP over the Euro-Atlantic sector). This approach basically consisted in three steps: 1 – decomposing large-scale climate and hydrological signals (SLP field, precipitation or streamflow) using discrete wavelet multiresolution analysis, 2 – generating a statistical downscaling model per time-scale, 3 – summing up all scale-dependent models in order to obtain a final reconstruction of the predictand. The results obtained revealed a significant improvement of the reconstructions for both precipitation and streamflow when using the multiresolution ESD model instead of basic ESD. In particular, the multiresolution ESD model handled very well the significant changes in variance through time observed in either precipitation or streamflow. For instance, the post-1980 period, which had been characterized by particularly high amplitudes in interannual-to-interdecadal variability associated with alternating flood and extremely low-flow/drought periods (e.g., winter/spring 2001, summer 2003), could not be reconstructed without integrating wavelet multiresolution analysis into the model. In accordance with previous studies, the wavelet components detected in SLP, precipitation and streamflow on interannual to interdecadal time-scales could be interpreted in terms of influence of the Gulf-Stream oceanic front on atmospheric circulation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:45:58","2018-01-20 00:45:58","","262-275","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Atlantic Ocean; Climate change; Runoff; Water resources; atmospheric circulation; downscaling; sea level pressure; streamflow; wavelet analysis; Climatology; Statistical downscaling; design method; Rivers; Climate models; global change; Meteorology; watershed; Watersheds; hydrological change; Catchments; France; empirical analysis; Sea level; temporal variation; climate effect; hydrometeorology; Time measurement; Stream flow; Hydrological variability; Atmospheric circulation; Hydrological variables; Atlantic Ocean (North); wavelength; Decomposition; Wavelet decomposition; Gulf Stream; Ocean currents; Inter-decadal variability; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Global climate oscillations; Multiresolution analysis; Seine River [France]; Wavelet multi-resolution analysis; Wavelet multiresolution decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present work a simple regression equation for monthly groundwater recharge estimation is developed by relating simulated recharge from a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment tool (SWAT) model to effective precipitation. Monthly groundwater recharge and actual evapotranspiration (AET) were computed by applying a calibrated (SWAT) model for a ten year period (2005–2015) in Vosvozis river basin in NE Greece. SWAT actual evapotranspiration (AET) results were compared to remotely sensed AET values from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), indicating the integrity of the modeling process. Water isotopes of 2H and 18O, originally presented herein, were used to infer recharge resources in the basin and provided additional evidence of the applicability of the developed formula. Results showed that the developed recharge estimation method can be effectively applied using MODIS evapotranspiration data, without having to adhere to numerical modeling which is many times constrained by the lack of available data especially in poorly gauged basins. Future trends of groundwater recharge up to 2100 using an ensemble of five downscaled climate change projections indicated that annual recharge will increase up to the middle of the present century and gradually decrease thereafter. However, the predicted magnitude is highly variable depending on the Global Climate Model (GCM) used. While winter recharge will likely increase in the future, summer recharge is expected to decrease as a result of temperature rise in the future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:46:14","2018-01-20 00:46:14","","1-13","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Greece; groundwater; potential evapotranspiration; satellite data; remote sensing; climate change; hydrological modeling; Climate models; Groundwater; soil and water assessment tool; Soil and water assessment tool; Remote sensing; Numerical methods; Budget control; river basin; Climate change impact; estimation method; climate effect; water budget; Ground water recharge; recharge; Actual evapotranspiration; MODIS; SWAT model; Climate change projections; Recharging (underground waters); Radiometers; Image reconstruction; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite imagery; MODIS evapotranspiration data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitrate sensors have the capability for making accurate, high-frequency measurements of nitrate in situ, but have not yet been evaluated for long-term use in groundwater wells. We measured in situ nitrate continuously in two groundwater monitoring wells —one rural and one urban—located in the recharge zone of a productive karst aquifer in central Texas in order to resolve changes that occur over both short-term (hourly to daily) and long-term (monthly to yearly) periods. Nitrate concentrations, measured as nitrate-nitrogen in milligrams per liter (mg/L), during drought conditions showed little or no temporal change as groundwater levels declined. During aquifer recharge, extremely rapid changes in concentration occurred at both wells as documented by hourly data. At both sites, nitrate concentrations were affected by recharging surface water as evidenced by nitrate concentrations in groundwater recharge (0.8–1.3 mg/L) that were similar to previously reported values for regional recharging streams. Groundwater nitrate concentrations responded differently at urban and rural sites during groundwater recharge. Concentrations at the rural well (approximately 1.0 mg/L) increased as a result of higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater recharge relative to ambient nitrate concentrations in groundwater, whereas concentrations at the urban well (approximately 2.7 mg/L) decreased as a result of the dilution of higher ambient nitrate concentrations relative to those in groundwater recharge. Notably, nitrate concentrations decreased to as low as 0.8 mg/L at the urban site during recharge but postrecharge concentrations exceeded 3.0 mg/L. A return to higher nitrate concentrations postrecharge indicates mobilization of a localized source of elevated nitrate within the urbanized area of the aquifer. Changes in specific conductance were observed at both sites during groundwater recharge, and a significant correlation between specific conductance and nitrate (correlation coefficient [R] = 0.455) was evident at the urban site where large (3-fold) changes in nitrate occurred. Nitrate concentrations and specific conductance measured during a depth profile indicated that the water column was generally homogeneous as expected for this karst environment, but changes were observed in the most productive zone of the aquifer that might indicate some heterogeneity within the complex network of flow paths. Resolving the timing and magnitude of changes and characterizing fine-scale vertical differences would not be possible using conventional sampling techniques. The patterns observed in situ provided new insight into the dynamic nature of nitrate in a karst groundwater system. © 2017","2017","2018-01-20 00:46:31","2018-01-20 00:46:31","","179-188","","","546","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; groundwater; Drought; heterogeneity; aquifer; Aquifers; concentration (composition); Groundwater; Groundwater resources; nitrate; Nitrate concentration; spatiotemporal analysis; karst hydrology; sensor; Landforms; Nitrates; Surface waters; water level; Complex networks; Texas; Ground water recharge; recharge; Rural areas; Urban growth; Recharging (underground waters); Correlation coefficient; measurement method; High frequency measurements; Groundwater monitoring wells; Karst; dose-response relationship; Edwards aquifer; Optical sensors; Urban and rural sites","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Mississippi River basin (MRB) is considered as a representative large-scale basin, and daily streamflow from a network of 1663 stations are analyzed. Six community structure methods are employed: edge betweenness, greedy algorithm, multilevel modularity optimization, leading eigenvector, label propagation, and walktrap. The influence of correlation threshold (i.e. spatial correlation in flow between stations) on classification (i.e. community formation) is examined. The consistency among the methods in classifying catchments is assessed, using a normalized mutual information (NMI) index. An attempt is also made to explain the community formation in terms of river network/branching and some important catchment/flow properties. The results indicate that the correlation threshold has a notable influence on the number and size of communities identified and that there is a high level of consistency in the performance among the methods (except for the leading eigenvector method at lower thresholds). The results also reveal that only a few communities combine to represent a majority of the catchments, with the 10 largest communities (roughly 4% of the total number of communities) representing almost two-thirds of the catchments. Community formation is found to be influenced not only by geographic proximity but also, more importantly, by the organization of the river network (i.e. main stem and subsequent branching). Some communities are found to exhibit a greater variability in catchment/flow properties within themselves when compared to that of the whole network, thus indicating that such characteristics are unlikely to be a significant influence on community grouping. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:46:48","2018-01-20 00:46:48","","478-493","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United States; catchment; correlation; river flow; streamflow; Computer networks; Social sciences; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Watersheds; network analysis; Catchments; river basin; Classification (of information); Spatial correlations; Complex networks; Stream flow; Normalized mutual information; threshold; community structure; Mississippi River Basin; Catchment classifications; stemflow; Community structures; Correlation threshold; Geographic proximity; Level of consistencies; Mississippi Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on Gaussian aperture distributions and the assumption of local parallel plate model, a simple model was obtained in closed form to predict the capillary pressure-saturation relationships for both wetting and non-wetting phases. Three conceptual models were also developed to characterize the relative permeability behaviors. In order to investigate the effect of normal deformation on two-phase flow properties, the normal deformation could be represented with the maximum void space closure on the basis of penetration model. A rigorous successive random addition (SRA) method was used to generate the aperture-based fractures and a numerical approach based on invasion percolation (IP) model was employed to model capillary-dominated displacements between wetting and non-wetting phases. The proposed models were partially verified by a laboratory dataset and numerical calculations without consideration of deformation. Under large normal deformations, it was found that the macroscopic model is in better agreement with simulated observations. The simulation results demonstrated that the two-phase flow properties including the relationships between capillary pressure, relative permeability and saturation, phase interference, phase structures, residual-saturation-rated parameters and tortuosity factor, were highly sensitive to the spatial correlation of aperture distribution and normal deformation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:47:04","2018-01-20 00:47:04","","72-87","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","data set; numerical method; analytical method; conceptual framework; Numerical methods; Spatial correlations; laboratory method; percolation; Solvents; permeability; Fracture; Two phase flow; saturation; Capillarity; Capillary flow; capillary pressure; Capillary tubes; wetting; Wetting; Deformation; fracture flow; fracture aperture; fracture; two-dimensional flow; Relative permeability; Capillary pressure-saturation relationship; Aperture distribution; crustal deformation; Horizontal fractures; Numerical approaches; Numerical calculation; Rock fractures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) receives large amounts of precipitation in both summer (JJAS) and spring (MAM) and this makes it different from most other parts of the TP where annual precipitation concentrates only in summer. However, our knowledge of controls on precipitation and surface runoff generation in this region is still far from sufficient. In this study, the δ18O and δD of precipitation and stream waters across the southeastern TP were analyzed to investigate moisture sources and empirical isotope-elevation relationships. Herein, seasonal precipitation patterns, moisture trajectories and precipitation isotopes suggest this region is seasonally dominated by the monsoon in summer and the southerlies (from the Bay of Bengal) or a mix of southerlies and westerlies in spring. Spatially, vertical variations in precipitation seasonality exert profound influences on isotopic variability for stream waters. Larger contributions of spring precipitation (with higher δ18O and d-excess (d-excess = δD-8δ18O) compared to summer precipitation) vs. summer precipitation in the surface runoff generation at lower elevations account for the uncommon altitudinal decrease in streamwater d-excess. Such a cause also contributes to the slightly greater vertical lapse rates of streamwater δ18O (−0.28 to −0.48‰/100 m) relative to the Himalayan front. In addition, although a robust δ18O-elevation relationship is demonstrated based upon our measured and other published data on a broad spatial scale (over a 5200 m elevation range), this relationship is found to deviate from the empirical/theoretical pattern in the Himalayan front, which is also caused by the substantial spring precipitation in the southeastern TP. It is suggested that long-term changes in δ18O or δD of paleowater in this region actually represent both changes in past regional elevations and contributions of summer vs. spring atmospheric circulations. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 00:47:21","2018-01-20 00:47:21","","276-287","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Runoff; atmospheric circulation; moisture; summer; surface water; monsoon; seasonality; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; seasonal variation; Stream flow; Isotopes; stable isotope; India; Moisture; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean; Moisture sources; westerly; streamwater; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; isotopic analysis; oxygen isotope; precipitation (chemistry); spring (season); Tibetan Plateau; Stable isotopes; Indian summer monsoon; Spring precipitation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper provides indicative evidence and develops understanding of this novel phenomenon and associated policy needs within the Australian setting comprising dual hydrologic extremes of floods and droughts, further exacerbated by climate change. This is achieved through comparative case studies involving surveys of both dam owner perceptions and dam management practices in four States representing a complete range of integrated policy approaches from weak to strong. Survey results find most farmers do not believe dam maintenance is important, will undertake spillway blocking and do not plan for emergencies. These results are supported by physical on-site findings of farmers neglecting dams and blocking or under-designing spillways, in turn storing more water than they are entitled and creating unsafe dams at both the individual and cumulative levels. From detailed cross-case comparative assessment against policy context, it emerges that on-farm perceptions and practices form a range of ‘acceptability’ of dam management that directly reflects policy strength and integration in each setting. The paper advances the international small dams policy, agricultural water management and hydrology literatures, evidencing the need for effective integrated policy to mitigate dual extreme cumulative threats. Importantly, guidance is provided to jurisdictions internationally with high inter-annual rainfall variation on how best to design integrated policy that can achieve both water storage equity and safety in agricultural catchments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:47:38","2018-01-20 00:47:38","","55-71","","","545","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Climate change; Dams; Runoff; Water management; rainfall; water planning; climate change; water management; hydrological modeling; Agriculture; integrated approach; Management practices; Catchments; water storage; agricultural catchment; safety; Agricultural catchments; Surveys; Comparative assessment; dam; policy implementation; mitigation; Safety engineering; Dam safety; spillway; Spillways; Agricultural water management; Dual threats; Fair water sharing; Farm Dams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Ray catchment in the upper Thames basin, UK, was extensively monitored using in-situ, high-resolution (15 min) flow and water quality instrumentation. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, turbidity and specific conductivity are used to characterise the water quality dynamics. The impact of the Swindon sewage treatment works (SSTW) on water chemistry at the catchment outlet is considerable. Hydrological and water-quality response varies considerably during the events, with the rural catchments exhibiting a much slower hydrological response compared to urban areas. A simple hydrological model (TETIS) was developed to provide insight into water sources in nested subcatchments, highlighting the disparity of the hydrological dynamics across contrasting land-uses during events. The variation in stormwater runoff sources impacts water quality signals with urban sites contributing to dilution dynamics in ammonium, whereas the more rural site experiences a peak in ammonium during the same event. Dissolved oxygen concentrations vary on a rural-urban gradient and experience a notable sag at the Water Eaton outlet (4.4 mg/l) during the events, that would have resulted in significant ecological harm had they occurred during the summer in warmer temperatures. The water-quality legacy of these storms in the wider context of the hydrological year is somewhat negligible, with markedly poorer water quality signals being observed during the summer months of 2014. Although ammonium concentrations during the events are elevated (above the ‘good’ status threshold under the WFD), higher values are observed during spring and summer months. The high flows actually appear to flush contaminants out of the Ray and its subcatchments, though the urban sites demonstrate a resupply dynamic during interim dry periods. Data suggest winter storms following dry spells in urban catchments cause some short-lived and spatially extensive deteriorations in water quality. More chronic effects, although prolonged, are only seen downstream of SSTW. These are indicative of capacity of infrastructure being reached, and from the data do not appear to be severe enough to cause ecological harm. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:47:54","2018-01-20 00:47:54","","463-477","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; United Kingdom; Water quality; catchment; hydrology; water quality; Drought; Ecology; hydrological modeling; flooding; concentration (composition); Land use; runoff; seasonal variation; environmental monitoring; Catchments; urban area; Storms; Hydrology; extreme event; hydrological response; Storm sewers; Dynamics; Biochemical oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; Dissolved oxygen; Rural areas; Urban growth; England; water chemistry; Experimental catchments; Storm water runoff; ammonium; winter; Dissolved oxygen concentrations; Ammonium concentrations; High-resolution monitoring; rural-urban comparison; Rural-urban gradients; Sewage treatment; Sewage treatment works; Swindon [England]; Thames Basin; Water quality response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Comprehending and distinguishing the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff is essential to adapt water-resource management and soil-and-water conservation projects to climate change. In this study, we used a technique involving integrated climate elasticity and eight Budyko-based methods to assess the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes during high-flow and low-flow seasons in 17 catchments across the Loess Plateau during the period of 1961–2013. The results showed that, on average, runoff in the high-flow season exhibited a significant downward trend in 15/17 catchments, with an average decrease of 0.63 mm/yr. In contrast, the decrease was 0.29 mm/yr for the low-flow season. We also found that changes in runoff were more sensitive to variations in precipitation than variations in potential evapotranspiration, in both high-flow and low-flow seasons. The quantitative contributions from climate change and human activities as calculated by the eight Budyko-based methods were relatively similar during the high-flow season, but varied across catchments in the low-flow season. The results showed that, during the high-flow season, human activities had a greater impact on runoff changes than climate change, accounting for about 73% of the total decrease. However, in the low-flow season, which exhibits significantly increased potential evapotranspiration (p < 0.01) and decreased precipitation, the influence of climate change on runoff changes was greater than the influence of human activities.

Furthermore, water was sampled from springs located in the same geological environment. Based on the measurement of noble-gas concentrations and isotope ratios, tritium concentrations, the stable isotope composition of hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O), and the concentrations of major ions in the water, a conceptual hydrogeological model was established for this case study that allowed the most probable origin of the groundwaters sampled at different locations to be determined. The measured abundances of 3He, 4He, and 20Ne allow the geochemical characterization of old groundwaters strongly enriched in terrigenic helium of crustal origin and the identification of mixing with water that circulates preferentially through cataclastic structures.

However, there are limited recharge estimates in this region due to the complexity of recharge processes and the challenge of direct observations. Land surface Models (LSMs) could be a valuable tool for estimating current recharge and projecting changes due to future climate change. In this study, simulations of three LSMs (Noah, Mosaic and VIC) obtained from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) are used to estimate potential recharge in the western US. Modeled recharge was compared with published recharge estimates for several aquifers in the region. Annual recharge to precipitation ratios across the study basins varied from 0.01% to 15% for Mosaic, 3.2% to 42% for Noah, and 6.7% to 31.8% for VIC simulations. Mosaic consistently underestimates recharge across all basins. Noah captures recharge reasonably well in wetter basins, but overestimates it in drier basins. VIC slightly overestimates recharge in drier basins and slightly underestimates it for wetter basins. While the average annual recharge values vary among the models, the models were consistent in identifying high and low recharge areas in the region. Models agree in seasonality of recharge occurring dominantly during the spring across the region. Overall, our results highlight that LSMs have the potential to capture the spatial and temporal patterns as well as seasonality of recharge at large scales.

The primary focus of the paper was to develop a novel approach to quantify and optimize the prediction interval resulted from the non-stationarity of data set, which is reflected in the distribution parameters estimated, in FFA. This paper proposed the combination of the multi-objective optimization approach and the ensemble simulation technique to determine the optimal perturbations of distribution parameters for constructing the prediction interval of flood quantiles in FFA. To demonstrate the proposed approach, annual maximum daily flow data collected from two gauge stations on the Bow River, Alberta, Canada, were used.

A total of 12 rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in two 1 m by 2 m boxes under increased rainfall series (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm min−1) and decreased rainfall series (2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 mm min−1) on a typical slope gradient of 15°. Artificial tillage was the major contributing factor to the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography on sloping farmland of the purple soil area. Spatiotemporal variability of microtopography was expressed using semivariogram and multifractal spectrum, and spatial heterogeneity of drainage networks was expressed using general fractal dimension ΔD based on multifractal theory. In general, the drainage networks was mostly effected by microrelief. The drainage density of ridge tillage was smaller than that of the conservation tillage under different rainfall patterns, and the drainage density decreased remarkably with the increasing microrelief. Moreover, the ΔD values of ridge tillage ranged from 0.1817 to 0.5677. By contrast, the ΔD values of the conservation tillage ranged from 0.9662 to 1.3013, and thus the lower spatial heterogeneity of drainage networks in ridge tillage compared to conservation tillage. In this study, we established a novel method for analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of microtopography and demonstrated the effect of microtopography on the flow convergence of sloping farmland. These findings had important implications for clarifying the essence of microtopography of purple soil area and laying a theoretical basis and a support datum for harnessing measure of sloping farmland. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:49:34","2018-01-20 00:49:34","","88-99","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; GIS; Rain; rainfall; convergence; heterogeneity; Agriculture; spatiotemporal analysis; water flow; experimental study; drainage network; Geographic information systems; Soils; variogram; digital elevation model; microtopography; Surveying; Soil conservation; agricultural land; Farms; Drainage; Drainage networks; Agricultural machinery; Fractal dimension; Fractals; Micro topography; conservation tillage; Multifractal models; Ridge tillage; Semivariograms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, microwave observations in the frequency between 10 and 183 GHz are used for estimating rainfall based on the direct interaction of radiation with the hydrometeors within precipitating clouds in a so-called top-down approach. Recently, a bottom-up approach was proposed that uses satellite soil moisture products derived from microwave observations (<10 GHz) for the estimation of accumulated rainfall amounts. The integration of the bottom-up and top-down approaches has large potential for providing high accurate rainfall estimates exploiting their different and complementary nature. In this study, we perform a long-term (3 years) assessment of different satellite rainfall products exploiting the full range of microwave frequencies over Italy. Specifically, the integration of two top-down algorithms (CDRD, Cloud Dynamics and Radiation Database, and PNPR, Passive microwave Neural network Precipitation Retrieval) for estimating rainfall from conically and cross-track scanning radiometers, and one bottom-up algorithm (SM2RAIN) applied to the Advanced SCATterometer soil moisture product is carried out. The performances of the products, individually and merged together, are assessed at daily time scale. The integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches provides the highest performance both in terms of continuous and categorical scores (i.e., median correlation coefficient and root mean square error values equal to 0.71 and 6.62 mm, respectively). In such a combination, the limitations of the two approaches are compensated allowing a better estimation of ground accumulated rainfall through SM2RAIN while, overcoming the limitations of rainfall estimation for intense events during wet conditions through CDRD-PNPR product. The accuracy and the reliability of the merged product open new possibilities for their testing in hydrological applications, such as the monitoring and prediction of floods and droughts over large areas, including regions where ground-based measurements are sparse or not available. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:49:52","2018-01-20 00:49:52","","436-450","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Italy; Rain; algorithm; drought; prediction; rainfall; satellite data; soil moisture; remote sensing; software; Drought; Floods; natural hazard; Remote sensing; sensor; Precipitation (meteorology); Soil moisture; Soils; precipitation assessment; landslide; Mean square error; Root mean square errors; bottom-up approach; flood; Moisture; Satellite soil moisture; Meteorological instruments; hydrometry; ground-based measurement; Ground based measurement; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Precipitation retrievals; ASCAT; Accumulated rainfall; Bottom-up and top-down; Cross-track scanning; Microwave observations; top-down approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online NFMs adopt a local learning approach and are able to adapt to changes continuously. The DENFIS model however requires upper/lower bound for normalization and also the number of rules increases monotonically. This requirement makes the model unsuitable for use in basins with limited data, since a priori data is required. In order to address this and other drawbacks of current online models, the Generic Self-Evolving Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GSETSK) is adopted in this study for forecast applications in basins with limited data. GSETSK is a fully-online NFM which updates its structure and parameters based on the most recent data. The model does not require the need for historical data and adopts clustering and rule pruning techniques to generate a compact and up-to-date rule-base. GSETSK was used in two forecast applications, rainfall-runoff (a catchment in Sweden) and river routing (Lower Mekong River) forecasts. Each of these two applications was studied under two scenarios: (i) there is no prior data, and (ii) only limited data is available (1 year for the Swedish catchment and 1 season for the Mekong River). For the Swedish Basin, GSETSK model results were compared to available results from a calibrated HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) model. For the Mekong River, GSETSK results were compared against the URBS (Unified River Basin Simulator) model. Both comparisons showed that results from GSETSK are comparable with the physically based models, which were calibrated with historical data. Thus, even though GSETSK was trained with a very limited dataset in comparison with HBV or URBS, similar results were achieved. Similarly, further comparisons between GSETSK with DENFIS and the RBF (Radial Basis Function) models highlighted further advantages of GSETSK as having a rule-base (compared to opaque RBF) which is more compact, up-to-date and more easily interpretable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:50:08","2018-01-20 00:50:08","","424-435","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; Runoff; catchment; rainfall-runoff modeling; river flow; data set; Rivers; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; runoff; World Wide Web; Catchments; river basin; forecasting method; data acquisition; Sweden; Runoff forecasting; Hepatitis B virus; Image segmentation; Radial basis function networks; Mekong River; Evolving Takagi-Sugeno; Neuro-Fuzzy model; Online","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A trade-off exists between spatial coverage and temporal resolution when using the manual and real-time θ monitoring methods. This restricted the comprehensive and intensive examination of θ dynamics. In this study, we integrated the manual and real-time monitored data to depict the hillslope θ dynamics with good spatial coverage and temporal resolution. Linear (stepwise multiple linear regression-SMLR) and non-linear (support vector machines-SVM) models were used to predict θ at 39 manual sites (collected 1–2 times per month) with θ collected at three real-time monitoring sites (collected every 5 mins). By comparing the accuracies of SMLR and SVM for each depth and manual site, an optimal prediction model was then determined at this depth of this site. Results showed that θ at the 39 manual sites can be reliably predicted (root mean square errors &lt;0.028 m3 m−3) using both SMLR and SVM. The linear or non-linear relationship between θ at each manual site and at the three real-time monitoring sites was the main reason for choosing SMLR or SVM as the optimal prediction model. The subsurface flow dynamics was an important factor that determined whether the relationship was linear or non-linear. Depth to bedrock, elevation, topographic wetness index, profile curvature, and θ temporal stability influenced the selection of prediction model since they were related to the subsurface soil water distribution and movement. Using this approach, hillslope θ spatial distributions at un-sampled times and dates can be predicted.

Despite this extensive installation of check dams, their effects on runoff response are not well understood as compared to those of other SWC practices. Hence, this study examines the effects of check dams on runoff response in gully channels. 90 degree V-notch weirs were installed to measure a wide range of runoff discharges at the upper and lower sections of five gully reaches: two channel cut in sandstone (a gully with check dams and vegetation (SCV) and an untreated gully (S)) and three cut in limestone (an untreated gully (L), a gully with check dams but no vegetation (LC) and a gully with check dams and vegetation (LCV)). Automatic sensors were installed to monitor runoff depth during two rainy seasons (29/08/14 – 17/09/14 and 24/7/15 – 14/09/15). All runoff characteristics at the lower section of each gully reaches were calculated for a gully reaches length of 50 m. In the sandstone area, the results show longer lag times of runoff to reach the lower section of the channel reach in the treated gully (SCV) compared to the untreated gully: difference in time lag equal lag to production of runoff equals 51% for runoff initiation, 61% for peak runoff and 44% for runoff end. An increase of hydraulic roughness by check dams and water transmission losses in deposited sediments are responsible for the delay of runoff to reach the lower part of the gully channels. In the limestone area, different time lags were recorded in different gully reaches regardless of the treatment effects (lag to runoff initiation, lag to peak flow and lag to runoff end were larger at LC, L and LCV, respectively). The reduction of peak runoff discharge between the upper and lower gully sections was larger in the gullies with check dam and vegetation (8–17%) than in gullies without treatment (5–6%). Reduction of runoff volume between these 2 gully sections was also larger in treated gullies than in untreated gullies: i.e. 18%, 9% and 8% in SCV, LCV and LC, respectively while it was only 4% in S and 6% in L. This study shows that the implementation of check dams combined with vegetation reduced peak flow discharge and runoff volume as large sections of runoff infiltrated in the sediments deposited behind the check dams. As gully check dams are implemented in a large areas of the North Ethiopia Highlands, this contributes to groundwater recharge and increased river base flow. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:51:11","2018-01-20 00:51:11","","299-309","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Dams; Runoff; Vegetation; discharge; groundwater; river flow; Ethiopia; Groundwater flow; Groundwater; runoff; sensor; Water conservation; river basin; Landforms; Soil conservation; recharge; dam construction; river channel; peak flow; Runoff volumes; Limestone; Sandstone; dam; limestone; sandstone; Tekeze River; installation; gully; Gully controls; Lag-time; Runoff discharge; Strawberry crinkle virus; Tekeze basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particular importance was attached to human activities, such as population density and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and also water reservoirs in terms of their relationship with streamflow changes. Results indicated that: (1) streamflow changes of river basins in northern China were more sensitive to climate change than those of river basins in southern China. Based on the degree of sensitivity, the influencing factors to which streamflow changes are sensitive included: precipitation > human activities > relative humidity > solar radiation > maximum temperature > wind speed > minimum temperature. Hence, it can be argued that hydrological systems in northern China are more fragile and more sensitive to changing environment than those in southern China and hence water resources management in northern China is more challenging; (2) during 1980–2000, climate change tended to increase streamflow changes across China and have a dominant role in streamflow variation. However, climate change tends to decrease streamflow in river basins of northern China. Generally, human activities cause a decrease of streamflow across China; (3) In recent years such as a period of 2001–2014, human activities tend to have increasing or enhancing impacts on instream flow changes, and fractional contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes are, respectively, 53.5% and 46.5%.

In subarctic Québec (Nunavik), they have grown in number and size since the mid-20th century. Recent studies have identified that these lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases. This is mainly due to the supply of catchment-derived dissolved organic carbon that generates anoxic conditions leading to methane production. To assess the potential role of climate-driven changes in hydrological processes to influence greenhouse-gas emissions, we utilized water isotope tracers to characterize the water balance of thermokarst lakes in Nunavik during three consecutive mid- to late summer sampling campaigns (2012–2014). Lake distribution stretches from shrub-tundra overlying discontinuous permafrost in the north to spruce-lichen woodland with sporadic permafrost in the south. Calculation of lake-specific input water isotope compositions (δI) and lake-specific evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios based on an isotope-mass balance model reveal a narrow hydrological gradient regardless of diversity in regional landscape characteristics. Nearly all lakes sampled were predominantly fed by rainfall and/or permafrost meltwater, which suppressed the effects of evaporative loss. Only a few lakes in one of the southern sampling locations, which overly highly degraded sporadic permafrost terrain, appear to be susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown. We attribute this lake hydrological resiliency to the strong maritime climate in coastal regions of Nunavik. Predicted climate-driven increases in precipitation and permafrost degradation will likely contribute to persistence and expansion of thermokarst lakes throughout the region. If coupled with an increase in terrestrial carbon inputs to thermokarst lakes from surface runoff, conditions favorable for mineralization and emission of methane, these water bodies may become even more important sources of greenhouse gases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:51:45","2018-01-20 00:51:45","","327-338","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","rainfall; Water balance; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; runoff; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Catchments; Water levels; Lakes; Organic carbon; water budget; Isotopes; tracer; isotopic composition; dissolved organic carbon; lacustrine environment; permafrost; Permafrost; evergreen tree; hydrogen isotope; anoxic conditions; lake level; meltwater; twentieth century; thermokarst; Thermokarst lakes; methane; Methane; Water isotope; subarctic region; lichen; Maritime climate; Nunavik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To determine comprehensive groundwater recharge processes in a catchment with large seasonal hydrological variations, intensive field surveys were conducted in the Wangkuai Reservoir watershed located in the Taihang Mountains, North China, during three different times of the year: beginning of the rainy season (June 2011), mid-rainy season (August 2012), and dry season (November 2012). Oxygen and hydrogen isotope and chemical analyses were conducted on the groundwater, spring water, stream water, and reservoir water of the Wangkuai Reservoir watershed. The results were processed using endmember mixing analysis to determine the amount of contribution of the groundwater recharging processes. Similar isotopic and chemical signatures between the surface water and groundwater in the target area indicate that the surface water in the mountain–plain transitional area and the Wangkuai Reservoir are the principal groundwater recharge sources, which result from the highly permeable geological structure of the target area and perennial large-scale surface water, respectively. Additionally, the widespread and significant effect of the diffuse groundwater recharge on the Wangkuai Reservoir was confirmed with the deuterium (d) excess indicator and the high contribution throughout the year, calculated using endmember mixing analysis. Conversely, the contribution of the stream water to the groundwater recharge in the mountain–plain transitional area clearly decreases from the beginning of the rainy season to the mid-rainy season, whereas that of the precipitation increases. This suggests that the main groundwater recharge source shifts from stream water to episodic/continuous heavy precipitation in the mid-rainy season. In other words, the surface water and precipitation commonly affect the groundwater recharge in the rainy season, whereas the reservoir and stream water play important roles in the groundwater recharge in the low-precipitation period. The results should contribute not only to the understanding of the mountain hydrology but also to groundwater resource management in the North China Plain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:52:20","2018-01-20 00:52:20","","132-144","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Water management; streamflow; surface water; Rivers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; watershed; spatiotemporal analysis; Watersheds; Catchments; Landforms; Surface waters; precipitation assessment; Chemical analysis; Reservoirs (water); Ground water recharge; recharge; Mixing; Isotopes; tracer; groundwater resource; Recharging (underground waters); geological structure; Hydrochemistry; Multi-tracer approach; deuterium; North China Plain; permeability; Hebei; Underground reservoirs; End-member mixing analysis; Low-precipitation region; Taihang Mountains; Wangkuai Reservoir","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, two different input selection methods were used: cross-correlation analysis (CCA), and a combination of mutual information and cross-correlation analyses (MICCA). Selected inputs were used to develop adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in Sungai Kayu Ara basin, Selangor, Malaysia. The study catchment has 10 rainfall stations and one discharge station located at the outlet of the catchment. A total of 24 rainfall-runoff events (10-min interval) from 1996 to 2004 were selected from which 18 events were used for training and the remaining 6 were reserved for validating (testing) the models. The results of ANFIS models then were compared against the ones obtained by conceptual model HEC-HMS. The CCA and MICCA methods selected the rainfall inputs only from 2 (stations 1 and 5) and 3 (stations 1, 3, and 5) rainfall stations, respectively. ANFIS model developed based on MICCA inputs (ANFIS-MICCA) performed slightly better than the one developed based on CCA inputs (ANFIS-CCA). ANFIS-CCA and ANFIS-MICCA were able to perform comparably to HEC-HMS model where rainfall data of all 10 stations had been used; however, in peak estimation, ANFIS-MICCA was the best model. The sensitivity analysis on HEC-HMS was conducted by recalibrating the model by using the same selected rainfall stations for ANFIS. It was concluded that HEC-HMS model performance deteriorates if the number of rainfall stations reduces. In general, ANFIS was found to be a reliable alternative for HEC-HMS in cases whereby not all rainfall stations are functioning. This study showed that the selected stations have received the highest total rain and rainfall intensity (stations 3 and 5). Moreover, the contributing rainfall stations selected by CCA and MICCA were found to be located near the outlet of contributing sub-catchments. This provides valuable information towards identifying the more contributing sub-catchments in catchments such as Sungai Kayu Ara where no flow measurement is available for sub-catchments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:52:37","2018-01-20 00:52:37","","100-108","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; catchment; discharge; performance assessment; rainfall-runoff modeling; sensitivity analysis; ANFIS; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; mapping method; Catchments; Precipitation (meteorology); flow measurement; Rainfall-runoff modeling; precipitation intensity; Correlation methods; Rainfall-runoff events; Malaysia; West Malaysia; Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; Input selection; Cross-correlation analysis; Ara; HEC-HMS; Input selection method; Selangor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Undoubtedly, exploring connectivity of granular materials is essential to understand the mechanism of water and contaminant migration in subsurface environment, while characterizing the connectivity remains a difficult task currently. This study proposes a new light transmission micro-tomography (LTM) with high resolution to address this problem. The new approach relies on scanning micro-structure by light transmission through translucent granular materials in given thickness. An experiment of light transmission through a two dimensional (2D) sandbox packed by heterogeneous translucent silica is conducted to examine the efficiency of LTM in capturing all the features of connectivity including porosity (n), density (ρ), solid phase-pores interface area (Asp), and tortuosity (τ). Considering the importance of representative elementary volume (REV) in characterizing the representativeness and reliability of connectivity, associated REV scales of characteristic variables are also estimated using a criterion of relative gradient error (εg i). Results suggest that the frequencies of minimum REV sizes of connectivity are close to Gaussian distribution in 0.0–12.0 mm and the REV size of approximately 10.0 mm is available to represent connectivity of translucent silica. Then the quantification of connectivity and the corresponding REV estimates are significant for accurate simulation of fluid migration and for associated optimal design of contaminant remediation in subsurface environment. More important, this study provides the possibility of rapid, handy and economical on-site measurements of connectivity for translucent materials. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:52:54","2018-01-20 00:52:54","","12-27","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","connectivity; Hydrogeology; heterogeneity; two-dimensional modeling; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; experimental study; groundwater flow; Gaussian method; subsurface flow; quantitative analysis; Connectivity; groundwater resource; tomography; tortuosity; Tomography; Granular materials; Light transmission; Representative elementary volume; Subsurface environment; Silica; microstructure; Microstructure; Two Dimensional (2 D); transmissivity; Contaminant migration; Contaminant remediation; granular medium; Micro-tomography; Translucent materials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, little is known about the various components of evapotranspiration in these possibly vigorously regenerating forests. This paper reports on a comparison of measured and modeled canopy interception losses (I) from a semi-mature (ca. 20 years) and a young (5–7 years) secondary forest in the lower montane rain forest zone of eastern Madagascar. Measurements of gross rainfall (P), throughfall (Tf), and stemflow (Sf) were made in both forests for one year (October 2014–September 2015) and the revised analytical model of Gash et al. (1995) was tested for the first time in a tropical secondary forest setting. Overall measured Tf, Sf and derived I in the semi-mature forest were 71.0%, 1.7% and 27.3% of incident P, respectively. Corresponding values for the young forest were 75.8%, 6.2% and 18.0%. The high Sf for the young forest reflects the strongly upward thrusting habit of the branches of the dominant species (Psiadia altissima), which favours funneling of P. The value of I for the semi-mature forest is similar to values reported for old-growth tropical lower montane rain forests elsewhere but I for the younger forest is higher than reported for similarly aged tropical lowland forests. These findings can be explained largely by the prevailing low rainfall intensities and the frequent occurrence of small rainfall events. The revised analytical model was able to reproduce measured cumulative I at the two sites accurately and succeeded in capturing the variability in I associated with the seasonal variability in rainfall intensity, provided that Tf-based values for the average wet-canopy evaporation rates were used instead of values derived with the Penman-Monteith equation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:53:11","2018-01-20 00:53:11","","212-225","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Evapotranspiration; Rain; evapotranspiration; rainfall; tropical forest; spatiotemporal analysis; analytical method; Forestry; regeneration; Reforestation; Madagascar; precipitation intensity; interception; Tropics; rainforest; upland region; stemflow; Forest regeneration; secondary forest; throughfall; Analytical models; age class; Interception models; old-growth forest; Psiadia; Secondary tropical forests; Stemflow; Throughfall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We test the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to estimate transient hydraulic heads and groundwater recharge, as well as the hydraulic conductivity and specific-yield distributions of a virtual phreatic aquifer. To speed up computation time, we use a coarsened spatial grid in the filter simulations, and reconstruct head measurements at observation points by a local model in the vicinity of the piezometer as part of the observation operator. We show that the EnKF can adequately estimate both the mean and spatial patterns of hydraulic conductivity when assimilating daily values of hydraulic heads from a highly variable initial sample. The filter can also estimate temporally variable recharge to a satisfactory level, as long as the ensemble size is large enough. Constraining the parameters on concentrations of groundwater-age tracers (here: tritium) and transient hydraulic-head observations cannot reasonably be done by the EnKF because the concentrations depend on the recharge history over longer times while the head observations have much shorter temporal support. We thus use a different method, the Kalman Ensemble Generator (KEG), to precondition the initial ensemble of the EnKF on the groundwater-age tracer data and time-averaged hydraulic-head values. The preconditioned initial ensemble exhibits a smaller spread as well as improved means and spatial patterns. The preconditioning improves the EnKF particularly for smaller ensemble sizes, allowing operational data assimilation with reduced computational effort. In a validation scenario of delineating groundwater protection zones, the preconditioned filter performs clearly better than the filter using the original initial ensemble. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:53:28","2018-01-20 00:53:28","","42-54","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; environmental factor; Groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; Bandpass filters; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; water resource; spatiotemporal analysis; groundwater flow; resource management; Kalman filter; Ground water recharge; hydraulic conductivity; recharge; tracer; Recharging (underground waters); water yield; observational method; piezometer; Kalman filters; Hydraulic heads; Groundwater ages; Hydraulic conductivity; phreatic zone; hydraulic head; Boreholes; Specific yield; Electric equipment protection; Kalman ensemble generator; Phreatic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, we studied three caves at different altitudes (74 m, 570 m and 1250 m a.s.l.) along a transect from the Dalmatian islands to Velebit Mountain peaks in coastal Croatia to characterize their environments in terms of each cave's suitability to host speleothems that would be capable of yielding robust paleoclimate reconstructions. We conducted cave microclimate (2-years) and dripwater (1-year) monitoring and analysed the isotopic composition of precipitation, cave dripwater and modern spelean calcite. As for the water isotopic imprints, the isotopic values of meteoric waters reaching the two lower-altitude caves, in spite of an altitude difference of 500 m, lie on local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) of similar slope and intercept (δ2H = 6.61 × δ18O + 4.92 and δ2H = 6.69 × δ18O + 6.86). Their slopes lower than that of GMWL indicate enhanced evaporation during the warm season. As expected, the LMWL of the highest cave region (δ2H = 7.83 × δ18O + 14.45) resembles the slope of the GMWL, but the values of deuterium excess obtained for all three caves (between 15.2‰ and 16.6‰) match that of western Mediterranean-sourced waters (∼15‰). Monthly d-excess values suggest Atlantic-sourced air masses can reach the sites throughout the year but never dominate the rainfall composition. The altitude effect was noted both in precipitation and in dripwater isotopic composition, but with notably different Δδ18O/100 m gradients (−0.33‰ and −0.11‰, respectively). Stable isotope variations of the dripwaters in all caves were attenuated in relation to the rainwater, even those of the drip sites with fracture-flow behaviour. Based on stable cave microclimate conditions, relatively steady discharges, and modern calcite apparently precipitated at or close to isotopic equilibrium with dripwater, the two caves at lower altitudes show the greatest potential for future paleoclimate studies. The cave at the highest altitude experiences large cave air temperature amplitudes (5.3 °C) and pronounced ventilation, making the isotopic signal susceptible to kinetic fractionation which might preclude quantification of environmental changes, but on the other hand it accentuates isotopic events, making them easier to identify. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:54:01","2018-01-20 00:54:01","","367-380","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","hydrology; paleoclimate; reconstruction; karst hydrology; environmental monitoring; equilibrium; air temperature; Isotopes; isotopic fractionation; isotopic composition; Alps; cave; Caves; meteoric water; isotopic analysis; Water piping systems; Calcite; Repair; Stable isotopes; Karst; Adriatic Coast [Croatia]; Croatia; Dinaric Alps; Eastern Alps; Implications for futures; Isotopic characterization; Microclimate conditions; Paleo-environment; Paleoclimate reconstruction; speleothem; Velebit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides, the HEC-RAS resulting peak flow was compared to the ones obtained with the 2D model Iber and with Manning's equation; all three methods gave similar peak flows.

Observational data at various stages cannot be collected simultaneously. It may take a considerable amount of time and a great deal of difficulty to collect the data required for establishing the rating curves. The main purpose of the current paper is to estimate the discharge using the concept of isovel contours with the corresponding hydro-geometric parameters of the cross sections which was first introduced by Maghrebi (2006). Although the accuracy of the contours is not very high, it is believed that when the sum of the whole cross sectional contour values is used as a single parameter in the proposed relationship the accuracy of discharge estimation is surprisingly high. A relationship based on dimensional analysis is used to interrelate the discharges at two different stages by simply using the geometrical parameters such the cross-sectional area, wetted perimeter, the width of the free surface and a quantity which is related to the summations of isovel contours. Then, the most accurate relationship that is obtained by minimization of the differences between the calculated and analytical discharges at two different stages is introduced. For verification, the results of the proposed method are compared with the observed stage-discharge data taken from the Main and Severn rivers in UK, the Tomebamba River in Ecuador and the Yangtze River in China.

This paper examines the combined effects of watershed complexity on nitrate concentration and flux in terms of the hydrological and environmental factors in heterogeneous nested subwatersheds in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), China. We established 15 sampling sites in the main stream and tributaries and conducted biweekly sampling in 2008–2012 to monitor the nitrate exports. The hydrological and environmental indices within the watershed were divided into subwatersheds and considered as potential influencing factors. In consideration of the high co-linearity of these influencing factors, we used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine the associations between the stream nitrate concentration or flux and 26 selected watershed characteristics. The number of components was unequal for the nitrate concentration and flux models. The optimal models explained 66.4%, 60.0% and 59.9% of the variability in nitrate concentration and 74.7%, 67.1% and 58.0% of the variability in nitrate flux annually, in the dry season, and in the wet season, respectively. According to the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values, the dominant first-order factors for the nitrate concentration were as follows: the areal percentages of agricultural, forest and residential areas; followed by the slope; the largest patch index (LPI); the flow path gradient (FPG); the slope gradient variance (SGV); and the splitting index (SPLIT). In addition to these factors, the runoff coefficient (RC), flashiness index (FI), and patch density (PD) affected the changes in the nitrate flux.

To address this concern, this study applied three methods to analyze non-stationarity in hydrologic conditions. Based on the principle of identifying distribution and trends (IDT) with time-varying moments, we employed the parametric weighted least squares (WLS) estimation in conjunction with the non-parametric discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Our aim was to evaluate the applicability of non-parameter approaches, compared with traditional parameter-based methods. In contrast to most previous studies, which analyzed the non-stationarity of first moments, we incorporated second-moment analysis. Through the estimation of long-term risk, we were able to examine the behavior of return periods under two different definitions: the reciprocal of the exceedance probability of occurrence and the expected recurrence time. The proposed framework represents an improvement over stationary frequency analysis for the design of hydraulic systems. A case study was performed using precipitation data from major climate stations in Taiwan to evaluate the non-stationarity of annual maximum daily precipitation. The results demonstrate the applicability of these three methods in the identification of non-stationarity. For most cases, no significant differences were observed with regard to the trends identified using WLS, DWT, and EEMD. According to the results, a linear model should be able to capture time-variance in either the first or second moment while parabolic trends should be used with caution due to their characteristic rapid increases. It is also observed that local variations in precipitation tend to be overemphasized by DWT and EEMD. The two definitions provided for the concept of return period allows for ambiguous interpretation. With the consideration of non-stationarity, the return period is relatively small under the definition of expected recurrence time comparing to the estimation using the reciprocal of the exceedance probability of occurrence. However, the calculation of expected recurrence time is based on the assumption of perfect knowledge of long-term risk, which involves high uncertainty. When the risk is decreasing with time, the expected recurrence time will lead to the divergence of return period and make this definition inapplicable for engineering purposes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:55:09","2018-01-20 00:55:09","","197-211","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Return periods; Wavelet transforms; wavelet analysis; Non-stationarities; trend analysis; Risk perception; probability; parameterization; comparative study; uncertainty analysis; precipitation (climatology); ensemble forecasting; return period; probability density function; least squares method; Discrete wavelet transforms; Taiwan; Wavelet analysis; Weighted least squares; Hydrologic frequency analysis; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); discrete element method; decomposition; Wavelet decomposition; Discrete wavelet analysis; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Hydraulic equipment; Non-parameter approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have shown that precipitation and temperature data from reanalysis present a strong potential for hydrological modelling, especially in regions with a sparse observational network. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the combination of three global atmospheric reanalyses – ERA-Interim, CFSR and MERRA – and one gridded observation dataset on the accuracy of hydrological model discharge simulations. Two combination approaches were used. The first one combined reanalyses and the observational database using a weighted average of the precipitation and temperature inputs. The second one consisted in using all meteorological inputs separately and combining the simulated hydrographs. The combinations were performed over 460 Canadian watersheds (representing regions with a low density of weather stations) and 370 US watersheds (representing regions with a higher density of weather stations). Results showed significant improvements in the simulated discharges for 68% and 92% of the Canadian watersheds for the input combinations and output combinations, respectively. Moreover, both approaches led to significant improvements in the simulated discharges for 72% of the US watersheds studied. For all watersheds where simulated discharges using observational data had a Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) lower than 0.5, the combination with reanalyses resulted in a median NSE increase of 0.3. This indicates that reanalysis can successfully compensate for deficiencies in the surface observation record and provide significantly better hydrological modelling performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:55:27","2018-01-20 00:55:27","","120-131","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Calibration; performance assessment; rainfall-runoff modeling; river discharge; data assimilation; hydrological modeling; Meteorology; watershed; calibration; Watersheds; Canada; accuracy assessment; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological modelling; precipitation (climatology); Stream flow; observational method; temperate forest; Simulated discharges; Weather information services; weather station; Combination approaches; Data combination; Discharge simulations; Observations; Reanalyses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hydropower is built to improve the regional energy supply, but at the same time, it has considerable transboundary impacts on downstream discharge regime and further on aquatic ecosystems, riparian livelihoods and food security. Despite the transboundary significance of the impacts, there is no public information on the hydropower operations or on the already observed downstream discharge impacts since the completion of the largest dams. Therefore, in this study we assess the discharge changes using observed river discharge data and a distributed hydrological model over the period of 1960–2014. Our findings indicate that the hydropower operations have considerably modified the river discharges since 2011 and the largest changes were observed in 2014. According to observed and simulated discharges, the most notable changes occurred in northern Thailand (Chiang Saen) in March-May 2014 when the discharge increased by 121–187% and in July-August 2014 when the discharge decreased by 32–46% compared to average discharges. The respective changes in Cambodia (Kratie) were 41–74% increase in March-May 2014 and 0–6% decrease in July-August 2014 discharges. The earlier model-based predictions of the discharge changes are well in line with the observed changes, although observed changes are partly larger. The discharge impacts are expected to vary from year to year depending on hydropower operations. Altogether, the results highlight the need for strong transboundary cooperation for managing the downstream impacts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:55:59","2018-01-20 00:55:59","","28-41","","","545","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","river discharge; Rivers; hydrological modeling; Food supply; Aquatic ecosystems; food security; Hydrology; Hydrological modelling; environmental impact assessment; Thailand; flood; hydroelectric power; hydrological regime; Discharge (fluid mechanics); dam; Hydroelectric power; Hydropower; Hydroelectric power plants; Trans-boundary; transboundary cooperation; Chiang Rai; Chiang Saen; Mekong Basin; Northern Region [Thailand]; Cambodia; Flood pulse; Mekong River; Kracheh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation. This study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging: in data-sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates, while in data-dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge. The uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall, the chloride exported in runoff, the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling. This study focused on the coal bearing Sydney, Gunnedah, Gloucester and Surat Basins of Eastern New South Wales (Australia). Historically, groundwater recharge to the Permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water. The increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance. We found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers (up to 20% of long-term mean annual rainfall) and lowest in the Permian units (∼1% of long-term mean annual rainfall). The magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate. The method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty. The method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data. © 2017.","2017","2018-01-20 00:56:34","2018-01-20 00:56:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Regression analysis; Water resources; Hydrogeology; Uncertainty analysis; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Information management; Stochastic systems; Interpolation; Spatial analysis; Upscaling; Recharging (underground waters); Chlorine compounds; Sydney basins; Coal deposits; Gloucester; Gunnedah Basin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present a new method, slackwater flow depth, to assess palaeoflood peak stage and to reduce the underestimation of palaeoflood stage. Palaeoflood slackwater deposits (SWDs) were identified by palaeohydrological criteria in cliff riverbank on the Yanhe River, middle Yellow River basin. Palaeoflood events recorded in four layers of SWD were dated by optical stimulated luminescence to 9.5–8.5 ka. The estimation of palaeoflood maximum stage was 778.3 m using the slackwater flow depth method and the palaeoflood peak discharge is 15,000 m3/s using the step-backwater method. Palaeoflood results greatly extend the current flood data series in the Yanhe River basin. The regional flood history including gauged flood, historical and palaeoflood data was compiled and evaluated for the major tributaries of the middle Yellow River. The relationship between palaeoflood peak discharges and drainage areas in this region fit well with the global maximum curves. The results of site-specific and regional palaeoflood evaluations demonstrate that the approach estimates the true palaeoflood peak stage and discharges and improves the flood frequency analysis of extreme and rare floods for a particular basin. Meanwhile, the advantages and uncertainties of this method need ongoing discussion in palaeoflood investigations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:56:42","2018-01-20 00:56:42","","156-171","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Flood frequency analysis; Rivers; Floods; Flood control; Watersheds; Hydrology; Deposits; Yellow River basin; Flow depth; Palaeoflood hydrology; Stimulated luminescence; Yanhe River; Yellow river","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatial patterns of SWC can be characterized using temporal stability analysis of difficult-to-obtain data from high spatial density and temporal frequency. Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements with high spatial density have been widely used to infer the spatial variability of SWC. The objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that temporal stability of ECa can be demonstrated and that relationships between temporal stability characteristics of SWC and ECa can be established. Apparent electrical conductivity and topsoil gravimetric SWC (θ) were periodically measured in an olive orchard in southwest Spain on 6 and 18 occasions, respectively. A temporal stability analysis of ECa elucidated three zones where ECa was close to, consistently substantially smaller than, and substantially larger than the spatial average ECa throughout the study period. Representative locations for θ were found with a chance of 75% within the representative zone for ECa. Yet, the driest locations, with consistently smaller θ than the field average (θ), could be successfully identified (89%) within the zone with consistently smaller ECa than average. The θ − (θ) relations showed generally a linear behaviour, although a better fit was obtained at the highest θ using either exponential or power law equations at half of the locations. The former provided the best fit within the zone with ECa consistently smaller than average, while the latter performed best in the zone with ECa consistently larger than average. The linear equation provided the best fit within the representative ECa zone. This study demonstrates that temporal stability characteristics of ECa and SWC are linked and that ECa surveys can be used to delimit zones with representative locations for SWC measurement or estimation.

As such, its municipal water abstraction - often defined as direct water use - has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day (l/cap/d) in 2005 to 326 l/cap/d in 2013. Due to its political history, Hong Kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption. It is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use. The objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of Hong Kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use. The current average diet in Hong Kong is very different to the average Chinese diet. It is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar, leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint (WFcons) of 4727 l/cap/d. According to recommendations from the Chinese Nutrition Society for a healthy diet, the intake of some product groups should be increased (vegetables and fruit) and of other product groups reduced (sugar, crop oils, meat and animal fats). This would result in a reduction of the WFcons of 40% to 2852 l/cap/d. Especially the reduced intake of meat (including offals) from currently 126 kg per capita per year (kg/cap/yr) to the recommended value 27 kg/cap/yrwould results in a substantial WFcons reduction. Meat consumption in Hong Kong is extremely high. A pesco-vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49% (to 2398 l/cap/d) and a vegetarian diet in a 53% (to 2224 l/cap/d) reduction. Hong Kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet. Many of the products consumed, contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin Hong Kong imports from. This poses a water-related risk to food security in Hong Kong. As all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue WFcons, they decrease this risk. In order to become sustainable, (mega)cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems. © 2017 The Author(s).","2017","2018-01-20 00:57:08","2018-01-20 00:57:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Animals; Water consumption; Risk perception; Food supply; Water supply systems; Water supply; Vegetables and fruits; Data availability; Food consumption; Meat consumption; Nutrition; Oils and fats; Political history; Recommended values; Urban water supply system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact on groundwater resources, particularly in areas of fractured bedrock aquifer systems, requires knowledge of how recharge is affected. In this study, the response of a fractured bedrock aquifer to heavy rainfall events is characterized. The study area is the Gulf Islands, a temperate region in British Columbia, Canada. Of the 14 provincial observation wells with hourly groundwater level data, only three showed pronounced responses to heavy rain events and were analyzed in detail. A detailed analysis at one well suggests rises in groundwater level were better correlated to all rain events than exclusively heavy rain during summer. The strength of the correlation decreased as the rainfall intensity increased. Solution of the Green-Ampt equation for rainfall events of varying magnitude indicated that an increase in rainfall intensity leads to more surface ponding and overland flow. Thus, the occurrence of more frequent heavy rain events in the future may result in lower net recharge. Thermal infrared images in seepage areas and the δ18O and δ2H composition for precipitation and seepage suggest rapid seepage responses to heavy rain events and rapid seepage dissipation rates. The overall rapid response of the fractured bedrock was advantageous for studying the response of the system to heavy rain events. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:57:16","2018-01-20 00:57:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Rain; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Precipitation (meteorology); Ground water recharge; Recharging (underground waters); Infrared radiation; Seepage; Fractured rock; Stable isotopes of water; Infrared imaging; Groundwater seepage; Heavy rainfall; Thermal infrared imagery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in situ data in this region are extremely scarce and only a few lakes have gauge measurements. Satellite altimetry has been used successfully to monitor lake levels. In this study, Cryosat-2 SARIn mode data over the period 2010–2015 are used to investigate recent lake level variations. The estimated water levels of the 70 largest lakes (&gt; 100 km2) on the TP show that 48 lakes reveal a rising trend (avg. 0.28 ± 0.06 m/yr) while the other 22 show a slightly decreasing trend (avg. −0.10 ± 0.04 m/yr). To compare with the change rates during 2003–2009, ICESat data which cover 42 of the 70 lakes are also used. When combining the data, the results show that during the period of 2003–2015, 28 lakes maintained a rising trend and the change rates are comparable. Lakes in the northern part of the TP experienced pronounced rising (avg. 0.37 ± 0.10 m/yr), while lakes in southern part were steady or decreasing even in glaciated basins with high precipitation.

These results demonstrate that lakes on the TP are still rapidly changing under climate change, especially in northern part of the TP, but the driving factors are variable and more research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind observed changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:57:24","2018-01-20 00:57:24","","109-124","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Climate change; Water resources; gauge; temperature; trend analysis; climate change; Lake levels; spatiotemporal analysis; environmental monitoring; Water levels; Lakes; synthetic aperture radar; water level; precipitation (climatology); satellite altimetry; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; lake level; Tibetan Plateau; Altimetry; Cryosat; CryoSat; ICESat; SARIn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Models for managing water resources are important in Florida where population increase is escalating demand on water resources and infrastructure. The Suwannee River is the second largest river system in Florida and the least impacted by anthropogenic disturbance. We used new and existing tree-ring chronologies from multiple species to reconstruct mean March–October discharge for the Suwannee River during the period 1550–2005 CE and place the short period of instrumental flows (since 1927 CE) into historical context. We used a nested principal components regression method to maximize the use of chronologies with varying time coverage in the network. Modeled streamflow estimates indicated that instrumental period flow conditions do not adequately capture the full range of Suwannee River flow variability beyond the observational period. Although extreme dry and wet events occurred in the gage record, pluvials and droughts that eclipse the intensity and duration of instrumental events occurred during the 16–19th centuries. The most prolonged and severe dry conditions during the past 450 years occurred during the 1560s CE. In this prolonged drought period mean flow was estimated at 17% of the mean instrumental period flow. Significant peaks in spectral density at 2–7, 10, 45, and 85-year periodicities indicated the important influence of coupled oceanic-atmospheric processes on Suwannee River streamflow over the past four centuries, though the strength of these periodicities varied over time. Future water planning based on current flow expectations could prove devastating to natural and human systems if a prolonged and severe drought mirroring the 16th and 18th century events occurred.

Thus the evaluation of average aquifer recharge from precipitation, and its uncertainty, becomes a key subject in determining suitable countrywide water policies. The confident prediction of renewable groundwater resources requires an accurate evaluation of aquifer recharge over time and space, especially in large territories with varied conditions for aquifer recharge such as continental Spain. This study asses impacts of future potential climatic change scenarios on distributed net aquifer recharge (NAR) from precipitation over continental Spain. For this, the used method (1) generates future time series of climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) spatially distributed over the territory for potential aquifer recharge (PAR), and (2) simulates them within previously calibrated spatial PAR or NAR recharge models from the available historical information to provide distributed PAR or NAR time series. The information employed comes from the Spain02 project for the historical climatic data, from for the historical spatial NAR, and from the regional climate models (RCMs) simulations for the future climate scenarios. A distributed empirical precipitation-recharge model is defined by using a regular 10. km. ×. 10. km grid, and assuming that precipitation (P) and temperature (T) are the most important climatic variables determining PAR, while their spatiotemporal variabilities determine the impacts of future potential climatic scenarios on renewable groundwater resources. Potential plausible pictures of future climate scenarios are defined by combining information coming from different RCMs and General Circulation models (GCMs), downscaling techniques, and ensemble hypothesis. These scenarios were simulated within the used precipitation-recharge model to estimate impacts on NAR. The results show that global mean NAR decreases by 12% on average over continental Spain. Over 99.8% of the territory, a variable degree of recharge reduction is obtained; the reduction is quite heterogeneously distributed in line with the variety of conditions for aquifer recharge over continental Spain. The standard deviation of annual mean NAR will increase by 8% on average in the future. The dependence of these changes regarding potential explanatory variables, such as elevation and latitude was also analysed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:57:50","2018-01-20 00:57:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Climate change scenarios; Time series; Water management; Climate models; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Spatiotemporal variability; Regional climate models; General circulation model; Recharging (underground waters); Hydrological impacts; Future climate scenarios; Aquifer recharge; Continental Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owing to the high density of buildings and populations, constructing new storage tanks in urban areas is getting more and more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Inter Catchment Wastewater Transfer (ICWT) method for sewer overflow mitigation. The ICWT method aims at redistributing the spatial mismatched sewer flow according to the treatment capacity of Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Three tasks are involved in the development of ICWT. First, test the effectiveness of ICWT. Second, study how to properly redistribute inflow to the WWTP. Third, the operation of ICWT highly depends on inflow to the WWTP, to support the management of ICWT, it is imperative to construct a flow rate prediction model. A hydraulic model is used for task 1 and 2, individual and combined effects of the storage tank and ICWT on sewer overflow are investigated. The simulation results show that less overflow is obtained. In considering the deficiencies of hydraulic model, one of the most promising deep learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is employed to undertake task 3.

Additional sampling was also conducted within the Turkey Lakes watershed (47.03°N, 84.38°W), a research basin situated in the Algoma region located 50 km north of Sault Saint Marie, Ontario. The studies were undertaken to gain a better understanding of hydrology and geochemistry of watersheds in the region in order to better predict acid sensitivity of lakes. The main objective of this paper is to describe the hydrologic variations observed based on stable isotope results. Evaporative isotopic enrichment of lake water was found to be systematic across the region, and its deviation from the isotopic composition of precipitation was used to estimate the evaporation/inflow to the lakes as well as runoff (or water yield) based on a simple isotope mass balance model. The analysis illustrates significant variability in the water yield to lakes and reveals a pattern of positively skewed distributions in all six widely spaced blocks, suggesting that a high proportion of lakes have relatively limited runoff whereas relatively few have greater runoff. Such basic information on the drainage structure of an area can be valuable for site-specific hydrologic assessments but also has significant implications for critical loads assessment, as low runoff systems tend to be less buffered and therefore are more sensitive to acidification. Importantly, the Turkey Lakes sampling program also suggests that isotope-based water yield is comparable in magnitude to hydrometric gauging estimates, and also establishes that uncertainty related to stratification can be as high as ±20% or more for individual lakes, although it likely has only a minor influence on regional survey results. While further analysis in gauged lake watersheds would be beneficial to constraining the accuracy of the method or calibrating it for operational use, it is nevertheless a powerful tool in its present form for lake-to-lake and regional runoff inter-comparisons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:58:07","2018-01-20 00:58:07","","500-510","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Runoff; evaporation; hydrology; trend analysis; Uncertainty analysis; runoff; watershed; Watersheds; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; lake water; Lakes; geochemistry; Ontario [Canada]; drainage; Isotopes; stable isotope; stratification; Surveys; isotopic composition; Isotopic composition; water yield; deuterium; Deuterium; Evaporation; oxygen isotope; precipitation (chemistry); mass balance; Stable isotopes of water; Oxygen-18; acidification; Additional sampling; Algoma; Hydrologic variation; Isotope balance; Isotopic enrichment; Lake Superior; Precambrian; Sault Sainte Marie; Turkey Lakes; Turkey Lakes Watersheds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts were made through joint sample collection and the use of hydrographs and tracers to understand the rapidity of the subsurface flow response to rainstorms on hourly time scales. Three deep subsurface flows during four natural rainstorm events were monitored. The results show that (1) deeper discharge was observed early in responding rainfall events and yielded a high hydrograph amplitude; (2) a ratio index, k, reflecting the dynamic change of the rainfall perturbation intensity in subsurface flow, might reveal inner causal relationships between the flow index and the tracer signal index. Most values of k were larger than 1 at the perturbation stage but approximated 1 at the no-perturbation stage; and (3) for statistical analysis of tracer signals in subsurface flows, the total standard deviation was 17.2, 11.9, 7.4 and 3.5 at perturbation stages and 4.4, 2.5, 1.1, and 0.95 at the non-perturbation stage for observed events. These events were 3–7 times higher in the former rather than the later, reflecting that the variation of tracer signals primarily occurred under rainfall perturbation. Thus, we affirmed that the dynamic features of rainfall have a key effect on rapid processes because, besides the gravity, mechanical waves originating from dynamic rainfall features are another driving factor for conversion between different types of rainfall mechanical energy. A conceptual model for pressure wave propagation was proposed, in which virtual subsurface flow processes in a heterogeneous vadose zone under rainfall are analogous to the water hammer phenomenon in complex conduit systems. Such an analogy can allow pressure in a shallow vadose to increase and decrease and directly influence the velocity and celerity of the flow reflecting a mechanism for rapid subsurface hydrologic response processes in the shallow vadose zone. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 00:58:16","2018-01-20 00:58:16","","628-639","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; discharge; rainfall; Groundwater; numerical model; Storms; vadose zone; hydrological response; subsurface flow; Dynamics; Subsurface Flow; rainstorm; Velocity; Vadose Zone; Wave propagation; wave propagation; wave velocity; Electric conduits; Celerity; Fast response; gravity wave; Pressure waves","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model forcings are derived from a selected set of GCMs from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) statistically downscaled to a higher resolution (10 km) over Canada. Twelve hydrologic indicators that represent the magnitude and timing of the hydrologic regimes are evaluated for three 30-year time periods centered at the 1990s, 2050s and 2080s to identify significant alterations of hydrologic regimes between the reference and the two future periods using a t-test at 5% significance level. Hydrologic alteration factors (HAF) are also evaluated for each hydrologic indicator using the range of variability approach (RVA) to investigate projected changes in the distribution of these indicators. The results show increases in spring and winter flows for the two future periods at all hydrometric stations within the basin, resulting in an extended period of spring freshet. A higher rate of increase is projected for the stations located at the upper reach of the river because of the combined effects of increased precipitation and earlier snowmelt resulting from a warming climate. By contrast, summer flows are projected to decrease by up to 21% on average in the 2080s over most of the mainstem stations because of earlier snowmelt, increased evapotranspiration and no significant increase in summer precipitation. A water-management rule that optimizes impacts of water withdrawal from the lower reach of the Athabasca River under the current condition is also applied to the future scenarios to assess its relative performance under the projected climate conditions. The results indicate possible improvement in the water resources system performance in terms of increased reliability and resilience and reduced vulnerability during the two future periods as compared with those in the reference period mainly because of the projected increases in spring and winter flows, which has the potential to offset an expected future water deficit. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 00:58:24","2018-01-20 00:58:24","","327-342","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","CMIP5; Climate change; Water management; Water resources; Water resources management; evapotranspiration; global warming; optimization; performance assessment; climate change; water management; Alberta; Rivers; Climate models; vulnerability; water resource; Variable infiltration capacities; infiltration; Watersheds; Water supply; Canada; river basin; hydrological response; Athabasca River; Snow melting systems; snowmelt; CMIP; Distributed hydrologic model; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Athabasca River basin; Hydrologic alterations; Range of variability approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed procedure overcomes a major challenge of other available methods by disaggregating the time series in order to capture the main properties of the hydrologic process in both long-run and short-run. The main assumption of the conducted research is that a time series of monthly flow rates represents a stochastic process comprised of deterministic, stochastic and random components, the former of which can be further decomposed into a composite trend and two periodic components (short-term or seasonal periodicity and long-term or multi-annual periodicity). In the present paper, the deterministic component of a monthly flow time-series is assessed by spectral analysis, whereas its stochastic component is modelled using cross-correlation transfer functions, artificial neural networks and polynomial regression. The results suggest that the deterministic component can be expressed solely as a function of time, whereas the stochastic component changes as a nonlinear function of climatic factors (rainfall and temperature). For the calibration period, the results of the analysis infers a lower value of Kling-Gupta Efficiency in the case of transfer functions (0.736), whereas artificial neural networks and polynomial regression suggest a significantly better match between the observed and simulated values, 0.841 and 0.891, respectively. It seems that transfer functions fail to capture high monthly flow rates, whereas the model based on polynomial regression reproduces high monthly flows much better because it is able to successfully capture a highly nonlinear relationship between the inputs and the output. The proposed methodology that uses a combination of artificial neural networks, spectral analysis and polynomial regression for deterministic and stochastic components can be applied to forecast monthly or seasonal flow rates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:58:45","2018-01-20 00:58:45","","555-566","","","544","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; artificial neural network; river flow; time series analysis; seasonality; flow pattern; hydrological modeling; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Random processes; stochasticity; composite; Non-linear relationships; Flow rate; Spectrum analysis; Polynomials; transfer function; Transfer functions; Cross correlations; spectral analysis; Deterministic modelling; Climatic input; Deterministic approach; Deterministic component; Morava River; Polynomial regression; Serbia; Stochastic component","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Physicochemical parameters, major ions and stable isotopes were analyzed in rain, brine spring, wetland and leakage water samples, from which the most common mineral saturation indexes were computed and geochemical and isotopic modelling were performed. Results show an apparent relationship between the elevation of brine springs and their water mineralization, indicating that drainage at higher altitude may be associated to gravity-driven flows, since brackish groundwater is isotopically fractionated due to evaporation. On the other hand, the lower altitude springs could drain deeper flows with longer residence time, resulting in highly mineralized and warmer (briny) groundwater. The dissolution of halite and gypsum has proved to be the main geochemical processes, which are favored by the great ionic strength of groundwater. Calcite precipitation occurs in brackish waters draining wetlands, being boosted by common ion effect (when CaSO4 waters are present) and solute concentration caused by evaporation.

Several studies have established the viability of using portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry for elemental data analysis of soil, sediment, and other matrices. However, the accuracy of PXRF is known to be affected while scanning moisture-laden soil samples. This study used PXRF elemental data in water samples to predict water EC. A total of 256 water samples, from 10 different countries were collected and analyzed via PXRF, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and a digital salinity bridge. The PXRF detected some elements more effectively than others, but overall results indicated that PXRF can successfully predict water EC via quantifying Cl in water samples (validation R2 and RMSE of 0.77 and 0.95 log μS cm−1, respectively).

However, there is only limited information, and even fewer physical measurements, assessing the rate of sediment accumulation in reservoirs behind dams. Many of the dams within the Great Lakes Watershed were constructed between 100 and 120 years ago, and there is reasonable concern that these dams and their associated reservoirs may be reaching capacity with respect to sediment storage. As a reservoir reaches its sediment storage capacity, there are numerous risks. Excess sediment can compromise the water intake for supply systems. Dam failure or removal can potentially allow large quantities of impounded sediment to migrate downstream, negatively impacting fish habitat and water quality. This research investigates the historical function of dams as sediment storage points. Also, this research assesses the effect of anthropogenic influences including land use change and dam construction on sediment yield and accumulation within the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watershed. To better understand the historical and current sediment yield within the Lake Erie watershed, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models of the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watersheds were developed. The resulting model suggests that the average of sediment accumulation rate within Lake Rockwell Dam reservoir varies between the minimum of 1.6 and the maximum of 4.6 g/cm2/yr from 1988 to 2007.

The estimation of relative permeability is generally solved by Levenberg-Marquardt method with finite difference Jacobian approximation (LM-FD). However, the method can hardly be used in large-scale reservoirs because of unbearably huge computational cost. To eliminate this problem, the paper introduces the idea of simultaneous perturbation to simplify the generation of the Jacobian matrix needed in the Levenberg-Marquardt procedure and denotes the improved method as LM-SP. It is verified by numerical experiments and then applied to laboratory experiments and a real commercial oilfield. Numerical experiment indicates that LM-SP uses only 16.1% computational cost to obtain similar estimation of relative permeability and prediction of production performance compared with LM-FD. Laboratory experiment also shows the LM-SP has a 60.4% decrease in simulation cost while a 68.5% increase in estimation accuracy compared with the earlier published results. This is mainly because LM-FD needs 2n (n is the number of controlling knots) simulations to approximate Jacobian in each iteration, while only 2 simulations are enough in basic LM-SP. The convergence rate and estimation accuracy of LM-SP can be improved by averaging several simultaneous perturbation Jacobian approximations but the computational cost of each iteration may be increased. Considering the estimation accuracy and computational cost, averaging two Jacobian approximations is recommended in this paper. As the number of unknown controlling knots increases from 7 to 15, the saved simulation runs by LM-SP than LM-FD increases from 114 to 1164. This indicates LM-SP is more suitable than LM-FD for multivariate problems. Field application further proves the applicability of LM-SP on large real field as well as small laboratory problems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:59:27","2018-01-20 00:59:27","","604-612","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","reservoir; perturbation; numerical method; experimental study; porous medium; estimation method; Costs; least squares method; Iterative methods; laboratory method; Finite difference method; Laboratory experiments; Cost estimating; permeability; Oil fields; Porous materials; multiphase flow; Multiphase flow; Jacobian matrices; finite difference method; Relative permeability; Relative permeability curves; Approximate Jacobians; Jacobian approximation; Levenberg-Marquardt method; oil field; Perturbation techniques; Production performance; Simultaneous perturbation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, such information is necessary to develop programs and policies for protecting ecosystems and managing water resources. Here, we assess GW seepage to the Ichetucknee River, a spring-fed, low gradient, gaining stream in north-central Florida, through automated longitudinal surveys of radon (222Rn) activities at three different flow conditions. A 222Rn mass balance model, which integrates groundwater and spring water end member 222Rn activities and longitudinal 222Rn distributions in river water, shows that diffuse groundwater seepage represents about 16% of the total river baseflow, consistent with previous results obtained from ion (Ca2+, Cl−, SRP and Fe) mass balances and dye tracer methods. During high river stage, the contribution from seepage increases to 18–23% of the river flow. The spatial distribution of GW seepage is more variable in the upper 2.2-km reach of the river than the lower 2.8-km reach, regardless of river flow conditions. The upper reach has a narrower flood plain than the lower reach, which limits evapotranspiration and increases hydraulic gradients toward the river following storm events. Seepage in the lower reach is also limited by hydrologic damming by the receiving river, which inundates the floodplain during high flow conditions, and reduces the hydraulic head gradient. These results demonstrate the variable nature of seepage to a gaining river in both time and space and indicate that multiple synoptic analyses of GW seepage are required to assess seepage rates, determine time-averaged solute fluxes, and develop optimal management policies for riverine ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:59:36","2018-01-20 00:59:36","","86-96","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","United States; Water resources; groundwater; Hydrogeology; Ecology; Rivers; seepage; Floods; aquifer; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Ecosystems; automation; karst hydrology; spatial distribution; floodplain; water flow; Flow of water; Florida [United States]; Surface waters; spatial resolution; Stream flow; Hydraulic gradients; baseflow; groundwater-surface water interaction; High flow conditions; measurement method; High spatial resolution; Seepage; solute transport; hydraulic head; Ground water-surface water interactions; Longitudinal surveys; Heterogeneous distributions; Radon; spring (hydrology); radon; Groundwater seepage; Ichetucknee River; Riverine ecosystems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge. However, these models usually have a large number of parameters. The uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates. This study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model. It is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the Campaspe catchment in southeast Australia. A Monte Carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors. The results show that for a mean rainfall of 398. mm/y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters, the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144. mm/y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters. This upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236. mm/y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions. Through several synthetic test cases, this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty, whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50%. The reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:59:45","2018-01-20 00:59:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Time series; Vegetation; Monte Carlo methods; Uncertainty analysis; Parameter estimation; Groundwater; Catchments; Soil moisture; Soils; Carbon; Ground water recharge; Energy balance; Recharging (underground waters); Soil water balance; Water and energies; Energy and water balance; Soil hydraulic parameters; Sandwich structures; Pedo-transfer functions; Monte carlo analysis; Vegetation parameters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evaluating long-term rainfall erosivity is a challenging task, mainly because of the paucity of high-resolution historical precipitation observations that are generally reported at coarser temporal resolutions (e.g., monthly to annual totals). In this paper we suggest overcoming this limitation through an analysis of long-term processes governing rainfall erosivity with an application to datasets available the central Ruhr region (Western Germany) for the period 1701–2011. Based on a parsimonious interpretation of seasonal rainfall-related processes (from spring to autumn), a model was derived using 5-min erosivity data from 10 stations covering the period 1937–2002, and then used to reconstruct a long series of annual rainfall erosivity values. Change-points in the evolution of rainfall erosivity are revealed over the 1760s and the 1920s that mark three sub-periods characterized by increasing mean values. The results indicate that the erosive hazard tends to increase as a consequence of an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events occurred during the last decades, characterized by short-rain events regrouped into prolonged wet spells. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 00:59:53","2018-01-20 00:59:53","","1-9","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Germany; Rain; rainfall; reconstruction; hydrological modeling; Precipitation (meteorology); precipitation assessment; soil erosion; precipitation (climatology); storm; annual variation; Interannual variability; Temporal resolution; Seasonal rainfall; Extreme precipitation events; In-depth analysis; Long term process; North Rhine-Westphalia; Parsimonious modelling; Rainfall erosivity; Ruhr","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A dataset on the hydrologic impact of urbanization with extensive stormwater infiltration is not widely available, and is important because many municipalities are considering infiltration as an alternative to traditional stormwater systems. This study analyzes groundwater level observations from an urban catchment located in Perth, Western Australia. The groundwater observation data cover approximately a 40-year-long period where land use changes (particularly due to urbanization) occurred; moreover, the monitored area contains both undeveloped and urbanized areas where stormwater infiltration is common practice via soakwells (shallow vertical infiltration wells). The data is analyzed using a distributed and dynamic hydrological model to simulate the groundwater response. The model explicitly couples a soakwell model with a groundwater model so that the performance of the soakwells is reduced by the increase of groundwater levels. The groundwater observation data is used to setup, calibrate and validate a coupled MIKE SHE-MIKE URBAN groundwater model and the model is used to quantify the extent of groundwater rise as a result of the urbanization process. The modeled urbanization processes included the irrigation of new established private and public gardens, the reduction of evapotranspiration due to a decrease in green areas, and the development of artificial stormwater infiltration. The study demonstrates that urbanization with stormwater infiltration affects the whole catchment water balance, increasing recharge and decreasing evapotranspiration. These changes lead to a rise in the groundwater table and an increase in the probability of groundwater seepage above terrain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:00:01","2018-01-20 01:00:01","","524-537","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Evapotranspiration; Runoff; catchment; evapotranspiration; groundwater; urbanization; Urbanization; Models; hydrological modeling; Groundwater; Land use; watershed; infiltration; Catchments; Storms; Hydrology; Hydrological modeling; water level; hydrological response; land use change; water budget; recharge; stormwater; Land-use change; Urban growth; Infiltration; water table; Catchment water balance; Perth [Western Australia]; Western Australia; Catchment hydrology; Stormwater infiltrations; Perth; Vertical infiltration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is critical to assess hydroclimate model scenarios and the uncertainty in future GR to force regional groundwater models. We use basic statistics of downscaled Global Circulation Model (GCM)-projected cumulative potential GR (GRp ) for selecting representative projections. Cumulative GRp is the net recharge (difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) rates) over the projection period. The approach is illustrated with an example in the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), the largest dune region in the Western Hemisphere, where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow.Changes in decadal-average GRp at 1/8° ( 12-km) scale were estimated from spatially downscaled, bias-corrected temperature and P output from 16 commonly used GCMs for years 2010 to 2099. These changes accounted for three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and projections were subsequently used as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface hydrology model. For each of the 48. GCM/VIC hydroclimate projections, cumulative GRp was calculated and averaged over the study area. Three projections (those with cumulative average GRp nearest the median and ±1 standard deviation) were selected as representing Median, Wet and Dry conditions. These projections allow for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models, using readily available downscaled GCM-projected climate changes, thereby optimizing modeling efforts. Future GRp was calculated for the NSH using the selected GR projections by adjusting the 2000-2009 baseline GRp estimates at 1-km scale. The latter was inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model, with ET based on remote sensing (MODIS) temperature data, and matching regional baseflows.In the NSH by 2099, the Median projection indicates an increase in GRp of 3. mm/yr (+5%) relative to the 2000-2009 baseline of 52.6. mm/yr. The Wet projection has an average increase of 22. mm/yr (+42%), and the Dry projection shows an average decrease of 15. mm/yr (-29%), relative to the baseline. Effects of projection period duration and time-step averaging on selection of GR projections with this approach are discussed. The new detailed GRp projections clarify varying trends of past large-scale analyses of the Northern High Plains region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the NSH hydrologic system. This approach can be extended to other arid-to-humid regions with available GCM hydroclimate projections. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:00:09","2018-01-20 01:00:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Uncertainty analysis; Climate models; Groundwater; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing; Groundwater modeling; Ground water recharge; Recharging (underground waters); Electric power system interconnection; Global circulation model; Potential recharges; Sand hills","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important data requirement of these models is long term, high quality, high-temporal resolution rainfall data (given that the physical nature of the erosion process is strongly related to rainfall). However, in many cases such data is limited - data is often short, incomplete or not of a sufficient temporal resolution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of modelled erosion rates to small changes in rainfall input. To achieve this we firstly assess the existing rainfall data from an established weather station and secondly, stochastically generate rainfall time series based on the longest and most reliable rainfall data. We then test the sensitivity of different rainfall sequences on sediment output using a well-tested landscape evolution and sediment transport model (CAESAR-Lisflood) over a simulated period of 100 y on a proposed rehabilitated mine landform. It was found that each rainfall scenario produces a unique pattern of erosion (i.e. the location and extent of the gullies is variable). Further, each rainfall scenario produces a unique pattern of sediment output that suggests non-linear processes. Importantly, this is the first time stochastically generated rainfall has been employed in landform evolution modeling and provides a statistical approach to quantify sediment transport and landform evolution. The method demonstrates a risk based approach and allows rainfall, runoff and sediment transport studies to be conducted in data poor environments. The findings clearly demonstrate that rainfall variability can greatly affect sediment transport and form of erosion as well as landscape evolution. This information is of particular importance for the design and testing of rehabilitated landscape systems such as post-mining landscapes. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 01:00:18","2018-01-20 01:00:18","","180-194","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Time series; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Catchments; Erosion; Stochastic systems; Landforms; High temporal resolution; Statistical approach; Stochastic rainfalls; Landscape evolutions; Sediment transport model; Mine rehabilitation; Risk based approaches; Runoff and sediments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method was developed based on the assumption that data can be mapped onto an underlying differential manifold. In this study, the proposed method was used to reconstruct meteorological forcing over Lake Michigan, the bathymetry of an inland lake (Gull Lake), and precipitation over the Grand River watershed in Michigan. In the first case study, hourly meteorological forcing data were reconstructed and used to run a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Michigan and to quantify the improvement that results from the use of the new method. In the second example, the bathymetry of Gull Lake was reconstructed from measured scatter point data using the manifold technique. A hydrodynamic model of Gull Lake was developed and refined using the improved bathymetry.

All three examples illustrate the superior performance of the manifold method over standard methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, all hydrological processes are in reality constrained by physical upper limits, though not necessarily well defined. A result of this contradiction is that for sufficiently small exceedance probabilities the unbounded distributions anticipate flood magnitudes which are impossibly large. This raises the question of whether displayed return period scales should, as is current practice, have some given number of years, such as 500 years, as the terminating rightmost tick-point. This carries the implication that the scale might be extended indefinitely to the right with a corresponding indefinite increase in flood magnitude. An alternative, suggested here, is to introduce a sufficiently high upper truncation point to the flood distribution and modify the return period scale accordingly. The rightmost tick-mark then becomes infinity, corresponding to the upper truncation point discharge. The truncation point is likely to be set as being above any physical upper bound and the return period scale will change only slightly over all practical return periods of operational interest. The rightmost infinity tick point is therefore proposed, not as an operational measure, but rather to signal in flood plots that the return period scale does not extend indefinitely to the right. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:00:35","2018-01-20 01:00:35","","452-455","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Return periods; discharge; statistical distribution; Floods; Probability distributions; extreme event; return period; probability density function; flood frequency; Flood frequency; Extreme flood; Extreme value distributions; Truncated distributions; Ixodida; Upper Bound","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Groundwater storage (GWS) anomalies (relative to the long-term mean) exhibit strong seasonality, with annual maxima observed during the monsoon season and minima during pre-monsoon season. Spatial variability of GWS anomalies increases with the extent of measurements, following the power law relationship, i.e., log-(spatial variability) is linearly dependent on log-(spatial extent). In addition, the impact of well spacing on spatial variability and the power law relationship is investigated. We found that the mean GWS anomaly sampled at a 0.25 degree grid scale closes to unweighted average over all wells. The absolute error corresponding to each basin grows with increasing scale, i.e., from 0.25 degree to 1 degree. It was observed that small changes in extent could create very large changes in spatial variability at large grid scales. Spatial variability of GWS anomaly has been found to vary with climatic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study of the effects of well spacing on groundwater spatial variability. The results may be useful for interpreting large scale groundwater variations from unevenly spaced or sparse groundwater well observations or for siting and prioritizing wells in a network for groundwater management.

Statistical models have been examined as a surrogate of the high-fidelity physical model during simulation-optimization process to tackle this problem. Among them, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a non-parametric adaptive regression method, is superior in overcoming problems of high-dimensions and discontinuities of the data. Furthermore, the stability and accuracy of MARS model can be improved by bootstrap aggregating methods, namely, bagging. In this paper, Bagging MARS (BMARS) method is integrated to a surrogate-based simulation-optimization framework to calibrate a three-dimensional MODFLOW model, which is developed to simulate the groundwater flow in an arid hardrock-alluvium region in northwestern Oman. The physical MODFLOW model is surrogated by the statistical model developed using BMARS algorithm. The surrogate model, which is fitted and validated using training dataset generated by the physical model, can approximate solutions rapidly. An efficient Sobol’ method is employed to calculate global sensitivities of head outputs to input parameters, which are used to analyze their importance for the model outputs spatiotemporally. Only sensitive parameters are included in the calibration process to further improve the computational efficiency. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between measured and simulated heads at observation wells is used as the objective function to be minimized during optimization.

To understand the importance of non-free ionic fractions (NIF) of major metals in freshwater streams, Na, Mg, Ca, silicon (Si), and fulvic acid-like materials (FAM) were measured in streams of mountainous adjacent headwater catchments dominated by different vegetation types (planted evergreen coniferous forest and natural deciduous broadleaf forest). During both no rainfall periods and rainstorms, the proportion of NIF relative to total elements was lower in the coniferous catchment than in the deciduous catchment, although it sometimes accounted for half or more of the total concentrations of Na, Mg, and Ca in both catchments. The solubility of metal compounds was higher than the measured maximum concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ to the extent that inorganic bonding was hardly possible. During no rainfall periods when FAM was slightly produced into the streams, the fluxes of NIF and Si were highly correlated (r &gt; 0.92, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 30) in both catchments. During a small rainstorm, the flux of NIF correlated weakly with that of Si but did not correlate with that of FAM in both catchments. In contrast, during a heavy rainstorm, the flux of NIF correlated strongly (r ⩾ 0.83, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 26) with that of FAM in the deciduous catchment where relatively deep soil water compared to near-surface water was the predominant component of stream water. However, during the heavy rainstorm in the coniferous catchment, only the flux of NIF originated in the quick-flow component (i.e., surface or near-surface water) in stream water (ΔNIF) correlated strongly (r ⩾ 0.81, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 22) with that of FAM. These findings imply that heavy rainstorms may enhance the bonding of the major metals with humic substances mainly in the deciduous catchment; and also exhibit that, in the headwater catchments, both water flow pathways resulted from the different vegetation types play a very important role to promote the bonding of major metals with humic substances in stream water. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:01:08","2018-01-20 01:01:08","","58-73","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Metals; Rain; Runoff; Vegetation; catchment; Rivers; concentration (composition); Water; Catchments; Flow of water; Forestry; Storms; Soil moisture; Surface waters; calcium; Calcium; magnesium; Magnesium; streamwater; water chemistry; rainstorm; Biological materials; headwater; Thunderstorms; vegetation type; Japan; humic substance; Silicon; inorganic compound; solubility; ionic composition; Headwater catchment; organic compound; Organic acids; Bonding; chemical bonding; Chemical bonds; Coniferous forests; Freshwater streams; fulvic acid; Fulvic acids; Highly-correlated; Humic substances; Major metal; Maximum concentrations; Photodegradation; sodium","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Observations were used to quantify seasonal changes in transpiration rates with respect to temporal fluctuations of the local water table depth. The applicability of a Modified Jarvis-Stewart transpiration model (MJS), which requires soil-water content data, was assessed for this system. The influence of single depth values compared to use of vertically averaged soil-water content data on MJS-modelled transpiration was assessed over both a wet and a dry season, where the water table depth varied from the surface to a depth of 1.4 m below the surface. Data for tree transpiration rates relative to water table depth showed that trees transpire when the water table was above a threshold depth of 0.8 m below the ground surface (water availability is non-limiting). When the water table reached the ground surface (i.e., surface flooding) transpiration was found to be limited. When the water table is below this threshold depth, a linear relationship between water table depth and the transpiration rate was observed. MJS modelling results show that the influence of different choices for soil-water content on transpiration predictions was insignificant in the wet season. However, during the dry season, inclusion of deeper soil-water content data improved the model performance (except for days after isolated rainfall events, here a shallower soil-water representation was better). This study demonstrated that, to improve MJS simulation results, appropriate selection of soil water measurement depths based on the dynamic behaviour of soil water profiles through the root zone was required in a shallow unconfined aquifer system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:01:17","2018-01-20 01:01:17","","242-253","","","544","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Australia; Vegetation; Drought; hydrological modeling; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Forestry; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Soil surveys; shallow water; Soil water content; Queensland; water table; rhizosphere; soil depth; Transpiration; unconfined aquifer; Unconfined aquifers; transpiration; water depth; coniferous forest; Water table depths; Coniferophyta; Groundwater-dependent vegetations; Modified Jarvis-Stewart","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The case-study presented in this paper investigates the impact of the geometry and interface conditions around a conduit on the spatial distribution of these exchanges. Isotopic (δ18O and δD), discharge and water head measurements were conducted at the resurgences of a karst system with a strong allogenic recharge component (Val d'Orléans, France), to estimate the amounts of water exchanged and the mixings between a saturated karstic conduit and the surrounding aquifer. The spatio-temporal variability of the observed exchanges was explored using a 2D coupled continuum-conduit flow model under saturated conditions (Feflow®). The inputs from the water heads and stable water isotopes in the groundwater flow model suggest that the amounts of water flowing from the aquifer are significant if the conduit flow discharges are less than the conduit flow capacity. This condition creates a spatial distribution of exchanges from upstream where the aquifer feeds the conduit (recharge area) to downstream where the conduit reaches its maximum discharge capacity and can feed the aquifer (discharge area). In the intermediate transport zone no exchange between the two domains takes place that brings a new criterion to delineate the vulnerable zones to surface water. On average, 4% of the water comes from the local recharge, 80% is recent river water and 16% is old river water. During the November 2008 flood, both isotopic signatures and model suggest that exchanges fluctuate around this steady state, limited when the river water level increases and intensified when the river water level decreases. The existence of old water from the river suggests a transient storage at the aquifer/conduit interface that can be considered as an underground hyporheic zone. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:01:25","2018-01-20 01:01:25","","278-289","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water resources; Hydrogeology; Rivers; Groundwater flow; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; karst hydrology; Spatial distribution; spatial distribution; France; Water levels; groundwater flow; water storage; river water; Surface waters; water level; flow modeling; Isotopes; stable isotope; Recharging (underground waters); hydraulic head; water exchange; saturation; Water exchange; Stable isotopes; Confined flow; Karst hydrology; Coupled flow; Saturated conduit; vertical mixing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel methodology to support and complement drought monitoring and early warning in regulated water resources systems. It is based in the combined use of two models, a water resources optimization model and a stochastic streamflow generation model, to generate a series of results that allow evaluating the future state of the system. The results for the period 1998–2009 in the Jucar River Basin (Spain) show that accounting for scenario change risk can be beneficial for basin managers by providing them with information on the current and future drought situation at any given moment.

One of the basic challenges is modeling Ep using limited climatic parameters because there are a number of factors affecting the evaporation rate. This study investigated the abilities of six different soft computing methods, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), fuzzy genetic (FG), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with grid partition (ANFIS-GP), and two regression methods, multiple linear regression (MLR) and Stephens and Stewart model (SS) in predicting monthly Ep. Long-term climatic data at various sites crossing a wide range of climates during 1961–2000 are used for model development and validation. The results showed that the models have different accuracies in different climates and the MLP model performed superior to the other models in predicting monthly Ep at most stations using local input combinations (for example, the MAE (mean absolute errors), RMSE (root mean square errors), and determination coefficient (R2) are 0.314 mm/day, 0.405 mm/day and 0.988, respectively for HEB station), while GRNN model performed better in Tibetan Plateau (MAE, RMSE and R2 are 0.459 mm/day, 0.592 mm/day and 0.932, respectively). The accuracies of above models ranked as: MLP, GRNN, LSSVM, FG, ANFIS-GP, MARS and MLR. The overall results indicated that the soft computing techniques generally performed better than the regression methods, but MLR and SS models can be more preferred at some climatic zones instead of complex nonlinear models, for example, the BJ (Beijing), CQ (Chongqing) and HK (Haikou) stations. Therefore, it can be concluded that Ep could be successfully predicted using above models in hydrological modeling studies. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:01:47","2018-01-20 01:01:47","","407-427","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Pan evaporation; Regression analysis; Water resources; artificial neural network; evaporation; regression analysis; Linear regression; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; environmental factor; hydrological modeling; computer simulation; Least squares approximations; Climate models; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Soft computing; Softcomputing techniques; Support vector machines; model validation; fuzzy mathematics; Mean square error; Complex networks; support vector machine; climate conditions; Agricultural machinery; Evaporation; Heuristic methods; heuristics; Model comparison; Least square support vector machines; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Regression method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Low rainfall across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia resulted in an unprecedented water level decline in the Lower Lakes (Lakes Alexandrina and Albert) at the downstream end of the river system. A comprehensive data covering pre-drought (2004–2006), drought (2007–2010) and post-drought (2010–2013) was firstly used to unravel drought effects on water quality in the contrasting main parts and margins of the two Lakes, particularly following water acidification resulting from acid sulfate soil oxidation. Salinity, nutrients and Chl-a significantly increased during the drought in the Lake main waterbody, while pH remained stable or showed minor shifts. In contrast to the Lake Alexandrina, total dissolved solid (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) during the post-drought more than doubled the pre-drought period in the Lake Albert as being a terminal lake system with narrow and shallow entrance. Rewetting of the exposed pyrite-containing sediment resulted in very low pH (below 3) in Lake margins, which positively contributed to salinity increases via SO42− release and limestone dissolution. Very acidic water (pH 2–3) was neutralised naturally by lake refill, but aerial limestone dosing was required for neutralisation of water acidity during the drought period. The Lower Lakes are characterized as hypereutrophic with much higher salinity, nutrient and algae concentrations than guideline levels for aquatic ecosystem.

Rainfall and air temperature are considered as additional predictors in the proposed modeling framework. In GM-NHMM, a six-state model is constructed with three predictors representing an unobserved state associated with SM. It is clearly seen that the rainfall predictor plays a substantial role in achieving the overall predictability. Using weather variables (i.e., rainfall and temperature) can be effective in picking up some of the predictability of local SM that is not captured by the AMSR2 data. On the other hand, larger scale dynamic features identified from the AMSR2 data seem to facilitate the identification of regional spatial patterns of SM. The efficiency of the proposed model is compared with that of an ordinary regression model (OLR) using the same predictors. The mean correlation coefficient of the proposed model is about 0.78, which is significantly greater than that of the OLR at about 0.49.

MAF can be quantified with spatially explicit process-based models, which might be overly time-consuming and data-intensive for this purpose, or with empirical regression models that predict MAF based on climate and catchment characteristics. Yet, regression models have mostly been developed at a regional scale and the extent to which they can be extrapolated to other regions is not known. In this study, we developed a global-scale regression model for MAF based on a dataset unprecedented in size, using observations of discharge and catchment characteristics from 1885 catchments worldwide, measuring between 2 and 106 km2. In addition, we compared the performance of the regression model with the predictive ability of the spatially explicit global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB by comparing results from both models to independent measurements. We obtained a regression model explaining 89% of the variance in MAF based on catchment area and catchment averaged mean annual precipitation and air temperature, slope and elevation. The regression model performed better than PCR-GLOBWB for the prediction of MAF, as root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were lower (0.29–0.38 compared to 0.49–0.57) and the modified index of agreement (d) was higher (0.80–0.83 compared to 0.72–0.75).

Here we address questions about the nonlinear behavior of flux variability in the vadose zone that may explain previously reported teleconnections between global-scale climate variability and fluctuations in groundwater levels. We use hundreds of HYDRUS-1D simulations in a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous United States (U.S). Although the models were parameterized based on U.S. aquifers, findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3.65 and 730mmyr- 1. We find that mean infiltration flux, period of time varying infiltration, and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth. The resulting framework explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability dampen with depth in the vadose zone, resulting in steady-state recharge, while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth, resulting in transient recharge. We find that transient recharge in response to the climate variability patterns could be detected at the depths of water levels in most U.S. aquifers. Our findings indicate that the damping behavior of transient infiltration fluxes is linear across soil layers for a range of texture combinations. The implications are that relatively simple, homogeneous models of the vadose zone may provide reasonable estimates of the damping depth of climate-varying transient recharge in some complex, layered vadose zone profiles. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:02:30","2018-01-20 01:02:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Sensitivity analysis; Climatology; Hydrogeology; Climate variability; Climate models; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Water levels; Soils; Infiltration; Hydraulic parameters; Recharging (underground waters); Recharge; Vadose Zone; Transient recharges; Damping; Infiltration fluxes; Linear superpositions; Periodic boundary conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is composed of two water-stores (soil water and groundwater) and considers their connectivity to runoff in terms of both water and isotope budgets. In a meso-scale basin in which riverbed deformations frequently occur, making automatic observation of river discharge difficult, we measured hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) of precipitation and river water twice-weekly for one year. Runoff predicted by the model agreed well with that observed monthly or bimonthly. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a strong coherence between model performance in isotope simulation and runoff prediction, demonstrating that the use of isotopes as dynamic proxies of calibration targets helps reliably constrain model parameters. Our results indicate that this approach can serve as a powerful tool for prediction of runoff hydrographs, particularly for basins in which the stage-discharge relationship is highly variable. © 2016 The Author(s)","2017","2018-01-20 01:02:39","2018-01-20 01:02:39","","567-574","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Model performance; Runoff; connectivity; gauge; prediction; river discharge; Monte Carlo methods; hydrological modeling; Forecasting; Groundwater; runoff; calibration; Budget control; Intelligent systems; Soil moisture; river water; hydrograph; precipitation (climatology); Isotopes; hydrogen isotope; isotopic analysis; oxygen isotope; Hydrologic science; Prediction in ungauged basins; stage-discharge relationship; Oxygen isotope composition; Predictions in ungauged basins; Calibration targets; Meso scale; Tank models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a balanced bootstrap resampling (BBRS) with frequency analysis, we quantified considerable uncertainty in precipitation and runoff quantiles due to the sampling variability of systematic observations (e.g., −43% to +49% relative differences from the quantile estimates for the original sample). These differences are higher than suggested increase in design rainfall and floods by many countries for climate change adjustment. The uncertainties in IDF curves and derived design storm hyetographs are found to have large effects on the reliability of sizing of stormwater pipes. The study also indicated low validity of the assumptions on extreme precipitation and runoff relationships in the return period-based method for the partially paved urban catchment: (i) maximum of only 46% of the AMS of extreme precipitation and runoff events occurred concurrently and (ii) T-year return period extreme precipitation events do not necessarily result in T-year flood events. These indicate that there are effects of snowmelt seasonality, and probably catchment moisture states and interactions between the flows in subsurface media and pipes.

However, the applicability of physically-based models is only rarely tested in the field at the appropriate scale. This paper presents results of a spray irrigation experiment conducted on a plot of 100 m2 on an Alpine slope susceptible to shallow landsliding. Infiltrating precipitation applied at a constant rate (27.5 mm/h for 5.3 h) was monitored by means of 2D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography, combined with time-domain reflectometry sensors installed at various depths. In addition, regolith characteristics were assessed by dynamic cone penetration tests using a light-weight cone penetrometer. The spray irrigation experiment resulted in a vertically progressing wetting front to a depth of 80–100 cm. Below that, the unconsolidated material was already saturated by rainfall in the previous days. The observed mean resistivity reduction attributed to infiltrating water during irrigation was scaled to pressure head. Mean variations in pore pressure were reproduced by a linear diffusion model also used in physically-based dynamic landslide susceptibility modelling. Sensitive parameters (hydraulic conductivity and specific storage) were tested over selected value ranges and calibrated. Calibrated parameter values are within published and experimentally derived ranges. The results of the comparison of observations and model results suggest that the model is capable of reproducing mean changes of pore pressure at a suitable scale for physically-based modelling of shallow landslide susceptibility.

A total of five experiments were conducted in which all experimental parameters were kept constant except for the oscillation period, which ranged from 268 s to 2449 s between tests. Moisture content and suction head sensor pairings were co-located at two locations in the unsaturated zone both approximately 0.2 m above the mean watertable elevation and respectively 0.3 m and 0.75 m from the driving head boundary. For all oscillation periods except for the shortest (T=268s), the formation of a hysteretic moisture-pressure scanning loop was observed. Consistent with the decay of the saturated zone groundwater wave, the size of the observed moisture-pressure scanning loops decayed with increasing distance landward and the decay rate is larger for the shorter oscillation periods. At the shortest period (T=268s), the observed moisture-pressure relationship was observed to be non-hysteretic but with a capillary capacity that differs from that of the static equilibrium wetting and drying curves. This finding is consistent with observations from existing one-dimensional vertical sand column experiments. The relative damping of the moisture content with distance landward is higher than that for the suction head consistent with the fact that transmission of pressure through a porous medium occurs more readily than mass transfer. This is further supported by the fact that observed phase lags for the unsaturated zone variables (i.e. suction head and moisture content) relative to the driving head are greater than the saturated zone variables (i.e. piezometric head). Harmonic analysis of the data reveals no observable generation of higher harmonics in either moisture or pressure despite the strongly non-linear relationship between the two. In addition, a phase lag of moisture content relative to the suction head was observed indicating that the response time of the moisture content to watertable motion is greater than that of the pore water pressure. The observed moisture-pressure dynamics are qualitatively reproduced using a hysteretic Richards’ equation model. However, quantitative differences exist which are likely to be due to previous findings that demonstrated that the Richards’ equation model is unable to accurately reproduce the observed watertable wave dispersion, particularly at shorter period oscillations. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 01:03:13","2018-01-20 01:03:13","","467-478","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; harmonic analysis; data set; two-dimensional modeling; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; porous medium; mass transfer; Mass transfer; quantitative analysis; Non-linear relationships; Moisture; Moisture determination; Laboratories; laboratory method; unsaturated flow; unconfined aquifer; Porous materials; Richards equation; WETTING AND DRYING; Hysteresis; hysteresis; Pore-water pressures; Decay (organic); Dispersion (waves); Unsaturated flows; flume experiment; Experimental parameters; Harmonic analysis; oscillating flow; Oscillation periods; Oscillatory flows; Sand column experiments; wave damping; wave dispersion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A promising technology that can lead to improved removal of TOrCs is the sequential MAR technology (SMART), which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon-limited conditions resulting in enhanced TOrCs transformation. The aim of this study was to test the performance of the SMART concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional MAR using pond infiltration (cMAR) operated in Berlin, Germany. Although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200[U+202F]cm, redox conditions were more stable at the SMART facility fed with bank filtrate. In addition, carbon-limited conditions were solely observed during SMART. Chemicals known to persist during MAR, including candesartan, carbamazepine, dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine, olmesartan, oxypurinol, phenylethylmalonamide, primidone, and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites, whereas valsartan acid, metformin, and gabapentin-lactam were removed by more than 85% during 200[U+202F]cm of infiltration. 4-Formylaminoantipyrine, acesulfame, benzotriazole, and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during SMART compared to the cMAR site. These results confirm that SMART can result in controlled oxic and carbon-depleted subsurface conditions during MAR facilitating an improved transformation of moderately degradable TOrCs by natural treatment processes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:03:22","2018-01-20 01:03:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Potable water; Organic carbon; Ground water recharge; Infiltration; Recharging (underground waters); Dissolved organic carbon; Managed aquifer recharges; Industrial chemicals; Organic chemicals; Trace organic chemicals; Redox condition; Chemicals; Drug products","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The World Health Organisation promotes an approach where the emphasis is on mitigating risks close to the contamination source. In order to handle microbial risks efficiently, there is a need for systematic risk management. In this paper we present a framework for microbial risk management of drinking water systems. The framework incorporates cost-benefit analysis as a decision support method. The hydrological Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was set up for the Stäket catchment area in Sweden, was used to simulate the effects of four different mitigation measures on microbial concentrations. The modelling results showed that the two mitigation measures that resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) reduction of Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli concentrations were a vegetative filter strip linked to cropland and improved treatment (by one Log10 unit) at the wastewater treatment plants. The mitigation measure with a vegetative filter strip linked to grazing areas resulted in a significant reduction of Cryptosporidium spp., but not of E. coli concentrations. The mitigation measure with enhancing the removal efficiency of all on-site wastewater treatment systems (total removal of 2 Log10 units) did not achieve any significant reduction of E. coli or Cryptosporidium spp. concentrations.

Based on almost six years of daily SF data from nine teak trees in a Thai plantation, together with detailed above-canopy meteorological data and daily leaf area index (LAI) data, this study sought to better understand how specific biotic and abiotic factors affect both individual and stand-scale SF production from teak trees. Specifically, the factors affecting stemflow funneling ratio (SFFR) at individual and stand scales were analyzed and compared by means of boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis. The largest variation of SFFR among individual teak trees was observed in the leafed state. For trees taller than average, the BRT analysis revealed that vapor pressure deficit during rain was the most influential factor affecting SFFR. Vapor pressure deficit had a negative influence on SFFR, implying significant control of evaporative demand during rain. In contrast, for trees shorter than the average, rain duration (RD) was the most influential variable, having a positive correlation with SFFR. The stand-scale BRT analysis for all nine teak trees demonstrated that RD was the most influential factor affecting SFFR (exerting positive influence) but that an array of other factors (both abiotic and biotic) played intricate and complex roles in governing SFFR. The effect of LAI on SFFR was complicated and varied greatly among individual teak trees. It is possible that spatially heterogeneous flowpaths of intercepted water inside the teak canopy, which could be a product of the large-sized mature leaves of teak, may account for the tree-to-tree variation in the responses of SFFR to changing LAI. Although our study focused on teak trees, the demonstrated physically-based mechanistic explanations of stemflow production could apply to other even-aged deciduous forests and monospecific plantations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:03:39","2018-01-20 01:03:39","","10-20","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; phenology; environmental factor; Meteorology; Forestry; Plants (botany); deciduous tree; Factor analysis; plantation forestry; leaf area index; vapor pressure; Stemflow; deciduous forest; Deciduous forest; forest floor; Hydrostatic pressure; Leaf Area Index; Monospecific plantation; Phenophase; Tectona grandis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Managing this resource in a sustainable way is critical for water resource management. Groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under-researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. This study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing water budget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern Switzerland. In order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was carried out.Our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. In detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. However, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the MC approach. Based on our water budget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. Furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. Overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. We hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:03:48","2018-01-20 01:03:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Water budget; Water management; Water resources; Urbanization; Hydrogeology; Uncertainty analysis; Groundwater; Water conservation; Budget control; Ground water recharge; Switzerland; Urban growth; Recharging (underground waters); Surface sealing; Urban hydrogeologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is still unclear what such understandings mean for perspectives on water security in general and on causes and solutions related to perceived water security risks and problems in agricultural sector in particular. Based on a systematic literature review, three conceptualizations of water security, related to different paradigms, are presented. Also the consequences of such conceptualizations for determining research objectives, research activities, and research outcomes on agricultural water security are discussed. The results showed that agricultural water security from a positivist paradigm referred to tangible and measurable water-related hazards and threats, such as floods and droughts, pollution, and so forth. A constructivist approach to agricultural water security, constituted by a process of interaction and negotiation, pointed at perceptions of water security of farmers and other stakeholders involved in agricultural sector. A critical approach to agricultural water security focused on the processes of securing vulnerable farmers and others from wider political, social, and natural impediments to sufficient water supplies.

The MBLRP model reproduces the underlying distribution of the rainfall generating process. The existing optimization techniques are typically based on individual parameter estimates that treat each parameter as independent. However, parameter estimates sometimes compensate for the estimates of other parameters, which can cause high variability in the results if the covariance structure is not formally considered. Moreover, uncertainty associated with model parameters in the MBLRP rainfall generator is not usually addressed properly. Here, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM)-based MBLRP model to jointly estimate parameters across weather stations and explicitly consider the covariance and uncertainty through a Bayesian framework. The model is tested using weather stations in South Korea. The HBM-based MBLRP model improves the identification of parameters with better reproduction of rainfall statistics at various temporal scales. Additionally, the spatial variability of the parameters across weather stations is substantially reduced compared to that of other methods. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:04:04","2018-01-20 01:04:04","","210-223","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian networks; Parameter estimation; Stochastic systems; Covariance structures; Weather information services; Hierarchical bayesian; Hierarchical Bayesian modeling; Optimization techniques; Rainfall simulations; Rectangular pulse; Underlying distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Woody plant cover can alter the timing and amount of plant available moisture in the soil and saprolite. To assess spatiotemporal subsurface moisture dynamics over two water years in a snow-dominated western juniper stand we compared moisture dynamics horizontally across a discontinuous canopy, and vertically in soil and saprolite. We monitored soil moisture at 15 and 60 cm and conducted periodic electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography surveys aimed at sensing moisture changes within the root zone and saprolite. Timing of soil moisture dry down at 15 cm was very similar between canopy patches and interspace. Conversely, dry down at 60 cm occurred 22 days earlier in the interspace than under canopy patches. After rainfall, interspaces with more shrubs showed greater increases in soil moisture than interspaces with few shrubs. For the few rainfall events that were large enough to increase soil moisture at 60 cm, increases in moisture occurred almost exclusively below the canopy. Soil water holding capacity from 0 to 150 cm was a primary driver of areas that were associated with the greatest change in distributed electrical conductivity - an indicator of changes in soil moisture - across the growing season. Vegetation was also correlated with a greater seasonal change in electrical conductivity at these depths. The seasonal change in resistivity suggested moisture extraction by juniper well into the saprolite, as deep as 12 m below the surface. This change in deep subsurface resistivity primarily occurred below medium and large juniper trees. This study suggests how tree roots are both increasing infiltration below their canopy while also extracting moisture at depths of upwards of 12 m.

Results indicate that TWS experienced a decreasing trend in Central Asia from 2003 to 2013 at a rate of −4.44 ± 2.2 mm/a, and that the maximum positive anomaly for TWS (46 mm) occurred in July 2005, while the minimum negative anomaly (−32.5 mm) occurred in March 2008–August 2009. The decreasing trend of TWS in northern Central Asia (−3.86 ± 0.63 mm/a) is mainly attributed to soil moisture storage depletion, which is driven primarily by the increase in evapotranspiration. In the mountainous regions, climate change exerted an influence on TWS by affecting glaciers and snow cover change.

At low EDTA concentrations, the behaviour of EuIII was mainly driven by Eu3+adsorption and complexation by carbonates and EDTA.

Previous research has shown that smooth hydraulic conductivity (K) estimates are obtained beyond where pumping/observation data are available using the geostatistical inversion approach, when the inversion begins with a homogeneous K and when data densities are not high. However, geological data are typically available through outcrops and borehole logs to provide geological variability. Therefore, we investigate the usefulness of geological data for HT analysis at a highly heterogeneous field site by: (1) comparing calibrated geological models of two different resolutions to two homogeneous and four highly parameterized geostatistical inverse models, in terms of both model calibration and validation performances as well as correspondence of estimated K values with permeameter-estimated K profiles along boreholes; and (2) using geological models as prior information for the geostatistical inversion approach. Results reveal that the simultaneous calibration of geological models to seven pumping test data yields K values that correctly reflect the general patterns of vertical distributions of permeameter-estimated K. We also find that the geostatistical inversion approach using a geological model as prior information performs better for both model calibration and validation than using a homogenous K as a prior, and more importantly, improves the correspondence of K estimates to permeameter test results along wells, as well as in preserving geological features where drawdown measurements are lacking.

Because current methods to estimate θ(h) are, in general, tedious and time consuming, alternative procedures to determine θ(h) are needed. Using an upward infiltration curve, the main objective of this work is to present a method to determine the parameters of the van Genuchten (1980) water retention curve (α and n) from the sorptivity (S) and the β parameter defined in the 1D infiltration equation proposed by Haverkamp et al. (1994). The first specific objective is to present an equation, based on the Haverkamp et al. (1994) analysis, which allows describing an upward infiltration process. Secondary, assuming a known saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, calculated on a finite soil column by the Darcy's law, a numerical procedure to calculate S and β by the inverse analysis of an exfiltration curve is presented. Finally, the α and n values are numerically calculated from Ks, S and β. To accomplish the first specific objective, cumulative upward infiltration curves simulated with HYDRUS-1D for sand, loam, silt and clay soils were compared to those calculated with the proposed equation, after applying the corresponding β and S calculated from the theoretical Ks, α and n. The same curves were used to: (i) study the influence of the exfiltration time on S and β estimations, (ii) evaluate the limits of the inverse analysis, and (iii) validate the feasibility of the method to estimate α and n. Next, the θ(h) parameters estimated with the numerical method on experimental soils were compared to those obtained with pressure cells. The results showed that the upward infiltration curve could be correctly described by the modified Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation. While S was only affected by early-time exfiltration data, the β parameter had a significant influence on the long-time exfiltration curve, which accuracy increased with time. The 1D infiltration model was only suitable for β &lt; 1.7 (sand, loam and silt). After omitting the clay soil, an excellent relationship (R2 = 0.99, p &lt; 0.005) was observed between the theoretical α and n values of the synthetic soils and those estimated from the inverse analysis. Consistent results, with a significant relationship (p &lt; 0.001) between the n values estimated with the pressure cell and the upward infiltration analysis, were also obtained on the experimental soils. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:04:55","2018-01-20 01:04:55","","352-362","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","water content; numerical method; infiltration; Numerical methods; Soil hydraulic properties; Soil moisture; soil water; Soils; Flow of fluids; hydraulic conductivity; Infiltration; inverse analysis; Inverse problems; Volumetric water content; Hydraulic conductivity; Saturated hydraulic conductivity; water retention; Clay; Darcy law; Water retention curve; soil column; Aluminum; Infiltration modeling; Infiltration process; Silt; sorption; Soil water retention curves; matric potential; Alternative procedures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to isolate the impact of land leveling, performed on an agricultural field (Québec, Canada) in spring 2012, on runoff and TSS load and to make recommendations to attenuate adverse environmental impacts of land leveling, if any. A total of 66 runoff events, including 22 with total suspended sediments (TSS) load estimates, from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. To this end, deterministic models were coupled to an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the unknown distribution of the parameters representing the most important effects, namely land leveling, tillage, and crop cover. Simulated runoff events were generated by the hydrological model SWMM version 5 while simulated TSS loads were generated by an empirical equation based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2). Thanks to the algorithm used, it was demonstrated that land leveling significantly decreased total runoff volume at least for the two following years. The impact on peak flow was mixed: land leveling significantly decreased peak flow for a typical stratiform rainfall event but the effect was unclear for a typical convective rainfall event. Based on 90% confidence interval, TSS load increased from 10 to 1000 times immediately after land leveling (spring 2012) compared to pre-land leveling events. The TSS load increase remained significant one year after land leveling, with TSS loads 5–20 times higher compared to pre-land leveling events. It would thus be recommended to grow crops with high ground coverage ratios coupled with cover crops during the year when land leveling is done. Sediment retention structures could also be installed at the beginning of the land leveling process to provide protection against the short term and delayed impact on water quality. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:08","2018-01-20 01:05:08","","488-499","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; Runoff; Water quality; algorithm; water quality; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; Sediment transport; Sediments; Agriculture; runoff; Environmental impact; Crops; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; suspended load; Hydrological modeling; peak flow; confidence interval; measurement method; Suspended sediments; suspended sediment; Agricultural runoff; retention; Suspended sediment loads; Total suspended sediments; Peak flows; Adverse environmental impacts; Adaptive metropolis; cover crop; Land leveling; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; Revised universal soil loss equations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we are interested specifically in daily and sub-daily extreme values of precipitation at gauged or ungauged locations which are important for design. The purpose of the paper is to develop a methodology to combine daily precipitation observations and radar measurements to estimate sub-daily extremes at point locations. Radar data corrected using precipitation-reflectivity relationships lead to biased estimations of extremes. Different possibilities of correcting systematic errors using the daily observations are investigated. Observed gauged daily amounts are interpolated to unsampled points and subsequently disaggregated using the sub-daily values obtained by the radar. Different corrections based on the spatial variability and the subdaily entropy of scaled rainfall distributions are used to provide unbiased corrections of short duration extremes. Additionally a statistical procedure not based on a matching day by day correction is tested. In this last procedure as we are only interested in rare extremes, low to medium values of rainfall depth were neglected leaving a small number of L days of ranked daily maxima in each set per year, whose sum typically comprises about 50% of each annual rainfall total. The sum of these L day maxima is first iterpolated using a Kriging procedure. Subsequently this sum is disaggregated to daily values using a nearest neighbour procedure. The daily sums are then disaggregated by using the relative values of the biggest L radar based days. Of course, the timings of radar and gauge maxima can be different, so the method presented here uses radar for disaggregating daily gauge totals down to 15 min intervals in order to extract the maxima of sub-hourly through to daily rainfall. The methodologies were tested in South Africa, where an S-band radar operated relatively continuously at Bethlehem from 1998 to 2003, whose scan at 1.5 km above ground [CAPPI] overlapped a dense (10 km spacing) set of 45 pluviometers recording in the same 6-year period. This valuable set of data was obtained from each of 37 selected radar pixels [1 km square in plan] which contained a pluviometer not masked out by the radar foot-print. The pluviometer data were also aggregated to daily totals, for the same purpose. The extremes obtained using disaggregation methods were compared to the observed extremes in a cross validation procedure. The unusual and novel goal was not to obtain the reproduction of the precipitation matching in space and time, but to obtain frequency distributions of the point extremes, which we found to be stable. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:16","2018-01-20 01:05:16","","397-406","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Rain; rainfall; radar; spatiotemporal analysis; Precipitation (meteorology); Nearest neighbour; spatial variation; data acquisition; kriging; Daily precipitations; precipitation (climatology); hydrometeorology; Frequency distributions; Gages; Disaggregation; Radar measurement; Spatial variability; Radar; South Africa; Precipitation (chemical); Space-based radar; Systematic errors; entropy; Point precipitation; Biased estimation; Rainfall distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Affecting not only groundwater levels and flow dynamics, climate change can also modify the fragmentation and hierarchy of groundwater flow systems. In this study, the influence of climate change - impacted recharge on groundwater levels and on inter-connected groundwater flow patterns is evaluated. Special emphasis is placed on how flow system hierarchy may change, to examine possible consequences on groundwater-related shallow surface water bodies and on groundwater - surface water interaction. As a test site with no significant anthropogenic impacts, the Tihany Peninsula in Hungary was an ideal area for the study. We address the following issues: i) How might a groundwater system, including groundwater-surface water interaction, be modified by predicted climate change?, ii) Given the variable groundwater levels and flow patterns, how will the water levels and fluxes be impacted around surface water bodies?, and iii) How sensitive are groundwater-related wetlands to these changes, and will they be maintained or will they eventually disappear? In order to answer these questions, two-dimensional transient numerical simulations were performed based on site-specific measurements and climatic prediction at the Tihany Peninsula. Results show that future climate trends can cause dynamic evolution and dissipation of transient groundwater flow systems, and the characteristic flow system hierarchy can change from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells. Preservation of associated groundwater-dependent ecosystems would be challenging under these conditions since long-term climate change could potentially have serious consequences, including wetland disappearance. Understanding these transient processes in two-dimensions can also help to set-up three-dimensional site-specific models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:25","2018-01-20 01:05:25","","456-466","","","544","","Journal of Hydrology","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","Climate change; Ecology; Groundwater flow; Groundwater; Ecosystems; Flow patterns; Water levels; Surface waters; Wetlands; Recharging (underground waters); Numerical models; Ground water-surface water interactions; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Transient groundwater flow; Flow systems; Site-specific measurement; Tihany Peninsula; Transient numerical simulation; Two-dimensional transient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way to solve the problem is to employ an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm in the derivation of large-scale reservoir operating rules. In this study, the Weighted Multi-Objective Adaptive Surrogate Model Optimization (WMO-ASMO) algorithm is used. It consists of three steps: (1) simplifying the large-scale reservoir operating rules by the aggregation-decomposition model, (2) identifying the most sensitive parameters through multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) for dimensional reduction, and (3) reducing computational cost and speeding the searching process by WMO-ASMO, embedded with weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGAII). The intercomparison of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII), WNSGAII and WMO-ASMO are conducted in the large-scale reservoir system of Xijiang river basin in China. Results indicate that: (1) WNSGAII surpasses NSGAII in the median of annual power generation, increased by 1.03% (from 523.29 to 528.67 billion kW h), and the median of ecological index, optimized by 3.87% (from 1.879 to 1.809) with 500 simulations, because of the weighted crowding distance and (2) WMO-ASMO outperforms NSGAII and WNSGAII in terms of better solutions (annual power generation (530.032 billion kW h) and ecological index (1.675)) with 1000 simulations and computational time reduced by 25% (from 10 h to 8 h) with 500 simulations. Therefore, the proposed method is proved to be more efficient and could provide better Pareto frontier. © 2016","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:34","2018-01-20 01:05:34","","613-627","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; Sensitivity analysis; optimization; reservoir; sensitivity analysis; genetic algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Optimization; Ecology; Watersheds; assessment method; Genetic algorithms; surrogate method; Surrogate model; River basins; index method; Scales (weighing instruments); power generation; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm - ii; Xi Basin; aggregation; Reservoir operating rules; decomposition; Crowding distance; Intrinsic characteristics; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose a canonical form for k that reflects the physics of dispersion and suits complex flow conditions encountered in natural streams. This general form is much more concise than previous predictors. A predictor for k of natural streams is also obtained using a genetic programming(GP) without pre-specified correlations among field data or a pre-specified form of the predictor. This predictor is physically sound (i.e. exhibits the aforementioned canonical form) and appears to be commensurate to or better than previous estimates of k. A grey model, which measures the proximity of data to a target shape (i.e. the proposed physically sound form), is also used to verify that the canonical form is appropriate. A formulation for k in natural rivers is obtained by utilising a GP. Its form is consistent with the canonical form. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:42","2018-01-20 01:05:42","","511-523","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","streamflow; genetic algorithm; Rivers; dispersion; pollutant transport; spatial variation; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Stream flow; Dispersions; Transport properties; Contaminant transport; mass transport; Natural river; Boltzmann equation; Canonical form; Complex flow; Longitudinal dispersion coefficient; Natural streams; Target shape; Transport applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the shift toward dry conditions and their associated attributions across China are discussed in this study, primarily regarding the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). The results show that drought occurrences across China increased consistently during 1951–2014, especially during the recent twenty years. Most of the increased drought events happened under warm-dry conditions that coincided with relatively high temperature anomalies but without large anomalies in annual precipitation, implying an increase in hot drought events across China. Further analysis revealed that the change in drought occurrences were mainly due to the combined activity of external natural forcings and anthropogenic changes across China. However, external natural forcings were mainly responsible for the variability of droughts and anthropogenic influences for their increasing trends, suggesting that anthropogenic warming has increased hot drought occurrences, associated risks and impacts across China. With continued warming in the future, the impact of anthropogenic warming on the increased hot drought events will be further amplified. The probability of warm years is projected to significantly increase, and the occurrence probability of hot drought events (SPEI < −1.0) will increase to nearly 100% by the year 2050, even though the annual precipitation is projected to increase across China in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:50","2018-01-20 01:05:50","","306-318","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","China; evapotranspiration; global warming; climate change; Drought; probability; anthropogenic effect; risk assessment; Hydrology; nocv1; Risks; historical record; climate forcing; Anthropogenic influence; Mathematical models; high temperature; drought stress; Occurrence probability; Anthropogenic warming; Natural variability; External natural forcings; High-temperature anomalies; Hot drought events","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Light transmission visualization (LTV) has shown its accuracy and efficiency for measuring DNAPLs saturation and water content in the laboratory, but it cannot be implemented in three dimensional sandbox or field-scale sites. Recently developed electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has been applied in monitoring the migration and distribution of DNAPLs in bench- and field-scale studies. However, the evaluation of the ability of ERT for monitoring DNAPLs migration by a direct comparison of ERT with high-resolution techniques such as LTV within an experimental system is still lacking. Two sandbox experiments with different permeability conditions are conducted to quantitatively assess the capability of ERT for monitoring the DNAPLs migration. During the injections, LTV method is used to visualize the DNAPLs migration and provide high-resolution saturation data while ERT method is applied to capture the change of resistivity. The results from the comparison between LTV and ERT methods show that ERT is successful in detecting the accumulation and flow bypassing phenomenon around the low-permeability lenses, as well as the penetration through the high-permeability lenses. There is a fair correlation between the resistivity and saturation with overall correlation coefficients above 0.6, except at last stage. However, using classical regularization techniques (based on smoothness), the area of DNAPLs plume determined by ERT is commonly overestimated. Compared to the plume around the low-permeability lenses, the plume around the high-permeability lenses estimated by ERT is more extensive due to larger resistivity contrasts. In addition, ERT measurements indicate that the resistivity increase caused by the low-saturation DNAPLs is not apparent enough, which is likely to be covered up under the changing hydrogeochemical environments in field investigations. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2017","2018-01-20 01:05:59","2018-01-20 01:05:59","","254-266","","","544","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","groundwater; Groundwater monitoring; Visualization; water content; heterogeneity; environmental assessment; Heterogeneity; Groundwater; comparative study; environmental monitoring; spatial distribution; experimental study; Three dimensional computer graphics; visualization; quantitative analysis; Monitoring; laboratory method; electrical resistivity; Electrical resistivity tomography; tomography; permeability; Electric conductivity; hydrogeochemistry; plume; Light transmission; Dense non-aqueous phase liquids; liquid; transmissivity; chlorinated hydrocarbon; Chlorinated hydrocarbon; High-resolution techniques; Quantitative assessments; Regularization technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
